"  Moroni to Moheli. Turned out to be a pretty decent airline. Online booking worked well, checkin and boarding was fine and the plane looked well maintained. Its a very short flight - just 20 minutes or so so i didn't expect much but they still managed to hand our a bottle of water and some biscuits which i though was very nice. Both flights on time.",,,,,
" Moroni to Anjouan. It is a very small airline. My ticket advised me to turn up at 0800hrs which I did. There was confusion at this small airport. I was then directed to the office of AB Aviation which was still closed. It opened at 0900hrs and I was told that the flight had been put back to 1300hrs and that they had tried to contact me. This could not be true as they did not have my phone number. I was with a local guide and he had not been informed either. I presume that I was bumped off. The later flight did operate but as usual, there was confusion at check-in. The flight was only 30mins and there were no further problems. Not a good airline but it is the only one for Comoros.",,,,,
"  Anjouan to Dzaoudzi. A very small airline and the only airline based in Comoros. Check-in was disorganised because of locals with big packages and disinterested staff. The flight was fortunately short (30 mins). Took off on time and landed on time. With a short flight like there was of course no in-flight entertainment nor cabin service except for biscuits and a bottle of water, which was quite nice!",,,,,
"  Please do a favor yourself and do not fly with Adria. On the route from Munich to Pristina in July 2019 they lost my luggage and for 10 days in a row, despite numerous phone calls they were not able to locate it. 11 days later the luggage arrived at the destination completely ruined. Applying for compensation, they ignored my request. Foolishly again, I booked another flight with them (345 euros) Frankfurt - Pristina in September 2019. They cancelled the flight with no reason 24 hours before the departure. Desperate phone calls to customer service to get anything (rerouting, compensation, etc) were not responded. I will never fly again with Adria. What a disgrace! Shame on you Adria for constantly deceiving your customers.",,,,,
" Do not book a flight with this airline! My friend and I should have returned from Sofia to Amsterdam on September 22 and 3 days before, they sent us an SMS informing the flight was cancelled. For 3 straight days we tried to reach the airline and the web agent (e-dreams) and we did not get a solution. Finally, 18 hours before our cancelled flight time, and after 35 minutes on a call (waiting), the airline was able to get us on a flight with Lufthansa. Do not book Adria Airways, it is unreliable and in our case, it ruined our last days of holidays since we needed to be on the phones all day.",,,,,
  Had very bad experience with rerouted and cancelled flights last weekend with Adria airways. Original Route was Ljubljana to Sarajevo return. Two weeks before i received an email that the flight was cancelled. Offered route change was Ljubljana to Sarajevo via Munich. Flight back changed to Sarajevo-Pristina-Ljubljana. I accepted. The first flight via Munich was ok. Two hours before the return flight I got the email that the flight was cancelled. I had to rebook via hotline and had to accept a flight with Croatian to Zagreb. I reached Ljubljana 4 h later and had to organize Transport from Zagreb to Ljubljana on my own cost. Do not book flights with Adria airways. I heard that their financial situation is very very bad.,,,,,
"  Ljubljana to Zürich. Firstly, Ljubljana airport is terrible. Badly trained staff, unfriendly. Toilets are very dirty. Flight 2 hours delayed without any information. There is no Information desk so questions aren‘t possible. Never again will use this airline. Its even worse than the budget airlines and thats difficult. ",,,,,
"  First of all, I am not complaining about a specific flight. I am a Lufthansa frequent Flyer and I normally fly the route Munich - Timisoara. This summer season Lufthansa offered the flights on this route to Adria Airways, as they are a star alliance member. I can only tell that I have the worst experiences with them. In over 90% of the cases they are late, they don't fly on time. Always they offer the same excuse: they have no slot free. This is an unacceptable excuse, as all other companies flying on similar coridors seem not to have this problem. In addition, as LH Cityline was operating these flights I have almost never heard this excuse, or had this problem. I am flying on this route for 6 years already. They started also to cancel some flights. Maybe combine 2 flights into 1 to spare some money, who knows. The cabin crew is decent - not wow, not bad - but there also also situations when the staff are really rude and not customer oriented. I would recommend anyone to fly with this company. If you have the chance, book another company!",,,,,
  Worst Airline ever! They combined two flights to save costs. Instead of flying Pristina - Ljubliana - Zürich we now fly Pristina - Ljubliana - München - Zürich. Now we arrive 2.5h later at our destination.,,,,,
" Ljubljana to Munich. The homebase airport of Adria Airways is Ljubljana and it very small, relaxing and convenient. It is surrounded by the Alps and the departure was fantastic. The airplane was modern and the crew was nice. Ontime departure. Drinks without alcohol were free and I paid 4€ for my white wine. Considering that I had a cheap ticket I cannot complain. Upgrades would have been available for 30€ - which includes the lounge.",,,,,
  Zurich to Ljubljana. Very poor customer service. Flight was cancelled without sending any email confirmation. The flight I was rebooked seemed to be overbooked at the beginning (which was not true)and we had to wait 30 min to have our ticket changed. Very bad experience overall.,,,,,
"  Vienna to Sofia. The flight was delayed by 2 hours. The cabin crew was annoyed that they had to offer drinks to the passengers and passing by announced they would only give one drink per customer. And coffee was a nuisance and they made it clear, even though it was on their cart. The questions would normally go ""would you drink anything?"" and not ""what would you like to drink?"". Very bad customer service.",,,,,
"  We were traveling from Paris to Skopje on May 4th, via Ljubljana. Our flight from Ljubljana to Skopje, was canceled 10 days before our departure for no reason, leaving us in the middle of our connection at Ljubljana. Even if the company booked a hotel for us and made sure we could take a flight the next day, it prevented us from enjoying one more day in Macedonia. The company had agreed to reimburse the hostel night we had already paid but more than two months after our claim we still have no reply from the company. I e-mailed the company two times, called them on multiple occasion. The company said I would be reimbursed after 2 months. 2 months later, I still have not received anything. The experience with Adria Airways was overall very poor : - flight canceled for no reason - 2 out of 4 of the flights we took were delayed - terrible customer service, unable to give any answer to our online claim and not reimbursing the hostel night we had already paid",,,,,
"  Ljubljana to Munich. Adria's checkin system is obviously barely coping. It wasn't possible to obtain an electronic boarding pass (iphone wallet version) from Adria's site. The option was there but it failed without any further explanation. Further more I was not able to checkin to return flight online - neither through Adria nor Lufthansa web site. In the end I made it via Lufthansa mobile app. Go figure. Both issues were reported to customer care and both were ignored. I experienced the same customer care ""policy"" couple of years ago when my inquiry with customer support was basically ignored. Flight was actually operated by a Romanian company Carpatair. The cabin was outdated and dirty with a funny smell lingering around. The latter stuck to my clothes for the day - not that great if you are meeting a client. Cabin crew was also quite disorganised and mixed up orders of all passengers sitting around me. Would not fly again. Unfortunately they are the only company offering a direct flight from LJU to MUC.",,,,,
"  A very unpleasant experience for my family. We bought two return flights (Ljubljana-Prague-Ljubljana, Ljubljana-Warsaw-Ljubljana), and several days before departure both direct flights from and to Prague were canceled and a flight to Warsaw was merged with Prague flight (so added necessary stopover). Instead of a direct flight to Prague Adria Airways finally offered a transfer via Munich. When we arrived at the airport (21/6/2018), we found that the flight to Munich had more than an hour of delay, and therefore it was not possible to catch the next flight from Munich to Prague. The flight to Munich was full of people from the original canceled flight to Prague, who subsequently wanted to continue to Prague. Although the Adria Airways staff were present at the airport, no one came to inform the passengers and the result was tremendous confusion and lack of information. Ljubljana airport servicing staff finally informed us that Adria Airways staff refused to come! Also wasn't possible to call the Adria Airways hotline. Maybe it had been overloaded due to the number of disgruntled passengers because the next gate was full of people waiting for a delayed flight to Vienna, where there also wasn't anybody from Adria Airways who could provide any information. Unfortunately this flight left without us and we were all forced to ride from the Munich airport to a more than 30 km distant hotel and the next morning at 6am again back. Permanent cancellation of flights and subsequent ignorance of passengers are surely a way to reduce operating costs, but in the long-term this will cause the outflow of passengers to other airports around Slovenia, especially to Graz and to Zagreb.",,,,,
"  Frankfurt to Ljubljana. Flight was very comfortable, professional crew. The monitors above passengers provide informations about flight (speed, altitude, temperature, time to landing, etc.)",,,,,
"  Ljubljana to Frankfurt. Flight delayed for more than 2 hours due to technical problems. We were not given any food or water and when I requested some I was told to complain to Adria Airways website. Another plane was organized, more than 2 hrs later. The staff was trying to convince the passengers that their connection to Singapore will wait (they had 15 min in between the new flight arrival time and departure!), and that the flight to Frankfurt is 1 hr - and no wifi connectivity on flight!",,,,,
"  Ljubljana to Vienna. Overall, the flight services of Adria are those of an average, reliable, small European carrier. I have flown them many times over the years, and I have seldom experienced any problems with the flights themselves. Returning to Vienna from a visit to Albania and Slovenia in September, however, I had an encounter with Adria that has revealed just how much their customer service quality could be improved. Adria offers opportunities to purchase business class upgrades or empty economy class seats through Optiontown. Business class upgrades on Adria are a joke because you're paying at least 50EUR for an empty seat next to you and a snack. The option to purchase an empty economy class seat at 19EUR is a great deal though, in my opinion. Having selected this option for my LJU-VIE flight, I received a confirmation that my transaction had cleared and the extra seat had been assigned next to me. Fast forward to the actual flight: there had been an aircraft change from the CRJ-900 to an ATR-72 (Darwin Airlines/Etihad Regional), but I still had my empty seat. The ATR-72 has two seats that face towards the rear of the plane at the front of the cabin, and one of the women seated there was scared to fly backwards, so the flight attendant unilaterally reassigned her to my empty seat without asking. It's a short flight, and I didn't want to cause a scene, so I just let it all happen assuming I could easily get a refund for my 20EUR transaction. It took exactly one month for Adria's customer service team to respond to me, and they said that my ""business class upgrade"" had not cleared, so I was not charged. I had never requested a business class upgrade, and I was charged for the empty seat I had in fact requested, so I sent all of the relevant receipts and statements back to Adria. Three weeks later, I still have yet to receive a response, so I simply disputed the charge with my credit card company that was easily able to understand the issue and refunded the money. 3-4 weeks+ response time from customer service is absolutely embarrassing, and Adria should be ashamed of their operations. It's sad for an otherwise perfectly acceptable airline to lose a customer over 20EUR.",,,,,
" Two nice short flights from Ljubljana to Sarajevo and back. First flight with Adria, flight back with Adria Switzerland. Flight to Sarajevo delayed due to fog in Sarajevo, Adria quickly changed an aircraft so that it was possible to land in foggy weather (CRJ instead of ATR). Product depends weather it is Adria or Adria Switzerland. Adria with snack, water and buy on board product, Adria Switzerland with snack, water, tea and coffee and without buy on board. I personally prefer the second option. Adria Switzerland provided nicer and cosier atmosphere on board, somehow a kind of premium product compare to Adria mainline.",,,,,
 We were 11 people coming in with a short connection to Zurich hoping to continue with Adria to Ljubjana. We were before final call at the departure gate. Other people were still boarding. Adria had decided to rebook us and could not put us back on the plane. I and my wife had no checked in baggage. We had to wait 5 hours for next flight. This was extremely bad service and will do our utmost to never have to fly Adria again. We will also warn all our flying friends.,,,,,
"  Ljubljana to Munich after arriving from Atlanta on Delta. Flight was ok, short 50 min. But they lost our baggage, if we didn't persistently call the airport we wouldn't have our bags for a week because they are lazy. One bag was badly damaged and things missing. We did everything they told us to do to report it but they didn't honor it and it took 3 months for them to pay us around 20% of the replacements and extra expenses we had for days. Very rude, try to blame it on the customer, if you don't live in Slovenia and your only communication is over emails it takes 2 to 3 weeks for them to reply even if you send them email right after they sent one. That day they lost baggage for 3 different passengers and when we had our return flight there were two more passengers that said they lost their bags so this is normal for that airline. It was a cheaper option to fly with them, but it was not worth the extra cost later. I would never fly this airline again. ",,,,,
" Ljubljana to Zurich on April 18th. Adria Airways has become in recent years a more reliable airline which I use for these flights. I can't remember a delay and I fly them once a month. Flight Attendants are professionel. Food and Drinks (except water) have to be purchased. Sandwiches are tasty, wine choice could be better. Newspapers are available for free but mostly in Slovenian language only. Seat pitch on emergency exits are above international standards and safety seems to be their Nr. 1 aim as it is one of the rare airlines having extra safety instructions for passengers seated on emergency exit seats. Their inflight magazine is available online or printed. Not necessarily exciting but solid and reliable product which I can recommend.",,,,,
"  Ljubljana to Vienna. After a fast boarding procedure the plane took off in time. The seat was quite comfortable although the cabin looked a bit nagged. Despite the fact that this was a regional flight, Adria Airways offered a Wifi service with good connection, an IFE system and free chat function amongst the passengers. A very friendly crew welcomed the passengers onboard and started their service which was pretty impressive for this 50 minutes flight. The business meal tasted great and we landed punctually in Vienna.",,,,,
"  Two very short flights with Adria Airways from Ljubljana to Vienna and back. Both on time. CRJ aircrafts new, cabin fresh and seats comfortable. On both flights welcome from the flight deck with all information about the flight before take-off. Cabin crews polite and professional. Overall nice and comfortable flights.",,,,,
"  I boarded the CRJ900 flight and at my seat I had the table down and on it a pre-flight snack, water and juice. What a great surprise as you arrive to your seat. Loved it. Although the meal wasn't the best, it was good and the wine very good. The first row is very spacious and lots of legroom, which is not always guaranteed for bulkhead. I find the new generation CRJ900 plane very comfy with big windows so was very pleased with the whole flight.",,,,,
"  Fly only if no other connection, I am a frequent business flyer mostly departing from Vienna or Munich to destinations. The flight with Adria was chosen due to convenience, however if I had an option to choose next time, the value for money is not there nor the experience. Outdated aircraft (buzzing from AC in the upper compartment present the whole time of descending and extremly anoying. Complimentary glass of water and snack (pretzles). Other options only upon payment (does not seem acceptable fot the price over 400 eur). Not to mention online check in unavailable from Paris, while the traffic to the airport is unpredictable, hence online check in is a must. All in all I would fly Adria again only if there is no other option left. The aircraft staff though very nice.",,,,,
"  Munich to Ljubljana. Adria Airways as the national carrier pretty much holds a monopoly in this market and even those few carriers who had flown limited scheduled routes into the Slovenian capital, Air France and Swiss, have regretfully withdrawn their services. I have spent a lifetime of flying and the Adria product, I am sorry to say, is grossly inadequate. There is nothing appealing about Adria's offering and what incentive do they have to lift their standard when there is no competition to stimulate improvement? The entire fleet is tired and outdated. The business class product is non existent, staff are at best disinterested, leaning towards unfriendly. And what's with those announcements? They are completely impossible to understand, not just in English and German but also in Slovenian. If not having flown as often as I have to know what the announcements are about, there is no hope in hell that a normal person can understand the dribble that comes over the PA. Guess how many uninformed passengers does that make for? If one is not fluent in a language, and heavily accented, then one must slow down so others can hopefully understand you. But what's their excuse of not pronouncing Slovenian correctly. Everything is executed at such a speed so they can place a tick against that task, yet no care is invested to make sure the task is executed effectively. ! Pick up your game or your end will come one day when monopoly is broken (look around the world to learn from other such stories).  I have found a solution to avoid flying Adria Airways where possible - Turkish Airlines presence is now pretty strong in LJU and I can't fault their service. Whenever flying into LJU from a geographical destination where IST is a logical place to transit, TK is my carrier of choice.",,,,,
"  Ljubljana to Amsterdam. First experience with Adria Airways was underwhelming and unimpressive. Flight sat on tarmac fully boarded for 20 minutes without explanation; causing 20 minute delay on arrival without comment from crew and despite many passengers with tight connections in AMS. Crew was the least personal I've experienced in my 30+ flights in 2016. The crew quickly passed through the cabin holding a large bottle of water but without offering it; everything else is buy-on-board at unappealing prices. Aging CRJ-900 showed its wear, limited on-air entertainment, but able to select bulkhead seat at check-in so legroom was good. Compared to inbound flight on Air France, Adria lacked any sort of the polished, personal touch that its in-flight magazine claims it wants to project. To LJU, however, the options are few and the schedules erratic, so Adria will often be the only rational choice for many sectors.",,,,,
"  Ljubljana to Brussels. Two very different experiences. Flight from Ljubljana to Brussels nice and comfortable, CRJ900 cabin clean and pleasant. Very professional and nice cabin crew on JP376 flight on Aug 03. JP395 flight back on Aug 30 could not be more different. A319 cabin tired and uncomfortable, flight almost empty, cabin crew could not be more unprofessional, tired and not interested. A nightmare of a crew. The worst was a purser. I have never experienced such unmotivated flight attendant with totally not acceptable appearance. You can have a bad day, however even if it is your worst day ever, you should look professional enough for a flight purser. At the end of the day with buy on board service on JP flights the flight attendants make all the difference on board of the aircraft.",,,,,
"Booked this flight after many years using Easyjet, got the flight at a very reasonable price, actually cheaper than easyJet. Flight outbound and inbound were ok and although departing slightly late, we arrived pretty close to scheduled time, outbound landing in Ljubljana was a bit rough. The staff were all pleasant enough and served complementary water, a small selection of other food and drink were for sale but some advertised items were not available. Seating is now a bit cramped with even less leg room than Easyjet, I am just 6' and my kness were toching the seat in front and were crushed further by the person in front moving and the person behind digging their knees into my back as thay wer oviosly struggling for room too. Much more cramped than the previous time I flew Adria over 10 years ago.",,,,,
"  Gatwick to Ljubljana. Do not rely on Adria Airways to be communicative when anything goes wrong. My luggage went missing and nothing until they wanted to deliver it 10 days later. Adria do not take criticism well. I would say they are in denial most of the time. Their computer systems, like their staff, do not talk to each other. You have been warned!",,,,,
"  Tallinn to Stockholm with Adria Airways. Clean and fresh aircraft with Nordica livery. Pleasant boarding staff, clear announcements from FAs and cockpit informative. An innovative approach to meal service - selection of ""make your own sandwich"" - very fresh for 5.50 euros. Coffee, tea and water complimentary. Flight slightly delayed because of technical overhaul.",,,,,
"Flew roundtrip on this short route from Zurich to Ljubljana with Adria Airways. On-time departure and arrival both times. No turbulence. Splendid views of the Alps. Both times, at both locations, bus trip to aircraft located off-gate. Flight announcements in Slovenian and passable English. A small glass of water served. Everything else - from cola to candy to croissant - available for purchase. Was able to select my seat in advance. Luggage left at staircase was available for retrieval at bottom of stairs on arrival. Ticket and gate agents very polite and spoke excellent English. The airline did its job. It got me to my destination on time. It is an impressive and efficient small airline that made the journey very pleasant.",,,,,
"  Two short flights with Adria Airways (Ljubljana - Zurich and Munich -Ljubljana), both on time, aircrafts new, cabin bright and clean. Nice and professional service on both flights. On the morning flight out of Ljubljana I did not take any free newspapers and just said that I will sleep. The chief flight attendant before take off brought me a pillow for a more comfortable sleeps. Nice touch.",,,,,
"Lodz to Paris CDG and Munich to Lodz with Adria Airways. Decent service for short hops, like those I took. Small and cramped cabin in a clean CRJ700. The flight LCJ-CDG was nearly empty, so I felt like being in a private jet. MUC-LCJ with 65% load factor. Check-in via internet with an option to select seats without any problem, both flights on time. Cabin staff rather absent, just served a glass of water for free. Although we were informed about possibility to connect to on-board wi-fi, I couldn't manage to do that. If you do not expect a 5-star service, Adria should be a good option for quick and not too expensive flight.",,,,,
"Adria Airways flight from Pristina to Munich was smooth, return flight was terrible. Get notified flight is delayed (can see it on tarmac). Told there is a technical issue and we will fly to Ljubljana, Slovenia for a connecting flight. Reality, the flight was half full and we were forced onto another Adria flight so they could save a buck. Our recompense, a free meal at airport. Never flying with them again. When Lufthansa reps tell you this always happens it should be a sign.",,,,,
"Ljubljana to Amsterdam in Adria Airways Economy class. No free snacks or even drinks, which is very sad for a Star Alliance partner, because their fare prices are high but offer is similar to low cost airlines. Beverages which they sell in their ""Air shop"" looks nice on advert, beautiful pictures, but when you buy it, you get small sandwich with bad taste. I figured out It's better to buy a sandwich in airport caffe, than onboard.",,,,,
"14 flights with Adria Airways this year. Flights usually on time, new aircraft, clean and bright cabins. Cabin crew members can be nice and professional or just fine. I do not know what happened in last few months; according to the last flight experience, this is not the right direction. On a flight to Moscow I experienced cabin crew getting from gloomy on a flight to SVO to even gloomier on a flight back to LJU. No smiles, just robotic and not interested in passengers and their comfort.  Well, at the end of the day, the real difference is the crew attitude. ",,,,,
"Flew in business class on Adria Airways  A319 on this short flight (1 h) from SKP to LJU. Very friendly and helpful staff - excellent business class service including a hot meal, warm bread cheese and marmalade. Better than the LH business class service. Flight arrived 25 minutes before STA - good job. Information about the route, weather and connections were given by the captain. Legroom in row 1 good, nice seats. Highly recommended this small but very functional airline.",,,,,
"Frankfurt to Ljubljana with Adria Airways. Boarding was on-time, but aircraft was parked on remote gate about 15 minutes from main terminal. So we departed about 25 minutes late. Service onboard was poor, with no complimentary drinks or snacks - they are available only for sale. Arrival was 15 minutes later than scheduled. Crew was friendly.",,,,,
"Adria Airways has the price of a regular airline, but the service of a low cost airline. All the beverages and food are for purchase. The seats are fine, staff is friendly. Since we usually travel very early in the morning or very late in the evening, we use the flight to rest. Every time we ask for a pillow, we get one. It might sound strange, but this is very important for us.",,,,,
"Excellent flights both ways with Adria Airways from Manchester to Ljubljana. Staff friendly but unobtrusive. Leg room far better than most economy flights, seats comfy and plenty of storage space. Flights on time, quick and efficient boarding and disembarking, smooth take offs and landings. All in all a very pleasant experience.",,,,,
Outbound flight FRA/PRN A319. 2 hours 10 min flight. I thought drinks/snacks for sale but sandwich soft drinks were served complimentary. Inbound flights SKP/LJU/FRA CRJ900. each 1 hour 30 min flight. Skyshop menu was in a seat pocket and drinks/snacks were for sale. All flight crews were friendly. Security check at the Ljubljana airport for transit passengers was chaos however it's possible to go to a gate within 30min.,,,,,
Two short hops ZRH-LJU and LJU-VIE. Very fast on CRJ 90. Seats comfortable and crew was fine. Ground services good and lounge was quite nice.,,,,,
Flew Zurich-Ljubljana on JP365 newish CRJ900. Flight almost full departure on time. Service on board by 2 pleasant and friendly female flight attendants. I bought coffee mineral water and a very nice and fresh filled croissant for EUR 6. Good value!,,,,,
Adria serves this 100 min flight from Ljubljana to Amsterdam on a brand new CRJ900 Next Gen which has a hugely improved cabin. Much more spacious higher ceiling and with big windows. The seats seem to be more comfortable and have more legroom. The business class is not separated from the main cabin though not even with the standard back seat curtain. The food offering could be slightly improved for usually I've had good meals on Adria.,,,,,
"WAW-SKJ Economy. No free snacks or drinks on this Star Alliance partner. Just full legacy carrier fares for basically a budget airline. Flying out of Poland had no Euros or USD on me. I was thirsty and asked to purchase a bottle of water. The stewardess said that I could not buy it and could not use a credit card or purchase it in cash without their preferred currency. When I pointed out that they were able to sell duty free with visa cards she huffed and puffed and basically said it would be ""difficult"". She never offered me a tiny cup of water. On the way back I switched to Turkish Airlines via IST and got a free 3 course meal on both segments and friendly service.",,,,,
Sarajevo-Frankfurt via Ljubljana. I loved flying with them. Very small airline but a functional one. Crew friendly on board nothing special regarding entertainment or service. But flight duration's were short too so nothing to complain about. What I loved the most was a fast transit process in Ljubljana since its small airport and immigration was very fast. Would choose them again on my future trips.,,,,,
I had flights from Paris to Sarajevo via Ljubljana. Adria Airways provides a low cost product these days. The food and beverages become for purchase including water. This is acceptable for short flights but it should be clearly indicated during the ticket purchase on their web-site. There are no hot options and quality of sandwiches is really poor. Besides the service was very friendly and efficient. Both flights arrived on time.,,,,,
LJU to FRA and back both flights were on time. Flights were made by CRJ900 NextGen aircraft. Very clean cabin and comfortable seats. Staff were always nice and friendly. New SkyShop service was excellent with nice prices and it's not too expensive.,,,,,
On my Ljubljana - Munich flight in business class Adria used the CRJ-900 Next Generation which is a great plane. I love the very large windows which are at a proper height so that you don't have to bend your neck down in order to look out the window like on the older versions of this Bombardier equipment. Moreover the aircraft is very quiet. It's a short flight but in business class you got a good meal and a comfy seat.,,,,,
Flights from LJU to ZRH and back all on time. In Economy class was served just coffee tea an water but it's fine for one and a half hour flight. Very friendly and helpful cabin crew members. Very clean and comfortable cabin on CRJ900 aircraft.,,,,,
I was very satisfied with the CRJ 900 on my flight from Zagreb to Istanbul. The aircraft's are very clean fresh new and the staff was very helpful. Besides I felt very safe and comfortable in the aircraft.,,,,,
I was on JP650 the evening departure to Istanbul on 28th August. It was on a very clean Airbus A319 and it was a light load flight. The crew were warm and kind especially the Purser who took her time walked and talked to several passengers. They even offered me a pillow and blanket which I appreciated. A warm refreshment with selections of cold/hot beverage were offered on this 2 hours flight. We took off about 5 minutes earlier and landed more or less 20 minutes earlier. It was a relaxing flight and I do hope they will be flying to more destinations in the future since Slovenia is a beautiful and lovely country to visit.,,,,,
VIE-LJU LJU-MUC Aug 4-15th CRJ200. Both flights very good. Clean cabin comfortable seats (always cramped in CRJ) efficient and attractive cabin crew announcements made in Slovenian and pretty good English and German. Water bottle for each passenger even on short flights like these and coffee offered on second flight. Aircraft departed on time boarding was efficient captain kept passengers updated no IFE of course bags arrived very quickly. In LJU nicely stocked Priority Pass lounge and is a nice small airport MUC is an awesome airport to connect through. Would highly recommend this little regional airline and Slovenia is beautiful.,,,,,
If I have to fly a regional jet then I prefer the new generation CRJ 900 which Adria used on today's flight from Amsterdam to Ljubljana. It has much bigger windows which makes the cabin look more spacious. Despite Adria cutting back on a lot of their routes for what it is the service food and cabin is OK.,,,,,
Istanbul-Ljubljana-Munich and return. Pre-take off on all sectors given an individual bottle of water and plastic glass. During flight some pleasant cold snacks tasty and attractively presented. Drinks on demand. Cabin crew all very friendly good eye contact and knowledge of English. Seats just normal economy ones. Transfers in Ljubljana a bit confusing. In one direction followed signs into a passage which was locked. A couple of minutes later somebody came and let us out to go through security. On the return leg did not have to go through security there. Disappointing that Ljubljana Duty Free shop does not sell alcohol after 9pm. Also that the Slovenian liqueur speciality advertised in their in-flight Duty Free catalogue is not carried on board. All flights on time.,,,,,
Return flight Paris-Skopje via Ljubljana. All flights were on time and nice very clean planes / good flight crew. Seats were comfortable enough for a 1-2 hours flight. Boarding was easy for all flights. Ljubljana airport is very small and nice. The only downside is the absence of any snack. FA served only water and coffee/tea. This is almost like low cost airline. It is recommended airline for short flights.,,,,,
BEG-LJU-BEG with CRJ200 great regional airline with excellent airport. Too bad the airport is not too busy. Both flights were on time and they had Duty Free service with certain items on special prices. Their tickets are not good may be that is a reason that they are on economic difficulties.,,,,,
I fly at least once a month ZRH-LJU-ZRH. My experience is that the staff on the ground need a better education regarding how to care of passengers. If it comes to a delay and pax have to go to the info desk to change tickets and so on then you really see of how unfriendly and unprepared staff are. The airplanes could be cleaned better and I do also see some room for improvement for the flight staff.,,,,,
LTN to LJU outbound with CRJ200 return with CRJ900. Both legs on time. Just a tiny sandwich and only one round of drinks but ok for a 2 hr flight. Slow and unfriendly staff. Very little room in CRJ200 even though it was not full. Passengers had to pick up their luggage from hold upon arrival to LJU and carry the bags to the terminal building.,,,,,
Ljubljana to Brussels with CRJ900. Boarding on time. The aircraft looked quite new and very clean. Meal served was above my expectations. Cabin crew were very nice. The only thing that was bad was the seating arrangement. I sat in 13th or 14th row and that row didn't have any windows! Otherwise flight was ok.,,,,,
LJU-FRA and FRA-LJU. First flight on time return flight slightly delayed due to heavy snow in FRA. Flight attendants attentive and helpful. Delicious snacks on both flights. While waiting for take off on first leg passengers were served Slovenian sparkling wine juices and water. Comfortable seats and generous leg- room with CRJ 900 to FRA and CRJ 200 to LJU. Both airplanes very clean and seemingly well maintained all in all quite an enjoyable experience.,,,,,
LJU-FRA-LJU. Both flights on time. Flight attendants are friendly however they allowed 3 different versions of female uniforms on the same flight. A white T-shirts under an apron looks very casual for a flag-carrier. The planes are quite worn and promotional messages on the seats for an insurance company look cheap. Food is ok taking in consideration that it was just an 1 hour flight.,,,,,
Smart and efficient service. Small planes but as a tall man (6ft 4) I did not feel cramped either on the CRJ-200 (AMS-LJU) or the CRJ-900 (LJU-AMS). The cabin crew were friendly and the food for such a short flight was good. Also the price was right.,,,,,
FRA-VIE in Business Class. A great little airline transferred to them after our transatlantic flight. The advantage for the CRJ sitting on a remote stand was that we got a really interesting ride around Frankfurt airport with operating aircraft taxiing landing taking off all around us. Onboard the crew were pleasant and managed to serve a hot lunch to us during the 60 mins flight. We departed and arrived on time and the flight was smooth.,,,,,
London Gatwick to Ljubljana and Ljubljana to Vienna in Business Class. Delayed slightly at Gatwick but that happens. Otherwise very good flights. Cabin crew friendly and welcoming ensuring that you were okay - without being too pushy and forward. Short flights and light meals/snacks served.,,,,,
ZRH to LJU as a continuation to a flight with Swiss. Adria were not as good as Swiss but they did make us feel welcome onboard and look after us. The return flight was much better than the outbound flight with the cabin crew smiling and talking to passengers. The CRJ was clean and looked in better condition than other airlines equipment I have flown in the past.,,,,,
I fly Adria a lot (at least once a month) and find them ok. The service is mixed. Often the supervisor is not ready for boarding and there is no-one to greet. Last time when I boarded the crew were having their photo taken on the tarmac so we all had to stand and wait until they finished. Food is fine and the hand luggage service where it is delivered on the tarmac on landing works well on the CRJ aircraft.,,,,,
I fly Adria quite a lot (aprox 2 flts a month). My routes are normally VIE-LJU or ZRH-LJU. I always wondered why Adria is not high profile airline being small can be a plus. The CRJ200 and 1000 are OK specially 1000 which are brand new and also A319 latest delivery. I hate that they never board on time neither depart on time. For 20 pax you should be in the air in about 15 min. But they lose a lot of time after the boarding is completed and the take off. The service is worse every time. Now you get a small pack of seeds or dry fruit and a bottle of water. The flights are normally only 30 mins but nevertheless I miss the nice box with good sandwich water and a small dessert. The price is well overpriced for what they offer. There were old inflight magazines in cabin. Crew is good but sometimes too familiar with passengers or fellow colleagues.,,,,,
"This was my first time with Adria. Short hop from KBP to LJU. The airline is 3 star but my ticket had 5 star price tag. Online sale worked fine online check-in system issued me a pass with wrong boarding time (nearly 2 hours early). Luckily their call center worked well and I was told to report to the airport at normal time and use ""wrong"" boarding pass. It really worked. There were about 14 passengers onboard Canadair200. The plane was new and clean. Seats were very narrow however seat pitch was okay. My seat didn't work well so I did take off and landed in reclined position. Food was much below average (small cheese sandwich) bar service was good and generous. Flight departed late but made it in the air and landed about ontime. Crew were cheerful and attentive. My special meal was delivered and was okay (much better then standard sandwiches offered to other passengers). All in all a real strong 3 star experience but overpriced ticket. Also saw no difference between business and economy cabin. Same seats for different price.",,,,,
ZRH-LJU-ZRH with CRJ-900. New plane with pleasant cabin interior and comfortable leather seats. Flights on time food ok. Adria Airways has new uniforms (60 style) and the flight attendants are attentive. Web-Check-in works excellent.,,,,,
It is reliable and with good connections between Balkans and Western Europe. However I always find the service on the leg between Skopje and Ljubljana to be lower quality than the leg Ljubljana- Amsterdam Ljubljana - Frankfurt etc. The crew is not so friendly and helpful they always offer tuna sandwiches (assuming that because of the Muslim travelers). I insisted on a ham sandwich and never got it. Twice on the leg Ljubljana-Skopje (or vice versa). If Adria pretends to be a quality part of Star Alliance it shouldn't distinguish among the passengers which fly Skopje - Ljubljana and those flying from Ljubljana to Western Europe.,,,,,
LGW-LJU in Y class. Adria Airways now offer check in on line so it was straight to security which was great. Boarding quick and efficient. Plane downgraded from CRJ9 to CRJ2 but emergency exit seat reservation honoured. Waited on the stand for 30 minutes with no communication from the flight deck. Service was nice with sandwiches hot and cold drinks. Cabin crew were quite robotic seems that pursers are trained not to smile under any circumstances. If crew would have been bit more cheerful and communication from the flight deck bit better it would have been 4*.,,,,,
London to Tirana via Ljubljana Economy Class. 30 minutes late on first leg due to air traffic restrictions at Gatwick but Adria held the connecting flight for us even though there were only a handful of people transferring from the London flight. The food was adequate on both legs and the crew were friendly. All in all a perfectly acceptable journey and I would fly Adria again.,,,,,
Ljublijana-Amsterdam. A great little airline. Although the CRJ-200 is a little cramped the service was good with a proper meal adequate refreshments and competent cabin crew. Their inflight magazine is in English and Slovenian and has an interesting mix of articles and company information. Same can't be said about Brnk international airport however! This airport needs a 'spruce up' to say the least.,,,,,
FRA-VIE-FRA on CRJ200. Cheapest option when compared to Lufthansa and Austrian plying this short 1.5 hour flight. Small plane meant a long bus ride to remote stand position. Larger carry-on bags had to be deposited in a trolley parked next to the plane. Aircraft spotless but leather seats showing their age - quite saggy in the squab. Service consisted of a choice of crusty cheese or ham roll followed by drinks tea & coffee. FAs smiling. The return was similarly uneventful but again a long bus ride at FRA. Luggage claim was quick.,,,,,
BRU-LJU-BRU. Outward flight on a CRJ200 very nice - comfortable excellent service and a good breakfast. Return flight on a 737 leased from Ukrainian airlines was also reasonable despite the limited legroom. Earning Star Alliance points also a plus - would recommend.,,,,,
I often fly with Adria (50 flights per year). Since Adria is member of Star Alliance there are pretty good connections to the most destinations in Europe. The onboard service is good staff quiet nice. Home base airport in Ljubljana has been upgraded and is getting more international. The business lounge is not on the level it should be - old furniture bad food choice dark. The 3 stars that have been given to Adria are correct.,,,,,
LGW-LJU-LGW on an older but clean A320. Outwards in 7A with plenty of legroom return in 12F with adequate legroom but need to be careful as the plastic shell on the bottom of the seat in front had started to crack with some sharp edges. Cheese roll served outbound and a jam filled croissant on the return - better than nothing but room for improvement. Coffee and soft drinks free but only one round early in the flight. Very pleasant crew on both sectors. Only gripe was baggage collection at LJU - three flights on one carousel and they seemed to unload baggage in batches from each flight turn about which caused chaos. The second carousel sat unused for the first 40 minutes waiting!,,,,,
Frankfurt-Ljubljana-Munich in business class: the first flight was on a B737 in the colours of Ukraine International and that plane's interior was substandard while the second flight was on a new CRJ. Both flights on time and without glitch. The service is friendly but meals should be improved. Overall they gave the impression of being a pleasant short haul airline.,,,,,
Zurich-Ljubljana return. About 2 hours+ journey. Both sector uses the Bombardier Regional Jet CRJ200. Small plane but the 2-3 crews on both sectors were friendly and the service efficient. Seats were comfortable and the planes in good clean conditions. Light meals were served - generally a roll here or a pie there plus drinks. The inflight magazine is surprisingly rich with information on Slovenian culture and way of life and is one of the best I have read. You board the planes on the tarmac via buses from the gates though and not through connecting bridges.,,,,,
LGW-LJU return. Outbound was on A320 seated towards the front of Y-class on a very empty flight. The crew were friendly enough and served a ham or cheese roll and round of drinks. LJU airport was easy to use and out within minutes. The coach ride into town goes through some nice Slovenian countryside. Return was on a B737-500 flight was full and had a middle seat but exit row (9E) seat pitch was great. Again right after take off was served with a cream pie desert and drinks. Crew were again friendly and another smooth flight that landed about 15mins ahead of schedule.,,,,,
LGW-LJU-LGW last week overall impressed with standard of service on A320. The food in economy was very basic but I didn't expect any! Drinks free. Was allocated row 11 (emergency exit) with out asking she said your very tall(6'4) I will give you some more leg room! Only minor complaint was the seat base comfort it was rock hard like sitting on a wood bench. On the return the seat in row 25 was little better they seem to have cut back on the foam. Crew were excellent a nice airline all in all.,,,,,
DUB-NAP. Was expecting very poor standards of both safety and comfort from this airline but was surprised. Flight at 5.00 am and the FA's were refreshed and alert. Pre flight safety procedures were clear and as high a standard as any other 3 star airline. The seats were quite hard and leg room was limited but the flight was made pleasant by friendly FA's. In flight catering was poor considering it was a four hour flight. We were handed almost frozen sandwiches and a juice box. Baggage collection was mayhem. All in all the flight was fair and would fly Adria again - but the airline does not compare to other 3 star airlines such as Aer Lingus and KLM.,,,,,
Frankfurt to Vienna and was quite satisfied. I was surprised when the flight attendant started giving out meals as I did not expect to be fed at all on such a short flight of only 55 minutes. It was perhaps a bit cramped on board the Canadair Regional Jet though I wouldn't complain about it. Crew was overall quite friendly and efficient.,,,,,
Flew to Ljubljana from Gatwick. Plane was a new Canadair Regional Jet small (40 seats) but good leg room and comfortable. Both cabin crew were friendly. Food was just a cheese or ham roll but fine for a 1 hr 40 minute flight. And Adria were one of the only airlines leaving Gatwick that evening not to be delayed. Return flight was an A320 full comfortable and good service once again. Would recommend Adria again and worth paying the extra 20quid over Easyjet for flying from Gatwick and not having to pay for food or drink.,,,,,
Round trip LGW - LJU in Economy Class both legs on an A320. Service pretty friendly planes clean & well-maintained flights on time. Food on each leg (outbound mid-morning return early morning) was a simple processed cheese roll though for a two-hour flight the food is probably not the most important aspect of the journey. All-in-all a pretty reasonable experience with no major complaints.,,,,,
I have used their VIE-FRA-VIE service several times. All flights were on time the atmosphere on board (CRJ) fine service is friendly although their snack and drinks are not outstanding. But for a flight of 1 hour what should it be? Codesharing with LH enables to collect miles though they dont count for status.,,,,,
Flew march 12/14 on JP from ZRH-LJU-ZRH. The flights were on time the flight attendants nice and helpful. The sandwich has got an upgrade and is now equal to LH. A Minus point was that they were handing out only Apple Juices - if you wanted to have wine or other drinks you had to ask specifically for it. This gives me kind of a cheap impression as it seems to the passenger that they wanted to hide it from them. The wine they served was below industry standards and not what a wine country like Slovenia should serve its guests on their trip to the country. I absolutely agree that on such short legs there is no necessity of any food/drinks however either this is clearly defined in the service guide of the airline or then crews should adhere to their service guidelines.,,,,,
Round trip LGW - LJU in Business Class. Check-in staff at LGW very efficient and friendly. A320 clean and staff most helpful. Food and Wine need improvement. Flights all on time and overall a pleasant experience.,,,,,
In July 2003 I flew London (Gatwick)-Ljubljana-Skopje return in Business Class. Overall I was quite impressed. All flights departed and arrived on time and the onboard service was efficient and reasonably friendly. Hot meals were served on all flights although the quality of these varied from disgusting to just OK. All drinks were complimentary. The aircraft (A320 and CRJ) were modern and spotlessly clean. Business Class seating is identical to economy with a moveable curtain. Transiting at Ljubljana was painless although it is a very small airport and the Business Class lounge is nothing special. I would happily fly with them again although they do need to improve the quality of their meals.,,,,,
I have just returned from a long weekend in Ljubljana flying on Adria from London Gatwick. The outbound flight was ok (food portions were a bit stingy given the 2 hour 20 minute flight time) and we arrived early into Ljubljana. Beware about arriving on a Saturday - the coach to the city centre are few and far between. I ended up taking a taxi which cost me 6500 SIT (about UKP 20) whereas the bus was 600 SIT (1.40). On the return flight Adria cancelled the flight for 'technical reasons'. Judging by the low number of people that went to the passenger service counter I think the reason for cancellation may have been more economic than technical. I was rerouted via Munich which added over an hour and a half to the journey and we flew into Heathrow (with BA) instead of Gatwick which left me with a useless train ticket and no way of getting home. The flight to Munich with Adria was good and an edible snack was served with apple juice. Despite the problems with the return journey Adria seems to be a reasonable airline and is an ok (if not the only) choice to get to this country.,,,,,
I have flown Adria recently on a LH code share from Munich to Ljubjana and return. In both cases the plane was a brand new CRJ. Both flights were really smooth and the crews really efficient and helpful. Pilots kept us informed about everything during both flights. It was sunset and dusk and the flight over the alps was absolutely scenic. Despite the narrow cabin of the CRJ the pitch is quite generous and the leather seats comfortable. Both flights lasted 45 minutes and from MUC to LJU I travelled tourist class. Normally in short flights there isnt time for much than a drink. We receive an apple juice a cheese and salad sandwich plus coffee and tea. The LJU-MUC and due to an overbooking was on business. We were offered an orange juice prior to departure and then a tasty breakfast consisting in bacon and scramble eggs fruit salad a croissant and coffe and tea. Superb for such a short segment. Not being a prime choice its an airline which is pleasant to flight.,,,,,
"  At check-in, we were told that our checked baggage was too heavy (limit 8kg/17lbs even though the website said 23kg/50lb limit), and we needed to reduce the weight. We were put to the side so we could move our dirty laundry from the suitcases and put into tote bags (purchased from the nearby shop) that we could carry on. This was both embarrassing and frustrating. The plane was an hour late for our connecting flight. They didn't tell us, but fortunately (after running through the airport), our connection was also late, so we did make the plane. They stopped food service short, so the last 5 rows didn't get any food. This was not due to weather, but just bad timing of the stewards. We still had 30 minutes to land, so they could have quickly handed out the sandwiches, but they decided not to provide service to the last few rows. I don't know if it was due to poor planning of the start of food service, or of taking too much time in the middle rows. Instead of treating us like the rest of the passengers, we felt like 3rd class citizens. Very poor service.",,,,,
"  I had a flight me and my husband from Stockholm to Cairo with connection flight in Athens. The connecting flight number was A3930, from Athens to Cairo. The planned departure time was 11:55 pm June 25th. The flight was delayed by nearly 6 hours from the planned departure time. We were informed the flight will be delayed for 1 hour before boarding. Before the new departure time, we boarded normally. After that, a lot of time has passed “ more that 1 hour” while we are inside the aircraft and we don’t take off and no information were given to us by the crew. From the aircraft windows we could see some workers taking bags in and out the aircraft. The crew told us they are having problems with luggage.  We are kept in the aircraft to nearly 4 hours before the captain told us that we can leave the aircraft and go to sit in the airport till the problem is solved.  Nothing was offered to us in the airport, no food, drinks or anything. In the meantime I tried to contact the Aegean Airlines hotline to help us, it was nearly 5:00 am already, but the contact person told me that she can not know any information about my flight situation because she has a limited access to information and she cannot help and I can call again after 7:00 am for another contact who has more access. At nearly 6:00 am the crew called us to board again but we didn’t take off till 6:35 anyways because the crew was replaced by a new one. We reached Cairo airport finally to find that our baggage didn’t reach Cairo airport anyway and we waited for 2 weeks till they reached Cairo airport. The delay collectively was from 11:55 pm to 6:35 am. We expected an apology on what happened and meaningful compensation as an acknowledgment of what they did. We complained to the company and their reply was that they were sorry for the delay and they offered the least compensation stated by passengers’ rights “250 euros”. They mentioned nothing about the problems that are caused by the poor handling of the problems they had. ",,,,,
" Very poor customer service. I am travelling with a baby paid to be in the front rows and when I wanted to add an extra seat for my daughter everything started. They asked me if I want the same seats, I said yes and they put me and the 5 month old baby in different seats. I asked that obviously we need to be together. Then they moved me in to row 19. Then they couldn’t find me on the flight, they couldn’t give me a seat with the excuse that it’s not for the baby when it was before. Then they asked me to send an email somewhere else if I wanted to take back my money and when I insisted that’s crazy they said ok we will refund you and send you an email, nothing received. They really don’t know what they are doing there.",,,,,
" Party of 4, 2 couples traveling together, last minute 1 hour before our seats changed. I upgraded everyone to row 11, now one is in 11, 3 are in 26th row. We were told the plane changed and we can't honor your seat selection. Poor customer service. We were not the only party where the seats changed. When I called customer service he stated well this happens occasionally",,,,,
" This is one of the worst experiences I’ve ever dealt with through the use of an airline. It was the most frustrating, time-consuming and displeasing experience imaginable when attempting to travel via plane. No matter what, never use Aegean Airlines under any circumstances. The staff were inconsiderate and extremely incompetent, showing no regard for the passengers well being and failing to explain any of the trouble we were put through. The staff and airline in general had no interest in doing their job properly and ultimately put me through the worst airline experience possible.",,,,,
 On the way to Santorini airplane lost all our luggage - 3 bags! They found it after 4 days. On the way back they lost another bag! After 12 days they cannot find it. Lost luggage department at Florence Airport provided us with email address and phone number. All our emails are bouncing back.,,,,,
" We took 3 flights with Aegean and would not recommend them to anyone. Had 3 issues: 1. They overbooked our flight and bumped many people. We bought our flight 3 months ahead, but checked in about 18 hours before our flight (they allow check-in up to 24 hours ahead). We were issued a “standby” ticket without any seats. When we got to the gate, we were told we may or may not get onto the flight and if we didn’t then we would have to wait 4 hours for the late night flight, or try again in the morning. Lots of other people in the same situation. We were never issued boarding passes but we kept following up with the person at the ticket counter until they gave us passes, it seems like due to our persistence and nothing systematic. Luckily we got on that flight, but others didn’t. Nowhere in the policy does it say that whether or not you get on the flight is related to your check-in time. If you take Aegean, check in right away and be persistent about asking for seats! 2. They apply a checked bag policy at will. We were sitting near the gate. The gate attendants approached us and asked to weigh our bags. Our bags, which fit easily into any overhead bin (including previous Aegean flights) were found to be slightly overweight (apparently 9kgs are allowed, ours were about 10kgs). We asked if we could move 1kg into our purse / backpack. They said no, they need to check the two bags, and by the way they are charging us 40Euro per bag. This was for a 45 min flight from an island to Athens. We had no choice and were forced to pay. Also, there was no consistency in the way this rule was applied. We saw plenty of other people with carry-ons larger than ours allowed on the plane and there was plenty of space in the overhead bins. 3. Every flight we were on was late. Two of three were late by over 45 mins. We didn’t have any connections, but I imagine many connecting flights were missed. And, this didn’t happen to us, but it’s worth noting that when we landed in Athens, there were about 30 people waiting at the lost baggage desk. Most of them looked very angry. I asked one person what happened, and apparently an entire flight did not have their bags transferred at a connection. So not only will they force you to check your carry-on and then pay for a checked bag, they might lose it too. All-in-all, this is a pretty bad track record for 3 short island hop flights.",,,,,
"  Passengers of  delayed Aegean Airlines flight 01.07.2023 stuck in Santorini, would like to thank the employee of the Aegean Airlines company from Thessaloniki, Markati, for her non-formal attitude, patience and professionalism! This combination of qualities is rare in our modern life. We wholeheartedly thank this wonderful girl and in her person your company, which helped us in a difficult situation.",,,,,
"  Boarding in Munich was a rush, however business class passengers did receive a welcome drink - Greek sparkling wine or water. The lunch had several options and there was a choice between 2 red and white Greek wines. The food was not bad at all. Decent information about the flight was given. FA were courteous and helpful. One of the better business products in Europe for sure. Only luggage was not quite delivered as ""priority"" despite labelled.",,,,,
  The baggage came with 1 hour delay and broken. Since then over a month has passed and I have not yet been refunded or received new baggage. On the telephone they do nothing except saying it is summer and it is normal to delay. Definitely not the company it used to be. Low cost company with premium company's prices.,,,,,
" The have option of buying tickets with unlimited ticket changes yet, the charge you same amount to change flight date as if was a new ticket. Furthermore the don’t accept to use a credit voucher for it, and they don’t give the money back! Worst service ever experienced!",,,,,
" Booked over 9 months in advance and opted for comfortflex fare, which included baggage, onboard wifi access and upfront seat selection. We chose seats right at the front of the economy cabin at time of booking, allowing party to sit together (we were all on same booking). Aircraft was advertised as a new A321NEO with free wifi. However after checking in online, aircraft had changed and subsequently seats were changed, splitting up the party. Flight itself was comfortable with decent leg room and free food/drinks, though quality was lacklustre. Crew were absent in any form of engagement on board, appearing distant.",,,,,
"  I arrived in Athens the 20th of June from Johannesburg / Addis Ababa on Ethiopian Airlines, connecting on Aegean Airlines from Cairo to Athens and my baggage did not arrive with me. When I went to report the loss there was no one at the counter and a person had to be phoned to come. My holiday in Greece is nearly over and my baggage has still not been located after 11 days. The customer care phone line is never answered. ",,,,,
  They made us wait at the gate for boarding for more than an hour. No explanation that there was a delay or no explanation why we weren’t boarding the plane.  Rude and unhelpful staff in Malaga. We paid extra to get seats together with my partner but they changed our seats to separate rows a week before the flight. No one helped us to sit together even though we paid to choose seats next to each other. ,,,,,
"  My wife and I flew Aegean Airlines for the first time June 7, 2023. These were two short flights consisting of Sophia, Bulgaria to Athens and Athens to Larnaca, Cyprus. Both flights were exceptional. The flights were smooth and the seats were comfortable. The cabin service was outstanding. We received a snack (more of a light meal) on each flight, and both were delicious. The first flight included a small sandwich roll with sliced chicken and cheese; the second flight included a pasta salad with tuna and dressing. We enjoyed every bite! As we were leaving the plane in Larnaca I commented to the cabin staff at the exit of the plane that Aegean Airlines was now my new favorite airline. And it is. I opted to give the airline a rating of 9 instead of 10 due to two items: both flights were short. Had the flights been longer (more of a test of the airline service), I would have given the maximum rating. Also, Aegean's website is not as intuitive as most others I've used. All in all a great airline: comfortable, affordable, and frankly, just a pleasure to fly.",,,,,
"  I did win upgrade challenge and I travelled Business Class though the airport does not offer Business Lounge. In the internet you will find information that Rhodes Diagoras Airport has two lounges but that is not right any more. With the new managment Lounges were closed. There was priority boarding, even though we were boarded on a bus. Crew was friendly and plane was in a good condition. We were boarded but we had a 20 minutes delay on departure due to Athens Traffic Controlers. In flight service was good and the copilot explained the route with details. We landed and parked in Athens on remote location but was a priority bus service for the Business passengers.",,,,,
" The airline overbooked the flight and told me that I did not have a seat in the plane. They wasted one day of my European tour. In addition, I had to see my parents in Athens and me not flying created significant problems to our family trip. La compagnia aerea ha sovrevenduto il volo e mi ha detto che non avevo un posto sull'aereo. Hanno sprecato un giorno del mio tour europeo. Inoltre, dovevo incontrare i miei genitori ad Atene e il fatto di non poter volare ha creato problemi significativi al nostro viaggio familiare.",,,,,
"  Check-in uneventful. Boarding a zoo with a rude employee denying me boarding, claiming some zone story.  Upon boarding I found a number of passengers that were probably the right 'zone' since they were seated in the rear already. An old ATR POS that Aegean must likely keep to connect some small islands that cannot accommodate jets. Why they would use these consistently for the third largest Greek island is unclear to me. Once seated in 15C and having put my backpack above, I see the flight attendant pushing it to make space for someone's big suitcase. When I objected, she pulled it down and told me in the rudest way to put it under the seat in front of me. Said attendant did not wear a name tag.",,,,,
"  Delay due to aircraft controllers. There was 1 hour delay due to late arrival of the airplane. Plane was an A320ceo on a good condition. Fully booked flight on economy, only one person on business. Crew was friendly and helpful moving luggage to the bins. No IFE only drop down screens where you can watch the flight path. Inflight service was consisted of ham or vegetable sandwich and a digestive bar with alcoholic drink/beer/beverage.",,,,,
"  Aegean Airlines will remain always my first choice and my favorite airline. The best Airline in Europe without any doubt. Cabin crew are so helpful, patient and supportive. Please keep up the excellent work and I hope that Aegean will make long haul flights soon.",,,,,
"  Aegean Airlines Economy Class LHR-ATH (and back). Aegean have kept up the high standards and are the best airline flying from the UK to Greece. Two rounds of drinks, a snack and a meal comparable to the pre-Covid catering level. This is far above any other airline's offering on this route. The inflight magazine provides detailed guides to places in Greece and I was able to track the flight's progress via wi-fi. That said, I miss the overhead screens with the moving map! Friendly crew and comfortable leg room on the A321NEO, flights on time or ahead of schedule both legs. ",,,,,
" This was my first time flying with Aegean, and my experience was anything but pleasant. Starting from when I checked-in at the counter, I have an SA Gold member where I get 20kg of free luggage, but the staff there says I have to pay another 45 Eur even though it should be free, and I explained that I have SA Gold and it should be free because I had a return ticket and I got 20kg free but the staff didn't care but tore the baggage tag in front of me and told me to go to the ticket agent at the airport, luckily the agent helped me a little bit to help me input manually, even though my status was still valid instead will be extended until next year. The second problem was when I was about to board in Athens, when it was my turn they stopped me and asked for a Moroccan visa or residence permit, I said my passport didn't need a visa to Morocco for up to 3 months and I even gave him a look at the Moroccan visa policy and he really didn't care. ",,,,,
"  The flight I was on for returning to Athens on 15 March was cancelled. We were informed this was due to weather. Passengers were told initially that the flight was delayed by 30 minutes, then another delay announcement just as passengers were getting emails informing of flight cancellation. The ground crew were poor at making sure there was clarity in their announcements. I went up to a staff member when most people who appeared to be Corfu residents had just gone home, and asked was there any hotel booking arrangements - ""No"", any hotel used in such circumstances, don't know, any cost max, don't know, what about meals, don't know. Reclaiming? - ""you have to go to Aegean office in Athens"". I spoke to a British Corfu resident who said most expensive hotel open was Corfu Palace. I chose to go somewhere with a little better location and not so expensive. I then found out from the lady that just after I left, she was told that anyone needing a hotel could go to the Corfu Palace and all meals etc were covered and no need to pay. So, overall great experience - really well done ground crew: vital information not provided on a timely basi. The later flight was full as the following day was a general strike in Greece - so 2 nights had to stay in Corfu. On return flight cabin crew tolfd me there was no issue with the weather, the aircraft had a fault that could not be fixed in Corfu. Aegean states 10 days to get back to passenger with complaint, it is now 19 days.  It is now 19 days and not a word from Aegean. This was my 3rd flight with Aegean. Their aircraft seem better than Sky Express their competitor, but my experience has really turned me off Aegean. ",,,,,
  A company that can be excellent but it started working like a cheap airline. Today for the first time they refused me to fly with my laptop and my small carry on. It did not matter that I am gold member. ,,,,,
"  Boarding was on time but with buses, welcome was friendly and tentative. We departed on time. There was WiFi available on the flight and is free on Business Class. In Flight Service was nice and tasty. Breakfast was nice and coffee and mastiha drink was good (they omitted the chocolate stick that they supposed to offer)",,,,,
"  The ground service was excellent. Onboard, the cabin was pretty spacious. The seats were kinda small, and the legroom was disappointing. The food was okay and the crew was very friendly. The Wi-fi and connectivity were excellent. Much respect for the airline.",,,,,
"  I’ve been traveling with Aegean many times since I live in Athens. I saw (me included) at least 10 pay checks for overweight of 8kg. After arguing with the ground representative, she literally told me not to board  this flight.  I would say Aegean is apparently better than low fare airlines but staff need training to be professional and more polite.",,,,,
"  
The after sales service is very disappointing. Today I spent 58 minutes on the telephone, waiting for a representative of Aegean to talk to me. I wanted to change my ticket and unfortunately I didn’t manage to do it – although I waited for such a long time.",,,,,
"  The cabin crew was very friendly and helpful. Also at the check-in everything went smoothly. The complimentary snack served was a very small slice of pizza, a sesame cookie and a drink. The seats were too small for me. I am 1.92 m, 84 kg, and for me it was very uncomfortable.",,,,,
"  We had made a FLEX (P) reservation, that we had to cancel due to pregnancy. The extra fee to cancel was 45€/ticket. This is something we already knew. What we didn't know is that the only way to cancel is through their Call Center. But in that case, which is actually the only possible case, there is an extra Call Center fee of 20€/ticket. At the same time, all the extra services you have purchased (even if there is no such clause in the ""Terms & Conditions"" we agreed on), meaning extra baggage, purchased selected seats etc, are turned into some kind of ""owed service"" valid for a year. Not a voucher valid for a year, the service must have been used, not purchased, in a year.  Finally, for some undetectable reason the refund had to take place, not automatically to the card we used to make the reservation, but we had to fill out another form, one for each ticket/passenger, with our bank account details, for the reimbursements to take place separately and via bank accounts. ",,,,,
"  Three passengers paid for extra legroom for both legs of our trip, Madrid - Athens and Athens - Larnaca. On the online system and on the reservations we were given extra legroom seats. At the ticket issuance at the airport these were changed to normal seats without any explanation. We were advised to write an email for refund. Wrote an email on June 19th 2022. Since then, wrote 4 more emails, phoned the airline 5 times and each time they told me they see the case and i am right but they cannot do anything about it because they are ticketing and customer service can only be contacted via email. Eight months later and no reply, no acknowledgement nor refund. Zero customer service, zero respect for client.",,,,,
  This company has scammed me severely on my last trip! I missed my connecting flight due to their delay and they rebooked everyone a ticket for free but not for me! I literally had to buy a new ticket and fly the next day. When I asked for a refund they stalled and never gave me a proper response! When I called customer service they told me to wait for customer service to review my request and they will respond in 7 days. Its been a month and nothing! They tried to say it was not their fault! This is an overpriced company that has no loyalty to its loyal clients! They try to mislead you treating you like an incompetent person! I will never fly with this airline again and I regret every penny I spent on them! Disgraceful!,,,,,
"  Good things:  usually rather new planes, depending on the route, usually good schedules, depending on the route. Super small space between seats at row 10. If you fly with children, the family will be placed automatically at the very end of the plane. The automatic sitting system separates families and assign them seats randomly in different rows. If you’re a frequent flyer with Aegean (Gold), forget about redeeming the upgrade vouchers if you fly with a child. They don’t want children in business. Aegean became extraordinarily expensive and mediocre since the pandemic. A shame, as they were quite good. Greek competitor Sky Express offers a good service for cheaper prices.",,,,,
"  At airport check-in 3 hours early I was told I was a standby passenger, despite booking months in advance and receiving a confirmation. I was told this was the policy of overbooking flights by 10%",,,,,
 Terrible service and handling of delayed and then cancelled flight. Understaffed to change boarding pass so we had to wait for hours in line. Very poor service.,,,,,
"  The first flight from Zurich to Athens was perfect & without any problems. However the second flight back was horrible and unorganized. Everything started when the gate opened & the boarding started.  They started to weight luggage and created a huge queue. I had a hand luggage, which was taken by them, because the haven't had anymore space in the airplane. My Father had a hand luggage too, but they didn't take his with them. When we arrived in front of the airplane with the bus, they started to check, which luggage had a tag on it, so they can take it with them.  In the airplane they were organizing the luggage above our heads & trying to make more space. However my Father's luggage was too much, so I had to go in front of the Airplane to give it to them. They had to take it with them and store it with the other ones under us. The plane was almost 30 Minutes late.  Never flying with them again.",,,,,
" Best Airline in Europe, professional cabin crew, smiley and helpful. Receiving updates about my flight all the time. The thing that might really need an improvement is the FQT program (Miles + Bonus) , they must be more flexible in transferring and receiving points from other Airlines.",,,,,
"  An experience that was neither good or bad until we tried to order water for our 2 year old. We ordered it, was asked to wait while the cabin crew was giving out hot food. After 20min we asked again and we were asked to wait. After another 20min, she started to cry uncontrollably, and we walked up to the crew (who was still busy giving out hot meal) that we really needed to give our child some water. When we finally got it, it was impossible to stop our girl from crying even when she got the water (well, most parents would understand that it was too late and the damage has already been done). So after calming her down (which took another 10-15min) she started to drink and became happy again. It was a bad experience for everyone, our 2 year old, us as her parents and all other passengers. A situation that could easily have been avoided, which would have been nice as flying with kids often means stress. Why couldn’t a person in the crew just stop for 1minute and help out? They didn’t even seemed bothered or at least a bit guilty when we explained that we couldn’t continue waiting because a 2 year old doesn’t understand that.",,,,,
" Although my flight was not delayed or canceled, I had a horrible experience. My luggage was damaged and I have submitted my complaint immediately. I have also documented everything with photos and requested a refund, but I only received confirmation that my complaint was recorded and since then, the company keeps ignoring my e-mails. Also, I got charged extra 40 euros for having an additional piece of luggage only when departing my destination and not on the other three flights (I had one stop at Athens). I am very disappointed with Aegean, so I do not recommend it to others because you will not get any support if something goes wrong.",,,,,
" Great airline! I fly regularly with Aegean Airlines, and it is always my number one choice. Especially the new planes are really nice, and the service on board is good too. The food is really not that bad, especially in business class. However, Economy is great as well. There are some nice touches with Aegean, like how they inform you when your flight is delayed. They email you, and you get a notification in the app. About the app, it works really good. One of the best airline apps I have tried so far! I don't have any complaints. Even after dozens of flights, no problems at all!",,,,,
"  Worst baggage experience ever. My bag was delayed at my connection in Athens on 9th August 2022 and Aegean has not responded to my request for first need expense, multiple attempts to reach them via email, and when I called the automated line said ""We do not have the resources to handle your request"" The worst part is I paid extra to check my bag.",,,,,
" Larnaca to Athens. I fly Aegean twice weekly almost every single week of the year. And I could say that 90% of the times their flights are delayed, specially the ones towards the end of the day. And it is not due to the overall mess that happened this past summer I'm so many European airpors. I can understand that delays pile up along the day but, knowing that this happens, they should review their schedules. Or try to catch up during the flight. The excuse is most times the same, the ridiculous ""late arrival of the aircraft"" (thank you!). Their app is also faulty lately (you call then, show them, and still don't accept it, things like not being able to check in, wrong pricing information, no incoming messages with flight delays, etc. Also, when they change planes and they cannot relocate you in a pay seat, you have to call them to get a refund! What they don't miss is to send a a silly survey upon landing asking about the quality of the service on board (""forcing"" you to chose an area of improvement!), while not asking for the end-to-end experience (from reservation, check in, baggage drop, boarding, disembarkation, luggage). They deserve some competition, they've simply got worse in service, unfortunately for those of us hooked to them.",,,,,
" Santorini to Athens. We had a very bad experience with Aegean Airlines. I bought two tickets and by right have combined baggage of 46kgs - however, when we dropped off our baggage, the staff told us Aegean don't combine baggage and charged us for excessive baggage charges although our actual bags combined only 43kgs. Also they dont accept one of our hand carry suitcase as well which have been travelled through so many airlines like Qatar and Swiss with no issues and charge us another baggage charges. Unless you want to be ripped off by this airlines otherwise I highly unrecommend Aegean because they will find all their ways to rip you.",,,,,
"  Corfu to Skopje via Athens. On August 4, 2022, my husband and I were traveling from Corfu, Greece on Aegean 285 to Skopje, North Macedonia on Aegean 984 operated by Olympic. Upon arrival in Skopje we were informed our luggage had been lost. We filed a lost baggage report at the Skopje airport. Once in Skopje all we had was the clothes on our backs. We spent the first two days of our vacation milling around an unknown city trying to find clothing and personal items and dealing with Aegean Airlines dysfunctional bureaucracy. On August 10, 2022, we returned home to the States empty handed and no word from Aegean regarding our lost luggage. Our calls and emails went unanswered. 10 days later we finally received our luggage that was come how found in Austria. We filed a reimbursement claim for initial expenses accrued in Skopje, for personal items and clothing replacement. Once again no word from Aegean. I repeated this process 3 times to no avail. Aegean airlines is run by sociopaths. They pretend nothing happened on their watch and choose to ignore any problems that happen on their airline. Trust me when I say I am not the only one affected by these grifters.",,,,,
"  
Aegean Airlines forced me to check my hand luggage too without additional fee. I checked it in the departure airport (Yerevan) and when I arrived at my destination airport (Hamburg) I got a notification from Aegean app that my hand luggage which they forced me to check as a 2nd piece of luggage is delayed. In  Hamburg Airport I could not find the responsible person for Aegean Airlines who will help mein this situation. ",,,,,
  They delayed our departing flight so we missed the flight to our final destination. They then booked us a new flight the next day at 7 am but in order to make the flight we had to take a bus at 5 am. For the inconvenience they provided a complimentary food voucher to use in Athens. When I tried using the voucher the funds were not applied. The cashier told me to go speak with an Aegean Airline employee. I then went to speak with an Aegean Airline help desk employee and due to our language barrier she did not understand what I was telling her so I never got the funds and had to buy my own meal.,,,,,
"  I recently had 2 flights with Aegean, both of which were not bad. RHO to ATH and ATH to AMS.  On the 2nd flight, I did see an attendant walking around the airport waiting room looking at bags, but she never weighed or measured anything. Both times the planes were delayed, though in their defense, most of the time I've flown in Europe pre and post pandemic, flights are delayed. The flight attendants were nice on both flights - always smiles and always helping. They never seemed to be unhappy, and some of the best I've encountered. I was impressed that they served a light meal and a beverage on my 3.5 hour flight and beer or wine didn't cost anything. Tui on the other hand, for the same length of flight, charged for food and/or drink and the leg room was much smaller, though their TUI allows 10kgs of carry-on luggage v. 8kgs for Aegean. I'd rather have the luggage allowance higher than the light meal and drink. The major thing that was scary was that almost everyone had left the airport in Athens before my moms luggage came off.",,,,,
"  The best airline in Europe, professional cabin crew, comfortable seats and excellent service. It was a pleasure to fly with you. Keep up the good work and wishing you all the success.",,,,,
  For a 3.45 hour Helsinki to Athens flight we got served a sandwich and the flight attendants passed only once for drinks. The airline has delays particularly at flights after the morning.,,,,,
"  Very early morning departure from Tbilisi with a crew that already worked through the night. The male purser, during the preflight information, informed transfer passengers to check luggage procedures in Athens in the inflight magazine - we did it and found out that connecting in Athens from Non-Schengen to Schengen means you have to pick up your luggage, take it through customs and check it in again. With the official 1:05h connecting time it sounded sporty. A biscuit, yogurt, and drinks were served as breakfast, then crew then went behind the curtains and did not show up again until the final approach to Athens. During the descent, they asked the passengers to put the garbage including cups with liquids into the seat pockets. Delayed by 40 minutes we landed in Athens. During taxiing, the purser advised transit passengers to rush to their gates. We made our connection by running and thanks to no traffic at the border guards. Our luggage arrived nine and twelve days later following a lengthy search, no support from Aegean Airlines, no answer to any call or any mail.",,,,,
"  Athens to Beirut on an A321. Business class seat is the same as in Economy, hard and rather uncomfortable. Meal was good for a 90 min flight, both in quality and quantity, though I find the pasta with chicken combination weird. No champagne available, only sparkling wine, but good offer of beverages and Greek liquors. Crew young, well-groomed, with some members being somehow snobbish. No WiFi and no entertainment. Will not fly again such a product in Business. On the other side, the brand new Aegean business class at Athens airport for extra-Schenghen flights is quite impressive, in terms of decor, ambiance and food / drinks selection: well done Aegean.",,,,,
"  We are both Star Alliance Gold status holders. We booked a full price Economy class Lufthansa tkt from MRS to Mykonos via MUC & ATH, at a price where seat selection is guaranteed. MRS-MUC-ATH with LH, ATH-JMK flight was an Aegean flight. After purchasing, seats reservation on ATH-JMK flight was not allowed. We wrote and call Aegean, no answer. 48 hours before that specific flight Aegean automatically booked 2 separate seats in the last row. We were allowed to change those seat, paying 6 Euros. This is so petty, that it is ridiculous.",,,,,
"  We booked a full price Economy class ticket from Lufthansa, at a price where seat selection is guaranteed. ATH-MUC flight was an Aegean flight. After purchasing, seats reservation on ATH-MUC flight was not allowed. We wrote and call Aegean, no answer. 48 hours before that specific flight Aegean automatically booked 2 separate seats in the back of the aircraft. We were allowed to change those seat, paying 12 Euros. ",,,,,
  Aegean exceeded my expectations. Didn't expected a snack and few drinks service on a few hours flight. I asked one extra beer when we started our descending and the crew handed out one with a smile. Way more better than other European airlines. I really hope they will earn five star airline status.,,,,,
"  I showed them my ticket to board on the plane. They thought my suitcase was big, then weighed it, and also found my bagpack too big. They never showed me the number shown on the weight scale, or informed me about why my bagpack was considered too big. Instead, they were rude. After me insisting on knowing how many kilos my suitcase was, they told me it was 9 kilos (instead of 8!), for which I had to pay 50 euros more.  I feel that economy class passengers are treated with no respect in the airport, and Aegean attempts to take more money from them, making their life difficult in their airport. I would not recommend flying with Aegean. A sandwich and a cup of coffee on the airplane is not worthy of such bad customer service.",,,,,
"  Smooth check- in procedure at a very busy Athens Airport. Polite and efficient staff on hand to assist. Boarded a clean and shiny A321 Neo, greeted by smiling and courteous crew. Full flight, on time departure, usual high standard of onboard service. Good and clear PA announcements from cockpit in perfect English. Toilets were very clean. Landed early, bags arrived on belt without any issue. Thanks Aegean, great flight and highly recommended.",,,,,
"  Lost my luggage 3 days ago, no call from Aegean or airport. Holiday ruined. We had to re-buy all our clothes again as they made us check in even our cabin luggage.",,,,,
"  Lost my bag, no support or help from Aegean, trying to blame Gold Air. Gold Air cannot be reached either by phone or email. Aegean refuses to change return ticket to fly back to Crete early, only with extra charge can this be done. This trip is a complete waste of time.  Food / Snack served on the 45 min flight a drink and Pringles. ",,,,,
"  After an extremely inappropriate delay of the flight, the boarding procedure was unbearably slowly conducted by the airline employees. Extensive waiting for the bus transport from gate to the aircraft and then 20 minutes of waiting in the aircraft for no reason .",,,,,
"  Worst experience I’ve ever had flying. Lost bags on the flight from Athens to Rome. It’s been about a week now and we still have no luggage. It’s cost us money, time and stress and Aegean don’t reply to emails or answer phones to update us. ",,,,,
"  Athens Airport was extremely busy when I arrived. Proceeded to the Aegean Airlines check-in area which was manned by helpful staff and carried out self check-in. Met by polite staff at bag drop. Queues were starting to form at some counters, the one next to me was being held up by some irritating passengers who were questioning the baggage allowance for hand luggage. The Aegean website clearly states the weight permitted as do the various signs at check-in, yet some people pay no attention to this and continue to be rude and aggressive to check-in staff who are only doing their job, politely and professionally.  Boarded on time, full flight. Politely greeted at door by cabin crew. Professional service on-board. Landed early. Clear announcements from cockpit. Great flight. Recommended.",,,,,
"  Just flew in from Istanbul to Athens on the way to London. The first leg was fine, however this review is about flight A3608 on July 8th 2022 from Athens to London. It seems to have become a habit by airlines to force hand luggage to be checked in which is an annoyance for anyone who is familiar with the wait this results in at Heathrow. The crew are nice and friendly and apart from a minor delay, the flight was on time. I specifically asked for a window seat and was placed in position 28A. It’s only when I got on that I realized this seat is on the emergency door and this aircraft type does not support a window on this position. ",,,,,
"  To include an extra hand luggage I had to pay +20% on the fare. Checking in I weighed my luggage, it was 1.2kg above. I was forced to give it to the hold and not allowed to remove a jumper from my luggage to my backpack. A checked in luggage would have been cheaper than the upgrade I paid for.  This is my worst travel experience in 2022.",,,,,
"  For two extra kilos you made me pay 40e. ‌I was flying Aegean Air from Thessaloniki to Athens today (flight A3 111) with economy/light ticket, which includes only one cabin bag of 8kilos. I did forget about this, and came to the airport with my cabin bag and a laptop backpack. After weighting my cabin bag, Aegean stuff said it was 10 kilos, I was allowed 8kg and only one luggage. I said I can put the backpack in the cabin bag, but they refused as this would make it heavier. They clearly didn't want to help me and actually told to to hurry up and pay the fine or I would miss the flight, as people were boarding. I later thought that I could have easily taken out my heavy jacket and trainers - I was wearing flip flops, and make my cabin bag much lighter, so with my laptop it would be a bit over 8 kilos. Very, very disappointing Aegean Air.",,,,,
"  Aegean check-in at Istanbul Airport are the only desks with approachable staff who serve you with a smile. This airport is too big and very impersonal. Expensive Duty Free Shops and eateries Boarded on time, nice, clean aircraft. Politely greeted at door. Slightly delayed departure, short flight, only 50 minutes, drinks and snack served by professional crew. Landed on time. No issues. ",,,,,
  Aegean lost my bag 7 days ago and it is impossible to contact them. The world tracer is not updated and while they are supposed to contact me after 5 days there is no contact. The bag is an expensive piece of sports equipment and I have no idea if I will see it again. I waited over 50 minutes on their central baggage phone number without answer. I emailed them numerous times and no reply.,,,,,
"  Early morning flight due to flight schedule changes (three months in advance notice). Flight JMK-ATH left early and arrived nearly 20 minutes ahead of schedule in Athens. Despite a nearly 2 hour connection, one of our priority tagged bags did not make it (together with 30 other bags) on the flight from ATH to CPH. It is quite impressive that Gold Air handling missed a whole trolley of bags. Flight to CPH was fine. Good service and quite nice new seats in Business Class (empty middle seat). Breakfast OK, not fantastic. Service was good and attentive as always with this airline. Bag trouble took 1 hour to register in CPH. Friendly service but took a while. One of our bags arrived on the wrong bag belt after us asking where it was. The other bag was left in Athens. Bag arrived following day late at night on a strange bag delivery service as I had to come down to the delivery truck and visually point at my bag. Strange and not very professional. Bottom line, poor to lose a priority bag in a two hour connection. And, by the way, I do not like the way this airline randomly pick on economy people to weigh their bags. In my opinion is either all or none. Not some poor people who has to face a huge cost because of one kg overweight hand luggage. What is really the point of upsetting people. The airline should know that if they write max 5kg hand luggage people will bring 10, if they write 8, they will bring 12. Build this in to the business model!",,,,,
"  Horrible. Flight delayed more than 1 hour. After luckily making my connection right on time, upon arriving I find that my checked-in luggage has been lost. I filed a complaint, they said my luggage would be delivered to me in 1 or 2 days. Two days have passed and I have not received any feedback. My address for delivery in their website is incorrect (I chose to send to my temporary address, but they are showing that they are sending to my permanent address, which is in another country). Their websites are broken so you cannot update any information successfully. I called multiple times, one call took more than 35 minutes and nothing was resolved. Other calls I have waited for 20 minutes and then the call was dropped without having the chance to talk to anyone. ",,,,,
"  My employer was stuck for 2 1/2 hours in the Toronto Pearson Airport because of a delayed Air Canada flight headed to Athens, Greece last evening (June 16th, 2022) due to understaffing of airport personnel and consequently would miss his Athens (Aegean Airlines) connection to Mykonos on the other end. I call Aegean's customer service in Athens and spoke with a lovely gentleman, Avgoustis. Avgoustis was calm, reassuring, patient and found me the best possible solution to get my employer on a connecting flight to his final destination (Mykonos) in the shortest time possible. He kept me calm! I really hope that someone will recognize this gentlemen's exemplary customer service.",,,,,
" Flight from Athens to Mykonos was great, every part. Our flight from Santorini to Athens - not so good. The agent working at check-in at the Santorini airport was rude, angry and classless. We had only a carry on that we checked once at Athens. We didn't buy anything and actually left our beach towels at the hotel. Upon checking in we were told that one of our carry on luggage was 2 kilos overweight and the other carry on was a half kilo over weight. We tried to explain those original luggage did not incur any problems before. We were charged an extra 50 euros. The way she said it was very rude, no negotiating and very aggressive. I guess this is how they treat you when you are trapped on an island. Definitely recommend the ferry or another airline.",,,,,
" We booked our flights for December 2021. As covid hit harder, we decided to plan for another month, so we changed our flights for May 2022. Due personal reasons, we can't fly to Greece. I contacted the customer service several times, waiting in the line over 15 minutes, 15 minutes which I need to pay, the second call they told me they cannot help as I booked the flight somewhere else. So I contacted the initial website and got the information, they do not have the booking, as I changed the date on the airline website. Long story short, we lost 400€. I would really recommend to book at bigger airlines, at least you will get help if needed. So disappointing!",,,,,
  Excellent service by the cabin crew and the ground crew. They went1 beyond their responsibilities and helped me do the check in for another flight to EU country and communicate with another airport. They are kind and truly helpful! I have been using their service for several years now and I never had a negative experience with them.,,,,,
"  Had to reschedule my flight to Athens from London. Called the Aegean Customer Service line to do this. Lines were busy but didn't wait long. Call answered by very polite agent. I explained my situation about requiring my flight to be rescheduled and my onward connection within Greece. Agent did this and explained the process in excellent English. I paid the extra and booking was complete, no fuss, no bother. Flight was outstanding from start to finish, as usual. These are difficult times for everyone and we need a degree of flexibility. I am still shocked to see how rude and aggressive some passengers are to airline staff when travelling . Aegean is still my first choice to and from Greece, no airline is perfect but they are better than most.",,,,,
" I just wanted to share my terrible experience (and it is the same for a lot of people!) with Aegean Airlines! In my case, after booking a flight to Athens, they first cancelled my flight and, instead of reimbursing the ticket, they offered me a voucher. I've reluctantly accepted, considering that my girlfriend and I go very often to Greece because we love it and we have dear friends there. The voucher, due to the Covid emergency still not allowing us to use it, expired. When I asked a reimbursement, as per point 9 of their Terms & Conditions policy, they have deliberately ignored all the emails I have sent. They have lost 2 very good clients, considering that we had always flown with Aegean and that we keep going to Greece as often as we can. Now I will rather swim to Greece, than using Aegean again! Worst airline ever!",,,,,
"  Couple hours after purchase through Expedia I realized I had the date one day earlier than what I planned. Called to find a solution. Originally I did not want to cancel the flight, only needed to change it. Aegean policies have no flexibility for the regular changes which would happen. It does not seem Aegean shows any interest in offering a useful service to customers but only have the customer stuck with a charge which they receive no services for because flexibility is not part of business. Aegean's website claims to have 24/7 customer service - I have been on the phone waiting for a rep for about 30 minutes and no answer to the extended that phone was automatically disconnected.",,,,,
"  The space for legs cannot be considered acceptable for business class, with my height 1.90 cm I cannot fit my knees straight. It is beyond my understanding why Aegean presenting it as business class.",,,,,
"  I bought tickets for flights and hotel however, when I needed to cancel in good time the airline refused to refund me. The level of English was broken at best and there was no attempt on the part of the airline to understand and rectify the issue. The complaints process was long and difficult to use. I tried to use the discount voucher codes for Covid-19 tests that the Aegean website was offering however, there were issues with using the codes so there was no way of using discount. In an attempt to escalate the issue I used the service Resolver, which is normally used as a last resort but this wasn't helpful as the airline simply did not engage in any way. ",,,,,
"  I booked a ComfortFlex ticket for a midday flight from Athens to Thessaloniki on April 3rd. We had a change in our plans and I had to change my ticket to an evening flight. This particular fare allows changes for the same day with no fee and seats were available on the new flight so I logged into my reservation and changed the flight successfully.  I then tried to reserve a window seat on the new flight but noticed that only middle seats were available for free. This seemed strange since the flight was not sold out and ComfortFlex tickets allow free seating in the entire aircraft except for the exit row seats, where a charge applies. I then noticed that the only window or aisle seats available on my new flight were those at the exit row and those would involve an extra 9 Euro charge. As I'm about to proceed with the payment of this 9 Euro charge, my boyfriend informs me he will be joining me on the same flight. We book a new ticket for him and when we reach the seat map on his reservation, we can see plenty window and aisle seats available for free. We decide to call the Aegean call center to inquire why our reservations show different seats maps even though we've both purchased ComfortFlex tickets and we're traveling on the same flight. Their response was that it must be a systemic error and if we wanted, we could wait until going to the airport and request a window or an aisle seat there. If anyone of you has ever called Aegean for similar matters, you'll know that 9 out of 10 times, it's always the ""system"". It's evident that they're manipulating the availability of their seat maps to force you to pay extra fees even when you've purchased their highest economy class fare.  We paid the 9 Euro fee this time but from our main choice, they will become our last choice until they get their act together. And of course it came as no surprise to read so many other reviews here from other passengers complaining about similar situations. I'm attaching a picture of the two seat maps and I leave you to draw your own conclusions. The bookable seats are those in blue and in my seatmap, window and aisle seats are not available.",,,,,
"  Check-in procedure carried out professionally by extremely polite and communicative staff. Hand luggage was checked to ensure compliance with Aegean 's terms and conditions which it did. Breezed through Passport control despite the terminal being quite busy. Ample and polite staff kept queues short. Aegean Airlines terminal was spotlessly clean with ample duty free shopping available. Amazing authentic Greek food products like Greek baklava, feta and extra virgin olive oils were on promotion. Had to buy some. Boarding was orderly and we were greeted at aircraft door by immaculately dressed cabin crew. I am always impressed by how professional Aegean Airlines cabin crew are. They put Turkish Airlines crews to shame. On time departure with on board service of drinks and meal again served in a very professional and polite manner with a smile. Duty free trolley appeared after the meal service. Smooth flight, landed 20 minutes early. Excellent service from start to finish. Thoroughly recommended.",,,,,
" Both me and my wife are frequent business travelers and Gold Miles & Bonus members. Aegean Airlines started off as a promising, refreshing presence in the Greek market but it is clear that they are in a steep decline. We've experienced such poor customer service in the last several years on a number of occasions. Refunds that took 18 months and countless calls and e-mails to process (for flights that Aegean Airlines canceled). Missed connections due to flight delays where they failed to assist us to reach our destination or arrange overnight accommodation for us. We were asked to cover the expenses on our own and then submit the receipts to receive compensation. We've taken trips where we were asked to pay service fees to change Comfort Flex and Business Class tickets. These two categories are their most unrestrictive fares and allow same day changes without a penalty, yet on a number of occasions, when their website failed to successfully change our tickets, we were asked to pay a service fee to proceed with the change. I could go on and on with a number of other disappointing practices but all in all, it seems that they've adopted policies and restrictions that we only find present with the so called low-cost carriers. All while charging full service carrier regular fares. Until they re-adjust their policies to a more customer service oriented level, we will certainly avoid flying with them in the future. Enough is enough.",,,,,
"  I was traveling to Stockholm, always with Aegean which for me is the top airline in Europe. It is not only service, the friendly and professional staff but also, one of the few airlines that offer meals included in the ticket price. And the meals are really great. In this flight a big surprise was the desert offered on the menu of the flight, Greeks call it ""pasteli"" which is a traditional sweet with honey and sesame seeds. The one of the flight, Navarino Icons Pasteli, was exceptional!!! It was so tasty, fresh and I was surprised that looking for the brand I discovered that it is a product of Costa Navarino which is a luxury sustainable destination and resorts and the opposite of an industrial product.

"  LHR - ATH. Check-in was polite, professional and quick. Great selection of Duty-free shops and eateries in T2. Boarding was orderly and greeted at aircraft door by polite and immaculately dressed cabin crew. On time departure, clean aircraft inside and outside. Seats are comfortable with adequate legroom. Drinks service and snack served. Attentive crew. Toilets at rear of plane in Economy were clean. Smooth flight, landed early. Good trip, recommended.",,,,,
"  Staff are friendly and the overall experience from ground and cabin crew is very pleasant. Families were given priority when flying from Athens and luggage is usually checked in at no cost (if within size/weight limit). Seats are fairly tight, as expected, but overall pretty comfortable. Planes are new with USB charging on board and if you are lucky, a basic on-board wi-fi streaming service. Food quality is really bad, a tiny cold sandwich, served in a very environmentally-unfriendly card box. Drinks choice is OK. The part that lets this airline down is cleanliness. I expect a spotless cabin, only to find carpets are dirty, which is surprising for a brand new plane, seats have no headrest cover and toilets the worst I have ever seen on a plane.",,,,,
"  Boarding was done with bus to remote location. Cabin staff were just professional but not friendly. In flight service (breakfast) was in a cardboard box consisting of a cream and a sweet in plastic. There was a option of sandwiches, but they ran out. With the high priced ticket a shame to provide such inflight service. No warm food was offered. The flight was on time. IFE was done through your mobile telephone and there was very limited viewing options.",,,,,
  My wife and I booked a trip on Expedia. The rate for economy class seemed acceptable although it restricted us to a single carry-on of no more than 8 kilos. At the airport duty free we bought some items and when tried to board we were told that we had to pay 60 extra euros for the duty free bag. When we tried to put the contents into our carry-on they told us that we would still have to pay the 60 euros since our bags would be above the 8 kilos allowed. In the end we had to pay or lose our flight. ,,,,,
"  Aegean Airlines are the best airline in Europe. They keep on doing an amazing job. Website and application are very easy to access, cabin crew are professional. New aircrafts and clean cabin. Best value for money.",,,,,
"  
I had to change flights in Athens. We were landing at 15.30 and my boarding time to the other flight was at 15.30! I asked if someone would take us to the other gate and they told me there would be a ""transit ambassador"". I started looking but no ambassador. They were sending me for PLF control which I already had in Prague and no one knew where was this ambassador. I had to pass again from security control. It was very stressful and inconvenient.",,,,,
"  I dislike the fact that on too many arrivals this airline has not approached passenger walkways, and is choosing the bus as if we are still in the 50s. This was the case on our flight from Larnaca to Athens on 10/11 arriving with more than an hour delay, which was not announced until we were on board, and in Athens the bus like sardines despite the pandemic. The very expensive fare is not justified by a tiny sandwich they give you in flight, and you are given a choice of a fee seat only at the two last rows right next to the toilet, that is is such a place they give you 6 only free seats. You pay very dearly for the ticket, pay extra for luggage or anything over 8 kg, pay extra for a seat or take the seat next to the toilet. The plane is perfect, inflight service excellent, pilots top class, yet some things are really frustrating.",,,,,
"  I was unable to check in for some reason and I was given a seat in the middle. I tried to change it but after check-in at Oslo for the SAS flight, check-in kiosk couldn’t change it so I called Aegean. After 3 calls to the customer service line I was instructed it is fixed and I should check-in on the app paying for my seat change. At boarding in Stockholm I was faced to pay my seat change.",,,,,
"  My daughter and I flew from London to Athens yesterday. We both had a backpack for our laptops, which we went to London with from Athens, but on the way back we have to pay 100 pounds for our backpacks. I am very upset and the rude Heathrow staff behavior with customers at the gate, and I will never recommend this airline.",,,,,
" On this trip they used a A320neo which is noticeably quieter then the regular one. The all female cabin staff was acting friendly and efficiently. We received a lunchbox consisting of a sandwich and a tasty honey-sesame cookie. A limited range of drinks was served as well. They use the airfi on-board WiFi system for games, news, real-time map etc. The biggest letdown are the seats, with an incredibly tight pitch. Even the ones at Wizz Air have more legroom.",,,,,
"  Nothing to complain about. Stuttgart to Heraklion/Crete on Sept. 21st and return on Oct. 1st. We booked Aegean for the convenient flight times and their decent luggage policy in the Eco ComfortFlex Fare. Both flights were 100% on time. Check-in procedures were quick and efficient. Due to the chaotic conditions at Heraklion Airport Aegeans punctuality and efficiency cannot be appreciated enough. Flight was ok. The crew was not overly motivated but helpful and friendly. There was a free snack and beverage service, which was nothing special but more than other airlines offer. Interior of plane was a little run down but seat comfort and leg space were ok. Overall the Eco Comfort Flex Fare is a very good value for money. Too bad, Aegean doesn't offer a Business Class on their HER flights, at least not out of STR.",,,,,
  They canceled my flight and did not notify me. I had to look the flight up myself to find out. Then they would only refund with a voucher that they won't send for 2 weeks and that expires in 12 months. So I will have already left Europe by the time I get it and will probably never be able to use it. I couldn't find a new flight within the same day because it was such short notice which screwed up plans for accommodation that I can't get refunded and so on. The stress and money they have cost me is crazy.,,,,,
"  Accurate departure and arrival, Excellent check in process via the mobile app, clean plane. The new baggage policy has turned Aegean into what i would consider a low-cost carrier. Booking a Flex ticket in order to carry your luggage along with a laptop bag or a purse onboard is unacceptable.  Aegean did not use to be like that. It was always a bit more expensive but the passenger was treated well, with good cabin service and with the ability to have a carry-on and a personal item onboard without having to pay anything extra.",,,,,
"  My daughter bought this one way flight for me and paid Euro 140 with just cabin luggage. The ground staff representative asked me to change my flight to a flight that was leaving 7 hours later, without any consideration about the amount of money we had spent on this flight or what I was going to be doing for 7 hours at Corfu airport. My daughter had bought me this flight which was two times more expensive than the later one as I do not like to return home when it is dark. When I declined to change, she asked to weigh my cabin luggage. She then told me I was 2 kilos over the limit and I start unpacking my case, otherwise I would have to pay another Euro 35. I eventually left the check in area with my clothes over my arms and eventually repacked my case. While boarding, the same lady reprimanded me because I had repacked my case.  Low cost airlines offer better service and much better value for money.",,,,,
"  My wife had a very small hand bag, we had to pay for that 60 euros, so I gave the lady cash, and she answered that they don t accept cash, so i told her what if i don’t have a credit card! She answered me, Sir you can complain at Aegean airline or airport in a rude way. When we arrived to our destination, they broke our luggage. ",,,,,
"  Zero arrangements for connection flights. My Aegean flight came 30 mins late and I only had a 45 mins connection window to catch my flight to Thessaloniki with Olympic Air. No one made sure they waited for us, the boarding gate was across the airport so I was running for 15 mins. Had all my papers, covid pass and PFL checked before departure, yet they checked passports with another security check in control despite not leaving the airport. At the end my hand luggage was taken at the plane baggage section because there was no space upstairs. Think about connection flights!",,,,,
"  I think the theoretical boarding procedures they have in place for covid are really good. Fill the plane from back to front and avoid too many people being on top of each other. The problem is that they do not to execute the boarding procedures the way they say they will and that leads to a lot of confusion. They used to have in flight meals in Economy, now all they have is a snack.  At the end of the flight they squeezed passengers onto a bus.",,,,,
" Larnaca to London Heathrow via Athens. Efficient, friendly service. Check-in at Larnaca was efficient and quick and all docs were checked with professionalism. Bags tagged all the way to Heathrow and boarding passes were given for both flights. Perfect on-board service, as always, for both flights. Would highly recommend this airline and would definitely choose them as my first choice when booking even if this involves a transfer at Athens International Airport. We’ll done Aegean Airlines.",,,,,
  I am travelling with Aegean Airlines every year from London to Greece and me with my kids are having great time on the flight. We recently came back from Athens Greece on 01.09 and we are very pleased with the crew and the service. I am missing the before COVID-19 period meals but the new kolatsio version is very good quality and tasty. I have been a member of Aegean Airlines for a long time now and even though I have tried Easyjet and Ryanair I won't change Aegean Airlines with anything.,,,,,
"  We flew Aer Lingus last summer Seattle to Dublin to Edinburgh and then back Edinburg to Dublin to Seattle. Our plane left quite late from Seattle with no explanation and we ended up getting into Dublin several hours late missing our connecting flight. No one there to help, an hour bouncing around to different Aer Lingus staff in the arrival terminal w/o one person helping us. We finally ended up outside back at check-in in a long line of rebooking passengers who were told we wouldn’t make the next Edinburgh flight as it was booked, last one out that day. The staff were unwilling to book us on Ryan Air which EU regulations say should happen as they had plenty of seats. A supervisor took pity on me and somehow got me on the last flight but we arrived in Edinburgh 5 hours or more late outside of the EU regulations with no food or drink offered or available. Aer Lingus has denied the EU regulation payment saying it’s not covered since  unforeseen circumstances on first rejection and then it was a us domestic originated flight so it isn’t covered (not true since it started in Dublin and arrived late into the States). On flight to Dublin they lost my wife’s suitcase and it didn’t get to us until the 2nd to last day in Ireland, over 72 hours when it’s considered a lost bag, we filed a claim, and not once has anyone acknowledged this reimbursement owed for the modest clothing she had to buy. I’ve been on hold with their customer service for hours, sent many inquiries, and tried to escalate this but no there cares about us. Worst lack of care for us we’ve seen from an airline.",,,,,
"  Please beware that the entertainment system on the St MacDara aircraft Dublin to Orlando is not operational. What that means is that most of the seat screens are not working so even though you have paid a lot of money for your seat you had better have downloaded your own movies/music and games on your own equipment prior to the flight. Also the WIFI is not working. Aer Lingus state that it is a 'compatibility issue' but its actually that the plane is old and most of the equipment such as the controllers for the screens have been broken and not repaired. They are also serving freshly brewed iced coffee just before you land, even if you want hot coffee. All in all its service with a shrug.",,,,,
"  Just flown Alicante to Dublin. Very efficient, pleasant staff at check in and on board the aircraft. Even had a yarn with the pilot who did a super soft landing. Highly recommended.",,,,,
" Depart: delayed by more than an hour, no explanation. In flight: 90 minute flight, paid for extra leg room, not worth it, last off the plane. Shuttle from end of airport to terminal to get bags. Deplaning: They neglected to inform any of us (who waited for an hour) that they had to leave 40+ bags in Southampton, due to overweight on the plane. I was the first bag to be checked in at Southampton and have not yet received my luggage! It's been 3 days, and all I get on the tracer app is, still looking.",,,,,
"  They're so inefficient with their check in even airport security and marshalls were joking about it. The queue to get checked in was so long as the staff never pitched. The long queue disrupted other airlines from checking their customers through. I will avoid this airline. I booked British Airways, but they seem to codeshare with  Aer Lingus.",,,,,
"  Delays leaving Dublin caused us to miss our connection and they did nothing to help book our hotel room in Heathrow for the night. They dodged paying compensation and made it as difficult as possible to file for a reimbursement of out of pocket expenses. Eventually claimed they sent us a check but months on, no check and they refuse to respond to our case claim anymore. Their “refund” call center doesn’t actually exist so they can simply ignore your online claims. I suspect we will be left footing the bill at this stage. Feel helpless, Mad as hell and will never fly with them again.",,,,,
"  We arrived over 2 hours before our flight was to depart from Dublin to Philadelphia and checked with ticket assistance when we saw a line in ticketing that was very long. The ticketing assistant told us to get in line. No mention of 75 minute flight closing time or that we should go to a ""special flight closing counter"" if the 75 minutes was close to expiring before we got to ticketing counter. We get to ticketing counter and they tell us flight closed, too late. Then when we go back to ticketing assistance counter, they blame us for ""not listening to the announcement"" that the Philadelphia flight was closing. We never heard such and announcement and asked the ticketing assistant why they did not tell us about all of this when we initially approached them and questioned them. They continued to blame us. Very poorly managed airline based on my experience, and the attitude of the employees who dealt with us was not a reflection of poor management.",,,,,
  The staff at Dublin airport are very rude and unprofessional. I was 3 hours early for my flight from Dublin to New York. I needed help at the Dublin airport. I asked 5 different Aer Lingus staff for help and was told 5 different answers. I even spoke to a supervisor who was the worst of all the staff. In the end I missed my flight and had to reschedule. For Dublin to be the home hub for this airline they were the worst people to deal with. The hub in New York at JFK airport was must nicer and professional. The WIFI did not work in the plane and only half of the screens worked. The plane staff even made an announcement about the screens freezing up while watching a movie. The lady in the seat in front of us had a broken seat. It only reclined.,,,,,
"  Aer Lingus is a sad excuse for an airline. Not a single of our four flights was on time. We were almost twelve hours late to Paris and had to sit in the Dublin airport all day. There were no employees available to discuss flight details or compensation for delays. The flights also either said they had Wi-Fi but didn’t, or just said flat out they don’t have Wi-Fi. Disastrous airline and I will never fly with them again. Steer clear.",,,,,
"  Easily one of the worst airlines I have traveled with. First, the connecting flight did not wait for us even if the origin flight arrived at Dublin on time. Ticket purchased at Aer Lingus, so they have the responsibility to await other connecting passengers as all other major airlines do. Second, and surprisingly the most irritating they never answer the phone of respond to emails. I waited for close to an hour on the phone and 1-1/2 hours waiting for an agent on Chat.",,,,,
"  Got on the plane and it is so old that there is no USB or outlets. We are burning up because they have no air flow, and we were informed the entertain doesn’t work. It is a 7hr flight. This is outrageous for the price I paid for this ticket. This airline is a joke and I would never recommend it to anyone. First and last time I will fly this airline. ",,,,,
"  We booked our flight 7 months out and checked in 4 hours early. We were involuntarily denied boarding, causing us to lose 2 days of our vacation. They violated federal policy twice by not including a verbal or written reason as to why we were selected for IDB, and by not asking for volunteers to take a later flight in exchange for compensation. We were thankfully refunded the maximum amount for our flights ($1350 each). However, one of the checks bounced, causing us to incur an additional fee from the bank. Customer service hung up on us after an entire hour on hold and then did not call back. We were last told to open a ticket for the bounced check.  We will not be flying with Aer Lingus again.",,,,,
"  Cork to Dubrovnik return. Comfortable aircraft , Cork based crews very chatty and engaging. Legroom good. Cheapest fare allows 10kg checked luggage. This means very few suitcases on board. No fighting for locker space so no mad rush for boarding. Very positive experience at a very good price.",,,,,
 If you have to book with them and have no other option please consider buying air tags and if you are traveling with someone make sure you mix the clothing and belongings so that you don’t end up having to buy an entire new closet for your trip. They lost our luggage and it’s been 4 days now without our stuff and the customer service is non existent. I think that maybe a group of mice could better figure out how to locate a lost bag better than these humans. I will never fly with them again and will warn others in the NYC area to do the same.,,,,,
"  Had booked back 2021 to fly from Manchester to New York via Dublin in September of that year, Aer Lingus then cancelled the flight from Manchester to Dublin and we changed to the direct service that was due to start in November 2021 which was also later cancelled. We opted for a refund and after hundreds of emails and phone calls I have still not had a refund 18 months later. This airline is useless and will never fly with them again!",,,,,
" A lovely flight from Dublin to San Francisco - could not fault it. Things went rapidly downhill after that, and Aer Lingus complete lack of regard for paying customers became all to apparent. Our luggage went missing and Aer Lingus have been rude and unhelpful. As a customer I am so disappointed in the customer service provided by my national airline. As an Irish person I'm ashamed and embarrassed to think that other people may be subjected to this treatment. This is not the image I want my national airline to be portraying of Ireland and Irish people. We have a short six day holiday in San Diego; Day 1 is now gone because of Aer Lingus complete and total lack of regard and concern for paying customers. We paid €2808.50 for our flights (2 people) and it is disgusting to think that once they got our money they no longer care. Shame on you Aer Lingus.",,,,,
" WORSE THAN SPIRIT AIRLINES! Lost luggage nightmare! This is easily the worst and least helpful airline I’ve ever dealt with. I’d even recommend Spirit Airlines over Aer Lingus. They lost our bags on our recent trip and have no desire to help us get them back. Their customer service is a joke and they are incapable of providing any answers to help us understand when we can expect the bags. Besides this nightmare we’ve experienced, the planes are also small and uncomfortable. Will never fly with them again!",,,,,
" Our outbound flight was excellent with no issues and on 10 June for our return flight, I have one big issue and some niggles. For the whole flight, the cabin crew locked off one of the two available toilets. There was nothing wrong with it as the cabin and flight crew used it. Keeping a toilet exclusively for crew use is, in my view, unacceptable. The seat on the A330 is comfortable and I had the best 4 hours of continuous sleep I have ever had in the air. The food offering was, for me, poor except for the snack just after take off with the first drink service. It comprised a pack of five mini, savoury biscuits and a little tub of onion chutney to dip, both of which were delicious and very different from the nuts or pretzels others offer. On the outbound flight, we were offered the traditional juice or champagne prior to take off but no attempt was made to offer this on the inbound flight. The Asian-style beef at dinner had little of the Orient about it. I didn't try the dessert or either of the starters. IFE was available but very limited choice compared to many other carriers. Finally the complimentary wi-fi was somehow not available on this leg but you could pay. Outbound no problem a voucher was given shortly after boarding. Okay, quite a bit of whinging there, and apart from the very comfortable seat the only other positive was that despite delayed take off on both legs the plane arrive on time or a little early. I would certainly use them again for this route though as too few Manchester to the USA options are available.",,,,,
"  We booked a ten-day tour of Ireland thru Trafalgar Tours. The tour started 19 May 2023. We wanted to arrive early and see some of Dublin before the tour started so we booked an Aer Lingus flight from Orlando Florida to Dublin on the 17th of May. Our flight was due to depart at 8:30 PM and arrive in Dublin at 9:30 AM on the 18th of May. (Aer Lingus Flt. 120). We were told that the incoming equipment had been delayed and that we would depart at 9:30 PM. The incoming aircraft arrived shortly after 9 PM followed by a fire truck! We were told we would depart at 10;30 then, 11:30. this went on till 2 AM on the 18th. They said the flight was canceled, but we would be boarded in the morning as soon as the aircraft was repaired. Imagine 300 people scrambling to get their checked luggage and make their way to the check in desk to get a hotel voucher (we found out that they booked the hotel rooms at 9:00 PM that night), madness. We got to the hotel at 4:30 AM. We had three hours sleep and returned to the airport to see if our plane had been repaired, it hadn't. we were told we would be boarding Aer Lingus flight 34 for Manchester, England at 5:45 PM. We arrived in Manchester at 7:20 AM on the 19th of May. Our connecting flight (Aer Lingus 3327) to Dublin did not leave till 5:45 PM that night. We arrived in Dublin at 6:40 PM. We arrived 33 hours late. We had paid for a hotel room in Dublin for the night of the 18 that we didn't get to use, and we missed the complete first day of our tour. We filed a claim with Aer Lingus for $ 600 each for me and my wife per EU rules. We also asked for $220 for the hotel room we had paid for, $174 for meals and $800 for the first day of the tour that we missed out on. They have offered us $147 in total compensation although they are responsible for our losses. Never again will I fly Aer Lingus or say a good word about them. ",,,,,
"  Had a connecting flight from Heathrow to Shannon. Flight was suddenly cancelled. I was told very rudely, you have 2 options, sit in the airport for 17 hours until tomorrow or move to Dublin. But you will then have to have a 3 hour bus journey to Shannon. What is so frustrating is this is a very regular occurrence, receive no apologies, then was made sit on the runway for 2+ hours without being able to purchase so much as a chocolate bar. I have been running from gate to gate like a headless chicken and have has no time to stop for some food. I'm starving. ""No we cannot give you anything to eat/buy until we are in the air"". Waited ages for flight then bus to take off, rushed again, no toilet on bus or time to run to shop. No where to charge phone to arrange a lift. 3 hour cold bus journey starved after that. Awful experience, will never fly Aer Lingus again. Obvious lies all the time, excuses for everything that were not even good ones. We got a free plastic glass of water from a 2 litre bottle and at no stage when people complained did anyone say 'Sorry'. Ryanair has become the new Aer Lingus and Aer Lingus the new Ryanair. Lots of extras costs to be as a result. Aer Lingus will regularly cancel Heathrow to Shannon on a Monday if the flight is not full to save them some $. Unethical!",,,,,
" I booked round-trip from Boston (BOS) to Amsterdam (AMS). Then I paid $500 extra to change to round-trip from Hartford (BDL) to Amsterdam (AMS) when Aer Lingus started flying out of BDL. Six hours before the flight, Aer Lingus cancelled BDL and had me fly out of BOS. I asked them to change the return flight to BOS since my car would be parked there. They said that would be another upcharge, which I refused. I requested a refund of the $500 since they didn't deliver what I paid for. They rejected the request. So on top of the $500, I had to buy an Amtrak ticket from Hartford to Boston to get my car and pay for two extra days of parking at BOS. This is unacceptable. I urge anyone considering Aer Lingus to reconsider.",,,,,
"  On May 6 flight , I was flying in Business Class from Dublin to Boston. I had expected an exceptional level of service, comfort, and attention to detail. Regrettably, my experience fell far short of these expectations. when I received my meal onboard. To my dismay, I discovered a disturbing bug in one of the dishes. This discovery was not only highly unappetizing but also raised serious concerns about the hygiene and quality control standards. Such a glaring oversight in food preparation is simply unacceptable. What adds insult to injury is the complete lack of acknowledgment or apology from any representative of the airline. I was astounded by the disregard for customer satisfaction and the absence of any effort to rectify the situation or offer an explanation. The absence of an apology or any form of follow-up after such a distressing incident further compounds my disappointment.",,,,,
  Aer Lingus – Flight E1 178 on 4th June 2023. Dublin to London Heathrow. I shall start this review by firstly referring to the online booking experience. While the website is clear the added on fees such as seat selection and charges for baggage leave a bitter taste. I was livid to see that some passengers brought aboard bags larger than the one I paid to have in the hold based on the online information. Boarding was not efficient as there was no priority boarding for needy categories of passengers. Moreover the person checking & scanning the boarding pass did not even make eye contact and was using her mobile phone with one hand while scanning boarding passes with the other! This is unprofessional and something I have not seen before! Most of the cabin crew had a low profile with the exception of one very hard working lady who went above and beyond to assist and elderly couple. It was nice that some announcements were made in the Irish language as well as in English. The flight arrived ahead of schedule and disembarkation was efficient but again cabin crew other than the same hard working lady were invisible. The flight was operated by an A320 neo. This was ideal for such a short but very busy flight. The captain made clear announcements and safety was taken seriously. I would use Aer Lingus again but have concerns over the baggage fees.,,,,,
"  They didn’t put our golf clubs on our flight on both legs to and from Edinburgh to Dublin. They lied and said they were on the flights when asked. We watched them unload them. We took photos of this. We had AirTags in our bags and were able to track. They constantly lied to us about them looking for them. They make you fill out a report and you never hear from them again. Through a third party we were able to have our clubs picked up, without the airline even knowing. The customer service staff is ignorant and unhelpful. Very unprofessional all the way the senior person who just couldn’t be bothered and didn’t care. There were 8 of us and this happened to 7 of 8. Worst flying experience. Everyone we spoke to in Edinburgh said this was a regular occurrence with this airline. If we didn’t have the AirTags we would have been out our clubs. Find another option, this airline is horrible.",,,,,
"  My flight was delayed by 3 hours which made me miss my bus home which is 4 hours from Dublin. I then had to wait an hour after arriving in Dublin to get another bus that wasn’t even going to my home, it stopped 40 mins away so I had to arrange for someone to pick me up from there. I’m very disappointed with there service and have never been as stressed in my life and I didn’t think I was going to make it home.",,,,,
"  Our flight from Chicago to Dublin was delayed and our connecting flight to Zürich did not wait in Dublin. No big deal, we thought. Usually airlines would route us to the final destination without much fuss. Not the case with aer Lingus. Aer Lingus doesn’t have relationship with most major airlines. So you are presented with very limited choices. Our best case alternative routing presented was over 12 hours of delay from the original time. We even asked for a direct connection the next day but they didn’t have flights to Zürich on Sunday. So the next flight was two days away. We took the alternate route they provided. We were not provided any compensation or voucher.  We had to take the checked bags out at Ireland and go through immigration to get the rebooking done and had to check in afresh again. They provided boarding passes only until Amsterdam and not to the final destination Zürich. The baggage tag was also to Amsterdam. I raised concern over that. The agent said we should collect our bags again at Amsterdam and recheck and collect boarding passes at Amsterdam at KLM counter. The flight to Amsterdam was delayed by two hours. When we reached Amsterdam, we had to go through immigration and collect the bags again. We did that and when we went to check in the bags, we were told that their system doesn’t show that we paid for the bags and we have to pay again. We paid for 30 kg check in bags. Due to Aer Lingus's fault, we now have to pay again for the baggage (55 euro) and an excess baggage fee of 75 euro. Not only that, we had to visit six different counters to get this issue resolved. We spent well over four hours going from counter to counter with kids and bags. Klm staff asked us to pay them and seek reimbursement from aer lingus. When we contacted aer Lingus via them WhatsApp business account, they asked to register a case at their website and provided a link. After filling out all the details meticulously, the form crashes with a server error. Wow. Please don’t ruin your trip / vacation flying Aer Lingus.",,,,,
 Amazing customer service at the gate. I missed my original flight though my own error and the gentleman at the gate couldn’t have been nicer put me on the next flight to London with no hesitation and no judgement. I’m so appreciative to have been treated this way. Thank you Aer Lingus.,,,,,
" There are lots of choices when booking a flight. We happened to be celebrating a milestone wedding anniversary and booked a trip to Italy. The flight itself was fine. We arrived at the airport in Naples and were the only passengers on a flight of 300+ people to be standing at the baggage carousel when it shut down because all the bags had been picked up by the passengers except for us. Our bags were missing. So now we head over to the missing baggage window and fill out a missing baggage claim form. This is Sunday morning. We make our way to the hotel with the clothes on our back for a week long stay to celebrate our anniversary not sure where our luggage is. We are tired. We have been on two flights for 10 hours. We wake up the next morning and put on the same clothes we arrived in to get breakfast. Never mind that there are new outfits in our luggage that we purchased for this trip that are floating around somewhere. After calling Aer Lingus multiple times and being told our luggage is out for delivery, we logged on to their missing baggage website only to learn our luggage has not been located yet in spite of Aer Lingus agents lying and telling us on the phone our bags were on the way. Was this so we wouldn’t go out and purchase necessary items to change into to keep Aer Lingus lost baggage costs lower. We are now in our 3rd full day in Italy and Aer Lingus still stands by their claim that one bag is out for delivery, when the truth of the matter is they can’t specify where it is en route. This saga will probably continue for us long after we depart Italy in two days. To add insult to injury, Aer Lingus cannot tell us what is acceptable and necessary that we can purchase while we wait hopelessly for our luggage. Talk about being given the run around, reading from a computer screen that the bags are in route, escalating our calls to supervisors who only read the same script on a screen. My Advice to Everyone out there - DO NOT BOOK YOUR FLIGHT through Aer Lingus if you value the peace of mind that you are entrusting a company that values it’s customers and will make a sincere effort to correct an error in a timely and honest manner. Let’s face it, a lot of people are like us, we don’t travel all the time, we spent thousands of hard earned dollars, and to be in Europe for going on four days in the same skivvies we arrived in should not be tolerated by customers - so book with another airlines if you value peace of mind.",,,,,
"  I travel a lot for my job and have lived in several different countries and so regularly use many different airlines. Although Aer Lingus are not always perfect, in my opinion they are one of the better and more reliable airlines today. They are reasonably quick to refund when there has been a problem, reasonably fair in their assessments of grievances and generally better at professional communication than most. There's definitely room for improvement but overall I am happy to spend money with them as I have seen they care about the quality of their services when it matters the most, i.e. when there has been a problem.",,,,,
" Welcome to post covid travel! I can accept many things, especially because of covid. Airline flights cancelled, lack of full staff, the list goes on. So, for this summer expect a whole lot of cancelled flights. So lets look at what a cancelled flight looks like in this post covid era. First off you'll get a message that your flight is delayed. Ok, so we'll just hang out in the club lounge a little longer, have a bite to eat, a beverage and just relax. Maybe an hour later check on how the flight is going and oh my! The gate looks like a scene at a border crossing: Its humid, its hot, there are people laying on the ground, babies are crying. Real hell on earth...well back to club for me! Then 3 hours after our plane should have left they announce flight cancelled. I go the gate and again see a scene of human misery, that's passengers I'm talking about, not Aer Lingus employees, they've booked it for the exits and gone home (probably high-fiving each other with, 'great job today!'). So we are left to our own devices and somehow all wonder to check-in like zombies out of a horror film (and the babies are still crying). An hour passes (it's now 10pm and we have been at the airport since 3pm) and word filters down that our luggage is in baggage claim. Off we all go to pick up our luggage (picture zombies trudging with a suitcase (and I wonder how those zombies with babies picked up their luggage?) Again we are at check-in with no Aer Lingus staff. Finally at 11pm someone who is not Aer Lingus starts to sort through this misery and give us direction, hotel, call this number, etc. And now for the zinger, not once, not at any time did any Aer Lingus staff show any humanity for the 3 or 6 month old babies that were crying. I saw one mother patiently comforting her baby in stoic solitude, showing her character and instilling in her baby what true character is. This is what I saw and learned that night and what I saw from Aer Lingus? Not a damn thing!",,,,,
"  The security is amazing so quick it's almost worth the way you are treated on the flight, almost. Going from Dublin to LA we had a engine fault. Totally get it - it could happen to any good airline. We were trapped on the flight for one and a half hours before air conditioning could be turned on. Then we were freezing. After a two hour delay we were off. This was my first long haul with Aer Lingus post covid - a lot has changed. The bar came round once! What you are not told is there is no complementary wine with your meal just a tiny tiny cup of water. Luckily for me I ordered two drinks to see me through to past dinner. Food was OK - as soon as dinner was served the cabin staff disappeared and I mean disappeared! I found them all about 5 hours later literally hiding in the galley. I asked if I could purchase a bottle of water ( gone are the heady days when someone quietly came round the cabin asking if anyone required water on an 11 hour flight) no we have no bottles I was told. Some one took pity on me and gave me one from business class. As a walked back to my seat clutching my bottle other travellers gasped with cracked lips ""where did you get that"" that was going to LA on way back exactly the same issues only I told the line to buy water before boarding. We landed in Dublin to something described as a breakfast burrito (it was hell on earth) and to add insult to injury we were not even offered a coffee! Shame on you Aer Lingus, shoddy shoddy customer service - in case anyone is wondering it was a £750 ticket. This is definitely what I would call a no frills air line. Funnily enough I was offered a coffee to purchase from Dublin to Edinburgh. Too little too late absolutely shameful.",,,,,
" Never again. Paid megabucks for business class. No welcome on board drinks, e.g. champagne, orange etc offered. No drinks trolley coming round offering drinks throughout the flight, the only drink I was offered was with my meal. No duty free offered. No food came around until about one hour into the flight, it seemed as though they heated one meal at a time. Slow is an understatement. On our outward flight, of the 30 seats in business class, there were only 13 seats occupied, yet I still could not have the meal I wanted as they had run out? Food was bland and uninteresting. The staff seemed to be just doing as little as possible, not interested, not friendly at all to anyone really. Got a code for free wifi in Business Class, it did not work, so no free wifi. At JFK when we were boarding our flight, which was delayed by an hour and forty minutes, a ground crew member attempted to open the barrier to allow economy class ticket holders with buggy/prams to board before anyone else did, until another staff member told her that business class passengers should be boarding first. Apart from the roomy and comfortable seat, I felt like I was in economy. Note to Aer Lingus....take some lessons from Virgin and BA, they are not brilliant but miles better compared to the joke that is Aer Lingus. I will not be flying in business or any other seats with them ever again.",,,,,
"  They have gone downhill since Covid. I used to be happy with Aer Lingus pre Covid. But now this airline is a complete waste of money and time. The plane was dirty. The tables have not been cleaned, butter and coke was sticking on it. There was no pocket on the seat. But the biggest failure were the staff at Dublin airport. The ground crew was rude beyond imagination.  The woman at the gate yelled at me and others, ripped my boarding pass out of my hand and was really disrespectful. That was not what I was paying for. The other staff were fairly disinterested in service of any kind. Felt like they have a miserable job so anyone else should have to suffer. This was the last time for me traveling with Aer Lingus. There is no value traveling Aer Lingus anymore and I strongly recommend choosing a proper airline. Sorry Aer Lingus, but it is in your hands.",,,,,
" Complete dog water brain of an airline. Unprofessional ground AND air staff. User interface on airline app is shocking. Completely unprofessional behaviour of staff. Treat customers like cattle on the airplane. Literally had a stewardess push her whole body behind me saying 'please quickly take your seat' when there was clearly other passengers in front of me. Ground staff - on top of being completely incompetent, always have a 'I hate my job and my life so everyone else has to be miserable too' type attitude. Completely disregard customer personal space and complete rudeness in general. DO NOT RECOMMEND",,,,,
" Crew in the airport were not helpful at all, I arrived to the airport 1h before my flight on 10/5/2023 because of an emergency, but the Aer Lingus boarding staff in Dublin airport terminal 2 didn’t understand or try to help even though I had no bag to check in, basically all I had to do is to head directly to the plane, but he didn't want that to happen. I had to pay 300GBP extra to buy a new ticket and the new flight got delayed. Cabin crew and boarding team are not professional at all, rude and not helpful. Not recommend at all and you can‘t compare them with any other respected air lines like Emirates or Qatar.",,,,,
"  Just flown Dublin to Alicante. Couldn't find a fault. Very pleasant staff on ground and in the air, but I still think hold luggage costs are are pure theft.",,,,,
"  I use to recommend Are Lingus pre covid they had amazing customer service. After COVID they've gone so downhill that it is insane! I flew with them last summer our flights were an absolute mess! They rearranged our seats without our permission, contacted them and were told it was fixed back took hours but it was fine. Ended up being rearranged again again without our permission again had to call in and were told it was fixed. When we arrived in Dublin for our transfer one of the family members was put on a completely different flight at a completely different time. The staff in Dublin were rude, they said there was nothing they could do at the gate and we'd have to leave the gate and go to the main desk at the office. After waiting for almost 2hrs because two other non-related flights got cancelled and they only had two people working the desk we were told there was nothing they could do and they don't know why one person was switched even though we had our email confirmations and they could see all the previous flights made. I followed up with their customer service team because this was ridiculous after months they offer a mediocre voucher for our experience. It is been 7 months and I've yet to see this voucher. I've called multiple times and each time they say there's an open case but no supervisor is available to address it at the moment and they'll leave a note on the file.",,,,,
"  I am flying in May, but after dealing with the airline I have great doubts about it. First off the online booking is a joke because they do not update their fares so by the time (5 minutes) you try to pay...you are unable to. Then you try to do it via the phone and all you get are non native English speaking ""service reps"", who can not understand you and you can't understand them (FYI I flew as a second office on a regional so I know my diction is good). I am fully expecting the same on the flight.",,,,,
"  Very efficient, friendly. Only comment I would like to make is that the announcements by Cabin Crew were not clear. Each announcement was spoken too rapidly. As if there was a race on.! No sense of style. Just rush, rush, rush. Diction was very difficult to understand, particularly with male cabin crew on London /Shannon. Each word rushed into next. Just could not decipher what was being said. The spoken word can be beautiful, even if it is an instruction. A few seconds to pronounce what one is saying can make a difference I believe. ",,,,,
  cAircraft wouldn’t start at Gatwick resulting in a two hour delay and missing my connection to Orlando. I was then rerouted via JFK which was also 2hrs behind getting me into my hotel at 02:30 instead of 9pm. On the return trip from Orlando to Heathrow via Dublin again the flight was 2hrs late resulting in a missed connection again and a late arrival into LHR. I paid extra for legroom and window seating which I lost on two legs. When I asked about the seats they said send an email!! Their check in staff at Orlando spent more time on their cell phones than dealing with customers. Even though the lines were long they didn’t care. No value in this airline at all don’t waste your money.,,,,,
" Absolutely shocking service. If I ran my company the way they did, I’d be out of business. Our flight was due to leave at 18.05, they waited until 18.25 to say the flight was cancelled and couldn’t get us on another flight until the following day. We were then told to head back to baggage collection to collect our cases, and proceed to check-in to arrange the hotel. This would have been straightforward if they hadn’t made us wait 2.5 hours to get our bags back. We then had to make our way to the hotel, most of that was guess work, only to find out our so called food voucher wasn’t available for use in any of the hotel restaurants. They tried to palm us off with either fish or curry in a separate room and it wasn’t being served until after 21:30. Travelling with children, this really isn’t a fair deal. We were then informed we had been transferred onto the 06:30 flight the following morning, I mean come on, not eating until after 21:30 with children, then trying to sort cases etc and be up for 03:30 the following morning to make the flight, absolute joke! To make things even more hilarious, my friend was travelling on the Aer Lingus flight to Glasgow around the same time we were due to fly, they were 20 mins from landing and they turned back due to a technical fault. So travelling back 40 minutes was safer than the 20 mins to Glasgow!! Clearly they don’t want to have a plane stranded in Glasgow, as it would cost more than the inconvenience to the full flight of passengers.",,,,,
"  Scam airline. Announced 1 hour before departure that the airplane had a “technical” problem. Though clear to us that there weren’t enough passengers. Miraculously, enough seats available on the Boston flight 2 hours later - except for the very unlucky 8 people at the end of the line, who got a hotel voucher and big sorry. Basically they are canceling transatlantic flights and stuffing other flights. ",,,,,
"  I have used Aer Lingus for decades and my last 3 experiences has been extremely bad. Me and my wife flew back for a relatives funeral and upon or return Aer Lingus canceled our flight and changed our flight with out notifying us. I paid extra for a direct flight, almost double to be exact, and they forced me on a connecting flight to Hartford, Connecticut, and we had to get a bus from Hartford to Newark. I was told it was only going to take 2 hours and because it’s under a 3 hour delay they would not comp us on anything whatsoever. The supervisor at Dublin airport was not helpful, just had an attitude when I tried to explain or situation and would not give us any alternative flights. I will never fly Aer Lingus again they don’t care for customers.",,,,,
"  There was nothing wrong with the flight itself per-se - it took off and landed on time, generally calm. Terminal 2 security at Heathrow was calm, although amenities and shops quite poor - since Boots closed, you can't buy water anywhere for less than £2 which is extortionate. Boarding felt a bit early, but we didn't take off at departure time as it was quite slow - this was because there was only one gate agent checking in everyone including premium passengers and those requiring assistance, although automatic gates were used. Seats were above average comfortable for short-haul, on the way our was old-style so more padding and quite comfortable but on the way back was slimline but fine for an hours flight time - strangely the seat pocket in front had been sewn up so no where to store small belongings, which felt a tad low-cost despite the premium prices charged for this flight. Cabin-crew weren't especially warm and friendly and seemed rather unmotivated, they did pass through the cabin quickly offering the buy-on-board snacks and drinks but no menu was offered and it was almost like it was just a formality and seemed a bit surprised or put-out that some people actually wanted any like my neighbour in my seat. Buy-on-board products didn't look good quality from looking online, felt very expensive for what they were in comparison to other carriers. My biggest issue though is Aer Lingus charge quite a premium to fly with them against the only other carrier they compete with between the two cities, so they're not anywhere near cheap - yet it feels like a low-cost basic experience. I think even a complimentary snack and some water is the least the should offer as their sister airline BA now do in short-haul economy given the premium charge. I would fly with them again only if they were the only better option as on this route.",,,,,
"  Nothing to write home about. Seats were a bit cramped, food tasted bland, no free alcoholic beverages on my flight (which I had previously assumed was standard on trans Atlantic flights but maybe I am mistaken). FAs were helpful but firm, IFE options left some to be desired. We got these tickets for ~$400 less than the closest competitor however, so I suppose we definitely got what we paid for. Dublin airport transfer was painless and second leg (Dublin to Paris) was a short breeze.",,,,,
"  I pay GBP412 for 4 passengers - Heathrow to Belfast - this fare includes 63 pounds for extra legroom seats and 112 pounds for 25kg checked baggage x 4. Aer Lingus can no longer provide this service - they booked us onto a British Airways flight but on the 'cheap' seats - with hand baggage only, to the value of approximately GBP150 pounds for all 4 of us. There were checked baggage options available as I asked BA and it still would have only cost 215 pounds compared to the 412 I paid Aer Lingus. Now Aer Lingus reuse to refund me the extra legroom and checked baggage fees. I have to pay again to BA to have 25kg checked baggage x 4 and extra legroom seats are now not available. They take your money, can't provide a service, refuse a reasonable request for refunds, book you on a third of the price seats/flight and pocket my change. Their terms and conditions are the seats/tickets are non refundable - I understand this however my seats / tickets with Aer Lingus are non existent so how do these rubbish non refundable terms and conditions apply to a non existent service? As you can imagine - they can't or WON'T answer that. Their email to me said an alternative flight or refund - I requested the refund and of course was ignored. So unprofessional and unethical and such poor customer service! You should be ashamed of your greedy selves.",,,,,
"  From the moment we purchased tickets, we had the most shockingly bad customer service. Be aware: you can do nothing online, including book or change seats and must call Customer Service for everything. They do not respond to emails, customer service is outsourced to overseas Indian or Eastern European countries where some do not speak English well enough to answer your query. They always say you have to email but you never receive a response (this after 24 emails over 3 mths and no responses). We flew business and they ran out of food. They offered economy meals. Flight attendants clearly did not like their jobs. The food (when you did manage to get any) was horrible and it was next to impossible to get a second drink, even water. Finally, we arrived in SFO to hear my husband's name called - they put my bag on the flight from Dublin but not his. We were leaving and checked through from Paris. They promised it would arrive next day, next flight. 10 days later it is still listed as tracking and in Dublin. We phoned several times to be told it was still in Dublin as far as they could see. We went several times to the airport and checked Lost Luggage -also finally went a 3rd day to see the same flight coming in and found a helpful man on security who phoned around. He left to go to an 'office' and came out with our bag. Fully tagged. It is still listed as 'being tracked'. We have contacted Aer Lingus to advise this but still listed as being in Dublin. . This has been one of the most horrible airlines we have ever flown.",,,,,
"  Aer Lingus have lost my luggage, not once, not twice, but 3 times! All 3 times I have flown on them from Washington DC to Glasgow, they have lost my luggage while transiting Dublin. I arrived in Glasgow on Wednesday morning, and I still haven’t received my luggage today, 4 days later. I leave the UK on Thursday 1/12. Just ridiculous, when I call the number for missing bags, I got through to a woman who was completely unhelpful and vague as ever. She told that my bags were out for delivery and have been out for delivery for 24 hours now, and they still haven’t arrived. Aer Lingus are notorious for losing people’s luggage",,,,,
"  Lost my luggage, dishonest and ignored. Ruined a family Christmas in New York. You can see from other reviews, losing luggage has become a habit with this airline so you would have hoped that they would have a better way of dealing with it by now. Unfortunately, there is no help whatsoever and they couldn’t have cared less. We return to the UK tomorrow. Who knows if we will ever see our luggage again. Never fly with Aer Lingus.",,,,,
"  I travelled from Canada to Birmingham via Dublin. Worst worst customer service .At the airport we found all our luggage was lost, we were asked to file the missing luggage form, and was told we might get it the same day. No further instructions. Until today 2days after, I don't have my luggage. Calling airport, customer service no reply, line busy but never got through. Worst airport and airlines. I am pregnant and I have a 2 year old kid. My medication and my son they are all in the luggage. No clothes to wear, have to do some shopping on my own expense . I was not told anything if I can claim or whatever. I have travel insurance but was told by the officer at the airport no need to claim. I am traveling to another country tomorrow but still no luggage. This is so unprofessional. I wish I read reviews before booking with this airlines. Never travelling with them nor will I refer them. ",,,,,
  I was flying back to Raleigh from Spain on Aer Lingus with stops in Dublin and Boston. However when I got to Dublin Aer Lingus had a system failure so all their EU flights were canceled but they were still pushing out the flights to the US. My flight got delayed 3 times however we finally boarded but about 30-40 minutes after boarding and right when the air hostess were giving the safety instructions they got a call from the pilot and couple minutes later the Pilot announced that the flight couldn't take off because he would go over the amount of flying time he can legally complete. When the flight was canceled it was around 11 pm and they promised to give us a hotel and reimburse us for finding new flights. They did not find us new flights we had to find them ourselves and they didn't provide us with accommodations. I ended up sleeping on the floor of the airport over night and spent at least 30 hours in the airport because of this whole ordeal. To this day I still haven't received the refund or the reimbursement for finding a new flight and it is now 2.5 months later. I understand that they would have been understaffed and thrown off guard when the system crashed but no staff member that I talked to seemed like they wanted to help. I reached out to their customer service about rebooking my flight they didn't get back to me 2 days after I got back to the states about rebooking my flight.,,,,,
"  My experience with Aer Lingus was not very good. The airline was a step above a budget airline. Here's what was average the seats, the onboard service, and the entertainment options. The airline meals were tiny and hardly filled you up. The wifi did not work on any of our flights. However, it was upon arriving in Dublin that our problems began. We had a three hour delay due to ""weather"" despite the fact that the sun was shining and there was almost zero snow or ice on the ground. It took hours for them to de-ice the plane which is the airlines responsibility. The ground crew never told any of the passengers what was happening or how long we could expect to be delayed. The zero communication was very frustrating. The short flight to London had no complementary beverages of any sort despite the long delay. On our return flight to the U.S., in the Gatwick airport there was a single gate agent checking in 80+ passengers. We stood in line for almost an hour. Why Aer Lingus? We almost missed our flight despite arriving to the airport two hours early. The airline's apps and online website never worked and we were unable to check in before we arrived to the airport which meant we were confined to the very last row on the plane. Wouldn't fly them again unless it was super super cheap or there were no other options.",,,,,
" Could not check in, thanks to an aggressive, dismissive, I couldn’t care less about customers employee. This employee refused to make a small correction on my boarding pass that others have done before without any problem. She was aggressive, stated several times that it was not her job to help customers, she didn’t have time to waste and did not care. Missed my flight, my business meeting and had to buy another ticket from another company. Avoid at any cost!",,,,,
"  Just a general warning to avoid Aer Lingus at all costs. Their planes are very old, felt like I was in a 70’s film. That didn’t bother me at all but just thought I’d note that. The main problem was the constant delays. Sure there was a issue with ice when the plane was en route to Chicago so it got delayed which is understandable. However this delay was not made known to anyone on the flight and after the gate changing 3 times and 4 hours after the plane was supposed to take off did the counter staff arrive and make an announcement of the delay which would cause my partner and I to miss our connection on Aer Lingus as well to Portugal. I called customer service 4 times, waited on hold for a total of 3 hrs only to be hung up on all 4 times and told to call Alaska who we booked through, though each time Alaska told us Aer Lingus has to make the changes and Aer Lingus refused to make the changes when Alaska told us Aer Lingus had to do it. Ended up having to make the change in Dublin airport. Overall awful experience.",,,,,
" Flight was delayed multiple times, at first it was going hour to hour then two hours. Ticketing agent disappeared for hours with no one to ask about updates. All tracking information for the flight disappeared from all trackers leaving the entire passenger list to wonder what the hell was going on. We were told the delays were due to weather but planes have been coming and going from this airport over the last 6 hours I have been waiting to board this flight. Would be nice to provide an update at least hourly.",,,,,
" Flight got canceled, re routed with a long stop over. Luggage got misplaced, I was asked to report later. Uncomfortable seats with very small leg room and I’m not even a tall guy.",,,,,
"  They canceled the flight a day before departure, then refused to issue a refund, not once, but twice. Awful airline, avoid at all costs.",,,,,
"  Having had our fight cancelled from Shannon on the 19th Nov 2022, we flew from Dublin the following day. Aer Lingus were very good about the cancellation and looked after us well though communication was not great following the cancelled flight. The cabin crew served the most awful food I have ever had on a flight. The chicken meal I asked for was only lukewarm and since I didn't want to risk being ill on my holiday I decided not to eat it. Later they served coffee, I asked a cabin crew member for sugar and he completely ignored me, I assumed he didn't hear me and repeated my request, he immediately said I am dealing with something in a rude and aggressive manner, I was so embarrassed, even the people sitting next to me remarked on him. We flew back to Ireland on the 28th October on the 18.55 flight. We got a cereal bar and orange juice for breakfast, my husband asked for coffee following breakfast and was told that the captain said coffee was not to be served due to turbulence! We were certainly not advised about turbulence. We will never fly Aer Lingus again if we can possibly avoid it. Terrible. The cabin crew are just awful, rude and have complete disregard their captive customers!",,,,,
"  Atrocious. +6 hour delays. Left stranded in the connecting airport due to the delay, causing us to miss our connecting flight. No customer assistance in getting to our final destination. Had to book my own alternate flight on my own dime. Awful customer service. Still haven't gotten my money back 2 months after the flight, despite all the airline people telling me I would be fully reimbursed while I was stranded. The planes are old with broken infotainment systems. ",,,,,
"  Absolutely disgusted with this airline. The pilot allowed a group of drunk people on board - utterly ridiculous decision. After sitting around for 2-3 hours, the flight was cancelled, at 23.55. No staff available to provide help/support to customers. Alternative flight not offered. Earliest flight I could get was with Ryanair at £644! Lost a day's income. Aer Lingus offered EUR 87! Not nearly enough to compensate for loss of income/cost of flight, cost of taxi.",,,,,
"  Absolutely disgusting airline. If I ever had to use them again I would sooner not go on holiday. Food not good. Lack of snacks, only soft drinks included, no wine List goes on. That’s before I start on the delays.",,,,,
"  London to Dublin with Aer Lingus on July 09, 2022. Arrived in Dublin, no luggage to be found. Baggage area was utter chaos as dozens of people were searching for their luggage. Submitted online baggage claim forms as directed. No airline personnel around to assist anyone. Subsequently made clothing and personal item purchases....nothing extravagant, just enough to get through the week. Via e-mail was directed to screen shot receipts for reimbursement. Seven weeks later, reimbursed for less than half the amount and was informed via e-mail there was a minimum by law. Really? The amount was shameful, not to mention no reimbursement for lost items in luggage. It is now October 22, 2022. No further communication rom Aer Lingus electronically or by phone. I wrote a hand written letter to the airline customer vice president in Jericho, NY a month ago - no response, same to the V.P. in Dublin. No response. This, sadly, was the only overseas trip I have ever taken in my life and it was ruined. Aer Lingus simply doesn't give a damn about customers.",,,,,
"  I booked and purchased tickets for an Aer Lingus trip in October 2021. BOS-SNN-LHR June 15 22 Returning from Paris CDG-DUB-BOS on June 28 22. The outward flights were uneventful. usual 30min delay in Boston, poor quality food in coach. I liked the new A321NEO to Shannon much more comfortable than the old 757. However the return was hell. We arrived at the counter at CDG to total chaos after waiting in line for an hour we got to to an agent a contractor (Swissport?) she told us we didn't have a reservation so I gave her our number she then said the BOS flight is cancelled. But I pointed out that the previous customer is on the same flight and they got passes for both flights. She then said our reservations were cancelled by Aer Lingus and we would have to make our own arrangements to get home. I asked for the duty Manager who told me the same thing and suggested I call customer service. I made her call customer service and she got us on a BA to LHR and AA to BOS the next day. But No hotel or meals. I had to find a hotel on my own using a tablet on airport wifi. When we got back I submitted a claim for EU261 Compensation with Aer Lingus on July 1 Ref #8333779. I got an Ack for this the next day and have heard nothing since although I have inquired of status several times by Email. eventually I got thru to someone who said they are still working on the issue and to expect to hear soon - this was on Sept 30-still waiting. I have a Vacation home in Kirush Clare Ireland So i guess I will be using Delta or Icelandair in future. In conclusion you have to be crazy to fly this airline. They are definitely nothing like the old Aer Lingus I loved flying.",,,,,
"  Worst customer service ever, my food was disgusting and had to pay for drinks on transatlantic flight. Cabin crew were rude to me. Worst airlines ever",,,,,
  I couldn't believe there was only 1 working bathroom with over 150 passengers and also every flight was asked if I would like a beverage I said a coke and after she opened the can she asked for a 2.50 payment. I was under the impression that beverages were complimentary since I paid 1500$ for this flight. Terrible airline and service.,,,,,
"  Checked in both of us for our flight the next day via the app. No issues obtaining my husband's boarding pass, however for some reason mine was completely inaccessible both on the app and website, and the agents available via Chat on the Aer Lingus website may as well just be bots, given they clearly just copy/paste template excuses rather than actually making any means of an attempt to help customers. No semblance of an explanation or effort given to help, whatsoever. Now when we get to the airport in the morning we'll be forced to wait in the check-in line for absolutely no good reason in addition to all of the others. Way to punish a paying customer for your own site and mobile app's shortcomings, Aer Lingus customer service is trash.",,,,,
 Worst Airline I have ever traveled with. I travel extensively internationally and have seen it all. They left 45 minutes late due to baggage loading issues (no other explanation provided). Our connecting flight from Dublin to Edinburgh was delayed by 1 hour no explanation provided. Our bags never arrived - they somehow were sent to London! The luggage counter in Edinburgh is not manned - it’s subcontracted out to another company who makes you fill out a form but no one seems to know what next! Finally figured out a web based link for reporting missing bags etc. when we landed in Dublin from an overnight flight from Philadelphia no breakfast/tea or coffee was served! I won’t travel Aer Fungus even if were free. No respect/accommodation for passengers - avoid at any cost.,,,,,
"  I had to cancel my tickets and I have not received any refund, though I was promised an 85% refund. I have to wait two or three hours on hold for their customer service staff. After the long wait, I receive no real information about the status of my refund. I was told that it will take two weeks to receive the refund. Another time I was told that it will four to six weeks. It have been 9 weeks since I cancelled my tickets. The last time I contacted Aer Lingus customer service, I was promised that the ""refund team"" would contact me via email within 24 hours. That did not happen. I have requested the refund using the Aer Lingus web site also. No one has acknowledged that my request has been received.",,,,,
  Delayed bags and terrible customer service.  First and last time I will ever fly Aer Lingus. Medication‘s in the bag they’ve supposedly been out for delivery for two days but nobody can give me any real information because the folks are in call centers in Asia. I’m solo traveling I don’t have my medication I’m supposed to check out today and take a train to another country so now I don’t know whether to spend my own money to stay wait for my bag of course getting refunds for any of this is probably going to be impossible. Do yourself a favor learn from my mistake and spend more for a better airline,,,,,
 I just don't get how much the quality of service differs. I flew out to Lisbon on Tuesday and back today. I booked the Aer space seat and was really impressed with the quality of the lovely cabin crew on my flight to Lisbon. They offered me drinks and a snack. Today however was a different story and on my return leg in the same Aer space seat was good except a crew person who was not shall we say as lovely as the former crew. Said person didn’t even offer me the snack and only when I asked if I could have it they said it wasn’t much! So not impressed,,,,,
"  The worst ground service of my life. They took away my carry on guitar. Then, instead of giving it to me at the gate, as they were supposed to do, they lost the guitar by sending it through the conveyor belts when I had to take a connecting flight. Then, they lost both of my suitcases. I have not been able to contact anyone from the airline, even though I have been calling and emailing daily for 4 months. I am tired of dealing with their lack of customer support.",,,,,
  Flight was overbooked on first flight and flight delayed one hour with no updates to passengers. Return flight also delayed one hour with no explanation at all. Flight attendants were neither friendly nor helpful. System went down and could not generate boarding passes for 51 flights. This airline is the worst I have ever used in 12 years of international travel. I would never use them again.,,,,,
"  Worst customer service ever. My flight from BHX to DUB was cancelled due to system crash on Sept 10, so I also missed my connection back to America. At the airport we were told to leave (after hours of them continuing to add another one-hour delay). There were no Aer Lingus employees at the airport by then (they left when the computers crashed). No help, no hotel voucher, no re-book assist, etc. It was impossible to get through on their phone line. I paid out of pocket for another airline to get me home (someone at the airport said you could book on own and they would reimburse). 2 emails to Aer Lingus for refund and still no reply.",,,,,
"  Because of the current horrible airline situation world wide, we cancelled our flight to Ireland, England and Scotland. We didn't want to get stuck because of cancelled flights. I called a month prior to our flight to cancel. I was told I would get a voucher for the value of the tickets good for five years. I understood a refund couldn't be offered because I didn't purchase a refundable ticket. The voucher was fine. The agent checked the timing of the cancellation and said it was well within the period necessary to receive a voucher. I was also told that I would be after my flight was originally schedule before someone could get back to me since they were very busy. I received the following email confirming the refund. Dear Mrs. Ruppert, Our sincere apologies for the delayed response. Your voucher request was approved; however, we do not currently have the ability to redeem vouchers for travel on other airlines, and your original ticket included travel on A A Airlines. As a courtesy, until this is remedied, we will offer a refund. Kindly reply to this email to confirm if you would like to proceed with the refund, thank you. Kind regards, Customer Service Agent. Now Aer Lingus refuses to provide the voucher they promised in the confirmation email. My next vacation will not be to Ireland.",,,,,
"  Food is bad, service is no more than they have to do, not very friendly. Seats are too close together, half of the screens don't work. I think it is time to update your aircraft.",,,,,
"  Never again. I fly every week & I'm not using this airline again. My 3.20pm flight has still not left & it is now 5.36pm. The engines have not started up yet & the communications have been appalling on the continued delays all afternoon! I had booked assistance, and stupidly thought, it would not be required as it’s such a short flight. I’m now in agony, very stressed & not so much as an apology from the Airline. I’ll be taking my regular business travel elsewhere.",,,,,
 Geneva to Dublin. Airline's IT systems went down and I was left 9 hours in the airport with zero updates from the company or staff. Was eventually accommodated in a 4 star hotel nearby at midnight but extremely poor service and I will be flying with Ryanair in the future. I had to book a flight home the next day for 200euro with another airline but still haven't been compensated for anything.,,,,,
"  The service on my flights from Washington to Dublin, and back to Washington from Dublin, was minimal. There was one full drink service meal at the beginning of both flights, but only a small snack later. There was no second drink service at all on the flight to Dublin, and only a coffee and tea service on the flight to Washington. The lack of a second drink service was especially bad on the flight to Dublin, since there was a long line at Immigration and I couldn't get my morning caffeine fix until after I claimed my bag and was in the public area of the airport. Aer Lingus is a little bit cheaper than other airlines, but it's still not that cheap - for paying more than $600 roundtrip, I expect that they can offer some coffee and tea or another soda before landing. I think Aer Lingus needs to decide if they want to be a low cost carrier where nothing is free but everything is available for a price, or a full service carrier with commensurate service. The middle ground they are occupying now is leaving their customers hungry and under-caffeinated.",,,,,
"  When changing this flight from its original booking I had a problem with the price of the rebooked flight. Their advertising states no change fees. This was not true. I decided to call customer service to resolve the issue. After waiting on hold for 3 hours I gave up and went the chat bot route. Really slow and after 6 hours of basically giving them my details, PNR etc I got a message to call customer service again - after a couple of hours on hold I managed to speak to the agent and explained my issue. He was no help and when I said I wasn’t happy with his answer which was the opposite of their website info, he hung up. On the flight they ran out of meals. When I suggested they get me something from business class the answer was a flat no. I will never use Aer Lingus again for any route out of Dublin where I live and will use alternative airlines. Aer Lingus has fallen a long long way and has all the characteristics of the very worst budget airlines. A real shame for a once great airline!",,,,,
"  Scheduled to fly to Rome on September 13, 2022, with my wife in business class. unfortunately, on September 8, 2022, I was diagnosed with COVID. I notified the airline and was told I could either obtain a voucher or get a credit refund. I opted for a credit refund. however, even after submitting a claim with my covid results, I was denied the full refund of $8300. Their reason of course was that i did not cancel prior to the 14 days requirement. Obviously if I knew I would come down with COVID I would have cancelled with the 14day requirement being met. However, I could not have known I would contract covid less than 1 week before the flight. I find the very quick response denying my full refund to be an absolute bureaucratical decision, without any thought process being given to the extreme circumstances. I returned their email asking the person, if they would prefer that I travelled on their aircraft knowing that i had covid. to date I have not had a response. Terrible customer service skills and a terrible decision. They will now refund the $8300 minus 15% admin fees. Guess who will never use Aer Lingus again.",,,,,
"  I missed my DUB to LAX flight due to the mismanagement and lack of staff at the Aer Lingus ticket counter at the Dublin Airport. I had allowed three hours between my incoming flight from Oslo and outgoing from Dublin. However, we got stuck at the gate for a half hour before ground crew could even wheel a staircase to the airline! After retrieving my suitcase, I headed to the Aer Lingus ticket counter only to discover I couldn't retrieve a boarding pass from the kiosk. I went to the ""Ticket Assistance"" counter and was told to stand in line with about 120 other people to check in and get a boarding pass. I attempted to check in online but never got through on the website. I was in line for at least an hour. There were only three personnel handling the 100+ passengers who also could not check in. Consequently, by the time I got to the counter and handed over my passport, the assistant actually left the counter for a few minutes! She then told me there was no time for me to catch my 5:15 flight. I went to the ""Ticket Assistance"" counter again and was told that because I had booked my ticket through Alaska Airlines (which is incorrect), they couldn't help me. Apparently, if you purchase your ticket from any site other than Aer Lingus, you're screwed. When I inquired as to my options, I was told the next flight out would be the next day at the same time and it would cost me $800 (one way). I paid $800 for a round-trip ticket from LAX to DUB and that also meant I had to find a hotel room for the night, which cost me another 239 Euro. All because Aer Lingus was short staffed and unwilling to assist me.",,,,,
"  Flew business class to JFK and return from Dublin. The seats are comfortable and good for sleeping. The crew are very friendly. The food is good but there are some frills missing for a business class product. The menu is on a flimsy piece of paper, no wine or drinks list is offered, the table is not covered with a linen cloth as on most other airlines, breakfast on the flight from JFK to Dublin is awful, and no choice is offered other than a terrible bacon roll, awful coffee and freezing fruit plate, this needs to be sorted as most passengers don't order dinner, as they wish to sleep so a nicer breakfast would be much better in my opinion. It's a solid product but has room for improvement.",,,,,
  I took off from Paris with a 20 hour layover in Dublin. The flight was delayed for over 2 hours. Upon arrival to Dublin Aer port I went to retrieve my baggage. Unfortunately it was lost. Before I checked this bag in in Paris I had told the check in lady that I do not want to check in my carry on. This was literally a small carry on that had no business being checked in. The lady said that the plane was full and that I should just check it in. This made absolutely no sense to me once I reached the inside of the aircraft which had an insurmountable amount of space for my carry on. Unfortunately I ended up checking in the baggage and once I reached Dublin my baggage was lost by the airline. Now I have no information on the status of my package. Only thing I can do is wait on them to find it and ship it to me. I had very important work related things in that luggage.,,,,,
"  Aer Lingus is the best airline I’ve flown. They have comfortable seats, good food and a wide range of content on their IFE systems. They are responsive, modern and quick. The staff was helpful and friendly. I had one bad experience with a flight attendant who was short and rude with me. That is the only negative thing with Aer Lingus. ",,,,,
" San Francisco to Paris via Dublin. Do NOT use this airline. It was our first time using them and it will definitely be our last. Both flights to our destination were late, putting us behind by about 2 hours on our arrival to Paris. A little annoying, but fine. However, the trip home was absolutely wretched lol and I cannot emphasize this enough. To start, when we arrived to check in (2 hours before boarding) there was already an announcement stating the flight was delayed by 1 hr. Once boarded we sat for an additional HOUR on the tarmac, causing us to miss our connecting flight home (amazingly the only flight of theirs that left only 15 minutes late). They re-routed us to Seattle, which meant an addition 2.5 hour layover before boarding the connecting flight. There was no offer of food or beverages even though we were missing our in-flight meal service. Once we boarded the connecting flight we AGAIN sat for 1 hour and 45 minutes in the tarmac. No offer of snacks or food. Mind you we are about 4 hours past when we should of had out meal service so we were starving. Thank god our last flight from Seattle to San Fran was with Alaska Airlines as they were great. So to sum things up, we were originally to be home at 3:30 pm on 9/2 but we didn’t arrive until 9/3 at 12 am and of course our baggage was still in Dublin, adding an additional 30 minutes in the airport to submit a claim for the lost bags. It was a nightmare and I will never ever use them again.",,,,,
"  The airline personnel were wonderful; however, the plane was horrid. Only 3 bathrooms worked and two of those ran out of water in flight. Most people had no entertainment because their system was frozen and no WiFi was available. There were no recharging ports on the plane. I was with a tour group, and I will recommend that the group never again uses Aer Lingus! I know I will never make a personal reservation with them!",,,,,
"  On the way to the UK the flight the TV’s in the headrests were non-functioning. The way back was where the pain comes from however. Got a subtle little text at 4 am (of the morning of my flight that my flight home had been canceled. Their website was non functional and I couldn’t call their customer support because after waiting for an hour on hold they hung up on me. I got to Gatwick airport and there were no Aer Lingus employees. Some poor man from Gatwick was handling an entire flight of people who had been cancelled, not rebooked, and shunned by the company. After calling the customer service again I was able to reach someone who reluctantly helped me change the bookings, however due to their screw up I could not make their connecting flight back to the states. They refused to give me a voucher for another airline and informed me that there was nothing they could do and I would be stranded in Europe for another day at least. When I finally did get to board my flight to Dublin from London they only released the gate location 15 minutes before takeoff. When I arrived at the gate we waited for another 30 minutes as the plane had yet to taxi to the gate. Once finally through the boarding pass check we were herded into the loading area only to have to stand there, cramped like sardines, as they informed us that refueling had to happen and now we must stand in the boarding area.",,,,,
  The flight was on time and arrived ahead of schedule. The cabin crew were courteous and efficient. One piece of my checked in luggage did not arrive and one of the flight attendants personally assisted me in filing a report. Despite all this I was able to board a bus departing 30 minutes after my scheduled arrival time. Thank you Aer Lingus,,,,,
"  When my wife and I checked into the desk, we were told that they were not able to seat us together. The employee at checking said that he would see what he could do. When we boarded the plane, I asked one of the cabin crew if he could help us get seats together and he assured me that he would try. Needless to say, this did not happen. I was seated beside a lovely woman from Ireland and she felt sorry for me so she switched seats with my wife 5 rows back so that we could seat together. I thanked her profusely for her generous offer. After we took of from Toronto, I became aware of an isle seat (what the Irish lass had given up) was vacant. I had to ask the cabin crew to ask this lovely lass to move to this seat. Why could a big airline such as Aer Lingus be so damn ignorant to their passengers? Having said this, we will neither fly or recommend this airline. It left a very bad taste in my mouth.",,,,,
"  I had paid $50 in advance (on top of my airfare) to reserve a window seat in Row 14. I was reassigned to a center aisle seat near the rear of the aircraft with no explanation given. I have contacted the airline but they have refused to refund my money and now I have to go through the authorities.  IFE systems did not work properly on the DUB-ORD leg of my flight. No free alcohol was served on either leg. I'm not sure if this is a new policy specific to this airline or if it is industry-wide. The cabin looked reasonably clean, and the food was fairly good but they ran out of my preferred meal choice (chicken) by the time they got to my seat near the rear of the aircraft. The beverage portion sizes were very small: 6 oz. (160 ml). cans of soda. Flight time (wheels up to wheels down) was 7 hours and 51 minutes. Once we reached cruise altitude, flight attendants marched up and down the aisles demanding passengers close their window shades, and then the lights were dimmed to a lavender color. I walked up to the galley and confronted the purser to demand an explanation, and his response was that they did this to allow passengers to sleep.  Most people do not ant to sleep on a flight in the early afternoon. What's the point in paying $50 for a window that you don't get to look out of? By the time I landed back home in Chicago at 2:00 in the afternoon, I felt terribly drowsy when I should've been wide awake and readjusting to Central Daylight Time. I can tell you this much: next time I fly, if I'm seated at a window, no flight attendant is going to dictate to me whether the shade is up or down.",,,,,
"  When we checked in at Chicago they charged me 100 dollars for a carry on they claim was too big. My daughter had the same carry on, but a solid green. On the return flight out luggage made it to Dublin, but hers did not make it onto the flight to Chicago. It has been over 72 hours and they are still unable to locate her luggage. Aer Lingus has not been helpful in trying to locate her luggage.",,,,,
"  The plane and airline itself is very average. Decent quality television, meals were alright, however. The part that makes me give this airline below a 1 star is the fact they managed to lose 3 out of 4 of our luggage. As a student, the 2 most important items I lost were my laptop and clothes. It's been 12 days since, and my family has only gotten luggage with mattress linens, nothing important. We filed a claim, and have been ignored completely. Even if we did get reimbursed, there's data on my laptop that simply cannot be retrieved without the hard drive and the data was critical to my work as a student. Today, I found out that there is an entire facebook group called ""Aer Lingus Complaints Action Group"" with hundreds of people sharing this same experience, noting that Aer Lingus will not do anything unless you file a DOT complaint. They will ignore you, leave you on hold for an hour just to hang up, if you do not file a DOT complaint.",,,,,
"  Aer Lingus is a partner airline of Alaska Air. I am a million mile frequent flier of Alaska Air and have family in Manchester, UK. This means Seattle and Manchester is a frequent route for me and my family. I agree with other reviews that there are frequent delays - this month 3 hours from starting airport with no explanation or acknowledgement that it has even happened. As we were landing in Dublin we were told that there would be staff to meet us to sort out what to do since we were too late for connections - the last 3 trips this has not been true. There were 14 of us for one connection 2 weeks ago- no one to help, no one to book onto next flight and we were told the connecting flight waited for the first class connecting passengers and then left. The Aer Lingus staff are stone faced and unhelpful when we asked for another flight to get to our destination. We had to collect our bags go all the way out to check in and line up to speak to the single agent for all the Aer Lingus passengers with issues. Again not one acknowledgement of a problem the caused. Most of the passengers had to overnight in Dublin. After 3 return trips I will never get on this airline again nor would I let a family member go through it because it takes travel experience to know what to do to repair the trip.",,,,,
"  My experience with Aer Lingus has been disgraceful and I would not recommend flying with them. I travelled from Auckland to Belfast to see family with Emirates and my last leg (London to Belfast) was with Aer Lingus. They lost all my check-in luggage for the duration of the trip and I spent much of my two week trip home in call waiting queues, which I was regularly on for over an hour and half at a time, only to be cut off and rushing around buying clothes and other essentials. I have sent emails, filled in their website forms and on my second to last day managed to get through to a person at lost baggage services. I told them so send my bags back to Auckland as I would be leaving the address that they had on file for me in Belfast, so wouldn't be there. They delivered the bags to the address I had already left and managed to ruin that day too. Its been 7 weeks now, I have sent many emails, tried calling loads of times even tried their online chat services and they don't respond - nothing, you are just sent in circles all the while they are taking other peoples money and running a shambles of an airline. I of course understand that bags do get lost from time to time, but the utter contempt you must have for your customers to not even respond to calls or emails for nearly 2 months is totally disgraceful. This company not only ruined a 2 week trip to the other side of the world but they have cost me a small fortune in international call (on hold from NZ for an hour a time) and in purchases replacing items that they lost. The level of incompetence and lack of any care for their customers is breathtaking. I will never fly with these people again.",,,,,
"  Absolutely disastrous. Not expecting much from Economy, but a modicum of service would have been appreciated. Original outbound flight delayed by ~2 hours with no explanation. Lateness required an additional leg (DUB to London, then on to final destination)--arrived many hours late. After paying ~$1000 per ticket RT, I would have thought that a bottle/glass of water might be complimentary, but it costs 2 Euros for intra-Europe legs. I noticed that seating for 3 families (not ours though) was messed up (e.g., mother and 2 kids of ~2 years were assigned separate seats). International flights priced as premium airlines but services are low-cost airline quality. The savings of up to 20% for any Aer Lingus flight is not worth the savings. You have been warned.",,,,,
"  Absolute worst airline I have ever used. I am a member to the Global Entry Trusted Traveler Program and stunned that Aer Lingus does not participate.  To find out why I did not have TSA precheck on my boarding pass I had to wait in the Aer Lingus line for almost 2 hours and then another 90 minutes in the TSA line. Once onboard I never received the special meal I ordered. I was also denied a refill of water. I got off the flight dehydrated and feeling dizzy and weak. The Aer Lingus app is also completely worthless. Would never recommend this airline to anyone. Amazed that Alaska Airlines recognizes such a cut rate, customer unfriendly airline as part of its frequent flyer program.",,,,,
"  The very worst travel experience of our lives. Flight from O'Hare was late to leave, which caused us to miss our also-Aer Lingus connection in Dublin. Flight staff was snippy and unpleasant. When a later-day flight to Amsterdam finally got us there, Aer Lingus had left our luggage in Dublin. This left us trapped at Amsterdam until the day's third flight brought our bag. All in all, what should have been an easy flight with a connection turned I to a 32 hour travel day, most of which spent waiting for Aer Lingus to either show up, find our bag, or otherwise demonstrate basic competence as an airline. Never again.",,,,,
"  July 28th, 2022 - secured my seats with Aer Lingus to ensure my daughters (minors) were seated with a parent. Agent provided seat numbers and confirmation. August 10th 2022 - Checked app the day before flight to see no seat numbers. Jumped on a chat with Aer Lingus. They didn't have any information even after I provided the detail and confirmation. They just said go online at 9:25 to book the seats. That didn't confirm my kids were with me. They didn't care at all or take ownership for dropping the ball. Waited on the phone for over an hr to be hung up on by the agent. No one helped. No one cared. No one took ownership despite me being responsible weeks in advance. Still unsure if my kids will sit with me or my husband tomorrow.",,,,,
  The ticket is pricing low earlier and goes up significantly over time. It says free of charge to change the ticket but you have to pay the difference which is almost $1000 more when you change your flight on the last days. You end up to pay a higher price for low quality of flight.  The baggage was missing and you have to fill out form and pick them up a couple of days later. The return flight was a few hours late and ended up missing the second flight and waiting in the airport 5-6 hours more for the rescheduled flight.,,,,,
  EI 722 From Cork to London Heathrow on 8th August 2022 was a showcase of what an airline can do well on a short flight! Check-in online worked a treat and the bag-drop at Cork Airport was made speedy by machines and a very helpful and professional mature lady who went out of her way to help an elderly gentleman and then a family with a disabled child. This staff member is an absolute credit to Aer Lingus. Boarding was orderly and well managed and I noted how the crew were very well turned out and clearly took pride in their work. The female pilot made clear and precise announcements and the cabin crew gave a serious safety announcement and then made sure passengers were compliant with safety measures. During the flight the crew served “to buy” drinks and then duty free items. The flight arrived ahead of schedule and disembarkation was again orderly and well managed by a professional crew who are a credit to Aer Lingus and to their country for that matter. My gripe with this flight was the rather high fee charged for one small bag of 13kg I checked in online. In all other respects I was impressed with Aer Lingus on this occasion. It was nice too to hear Irish used by some of the crew.,,,,,
" Cascais to Bragança with Aero VIP. Services are provided by SevenAir. The site is easy. I had a couple of questions and the support was fantastic. The plane was just fine, despite being a propeller, thus a bit noisy.",,,,,
" Bragança to Cascais with Aero VIP. Seven Air provides the services. The pilot was very nice and made sure everyone was comfortable and explained there would be some turbulence, which was normal. Flight arrived 5 minutes late.",,,,,
"  Funchal to Porto Santo. This 10-minutes flight is a true experience. Aero Vip carries out the public service obligation connection between Funchal and the smaller Porto Santo airport located on the island with the same name. The outbound flight was on a vintage (1989) Jetstream 32 turboprop airliner with the return flight being on a slightly older (1987) Jetstream 31. In both cases the safety briefing was carried out by the first officer himself, as the plane does not have any FA on board. The outbound flight left right on time and touched down in PXO just 10/15 minutes later. The plane on the way back arrived late and we left PXO with some 30 minutes of delay, again reaching our destination in slight over 10 minutes. The planes’ interiors are quite worn out but overall the planes gave me the impression of being in a good mechanical shape. If you take this flight to reach the beaches in Porto Santo, as was my case, the whole flight is a really fun and unique retro-experience for aviation enthusiasts which unfortunately comes with a hefty price tag (150 EUR return). It needs to be said however, that the rates are much cheaper for residents who need this flight as a means to ensure territorial continuity.",,,,,
Havana - Cayo Coco return. A one hour flight with an old ATR42 turboprop. Seats surprisingly comfortable and we were offered a free drink plus candy onboard. Nothing special but we arrived on time.,,,,,
Holguin to Havana last week. Okay apart from issuing duplicate boarding cards to different passengers. Return was in a turbo prop plane which was 1 hour late and was infested by cockroaches running along the floor overhead lockers and electrical ducts. The plane was generally dirty. Obvious lack of maintenance.,,,,,
What a wonderful friendly airline. Flew with them Hholguin to Havana and back. Both flights only minor delays was served juice and a cake on this short internal flight safety demonstration was done.,,,,,
  I had booked a flight from Greece to Cuba. Due to COVID it was cancelled. I accepted a voucher to travel later. Then came the war and there are no flights over Europe. I asked for my refund and the reply was that I have to travel to Russia to receive my refund from Russian territory by myself. No other options. I didn't have to visit Russia to book my ticket. ,,,,,
  Has your flight been cancelled by Aeroflot themselves? Forget about your money back. You will never see them. I'm waiting for a refund for last 2.5 years! ,,,,,
"  Aeroflot has set high standards of achieving a 5-star airline status and my expectations significantly increased as a result. Positives included a seamless upgrade from Comfort to Business at LHR, good Plaza Premium lounge, very good miles earning vs redeeming ratio. The A350 hard product is phenomenal, especially on a short London route, and the catering on this flight exceeded the expectations (usually poor hot meal, however, the 4 cheese pappardelle was very good). However, there are two drawbacks on Aeroflot. Firstly, I  dislike Aeroflot’s or SVO’s standard practice of parking planes at the literally remotest ramps possible in -6C and with ice covering the stairs. I understand there maybe logistics issues, but doing so to a premium-heavy flight like London and for their most luxurious widebody is just beyond logic. I am observing that the crew service on the A350 / B777 is poorer than on their other planes. It gave me a feeling that the crew were very much undertrained; as a result the service, although efficient, felt very rushed and unpolished.  I still believe that the Aeroflot Business Class is above any of its European counterparts from the overall package size view, and if one manages to upgrade for miles (amazing redemption value) like I often do, then this product is possibly the best business class. However, full-fare paying passengers might be disappointed, because, in addition to a cutting-edge hard product, for such money, you expect a hospitable and personalised staff service beyond the ‘just tick’ attitude.  Overall, is Aeroflot a good airline, yes. Is Aeroflot a 5-star level airline and is its business class worth paying a full fare, no.",,,,,
"  Best airline in Russia! Very nice staff, comfortable seats (I don't ask much, I mean this is coming from a girl who drives tanks), good service and power supplies, anything you can possibly ask for, enough room for my single bag, and even more room. Great service, good crew, wonderful meals, and so much more!! Ground service, I was pushed around a lot, but that isn't the staffs' fault. I don't remember turning on my in-flight entertainment system, I was too busy playing World of Tanks Blitz with the incredible WiFi.",,,,,
"  I was very impressed with the staff. Many thanks to the Aeroflot representative Nina at Larnaca, who was extremely professional, friendly and genuinely caring for her passengers. The cabin crew were outstanding as well, especially the flight attendant Asiya and the purser Irina. They did everything to make people onboard happy.",,,,,
"  I missed my flight due to a confusion with the flights in the airport (Moscow SVO) - when two flights of Aeroflot were scheduled to the same destination with a difference of approx. 20 minutes, but one of them was not shown on the departure board (for some unknown reason). As a result I missed my flight arriving 5 minutes late to my gate. Other passengers were at the gate before me and still were not allowed to the flight. When I approached the customer desk in Moscow with my issue of a missed flight I still had three more connecting flights left in my round trip ticket. They informed me that the whole ticket was cancelled. It took them months to respond after and no support was provided with regard to my cancelled flights. How about the so called bonus miles program? Apparently it's not even possible to spend them in any way if you haven't reached 3000 miles. So, some of my flights with Aeroflot were not even counted in the miles account even though I travel quite often. Is there a bug not counting the miles even when you enter the frequent flyer number?",,,,,
"  Flight quite uneventful, although the hard product on Boeing 777 needs to be refurbished: it is outdated and worn. Crew were okay, although they seemed very stressed and exhausted from servicing a booked-out 777, full of families and crying babies l (on a 3-hour flight), and service felt very rushed and inattentive at times. SVO Terminal C is beautiful, but crowded and full of bottlenecks, resulting in long queues at security and long walking distances. The Malevich lounge, though, is excellent. It is well-planned and has numerous comfortable seating with amazing tarmac views and, despite being severely overcrowded, it didn’t feel like it. Overall, an okay experience, although much improvement is needed if Aeroflot wishes to achieve their ambitions of becoming a 5-star airline.",,,,,
" Positives: convenient booking via mobile app, very easy to upgrade from Economy to Comfort Class online, stylish new terminal C, professional and efficient crew, excellent business class-level soft product at Premium Economy (proper business class meal with metal cutlery, amenity kit, hot towels, cloth napkins). Drawbacks: B777-300ER in need of refurbishment (hopefully this is coming soon), very hard, wobbly, uncomfortable seats resulting in back pain, unaffordable internet, new terminal severely overcrowded (even worse than in the older Terminal D). Overall, a great product for a 4-hour flight, however, should if it was a long-haul flight, I would have reservations.",,,,,
"  Aeroflot has a good planes and good pilots, but the service was pretty bad, the lines in Moscow airport are long and disorganised, in Miami they pushed me to paid an additional PCR for couple hours of my previous test. Flight attendants let people occupy 3 chairs and sleep but you can't sit in the economy seat In front of the toilet because they call it economy comfort. They keep the plane extremely hot, normal in Russia but extremely annoying for non russian. I will avoid it if I can.",,,,,
"  
The premium economy service was entirely satisfactory. The seat doesn’t have a lot of recline, but the legroom was fine for a 6’1” (185 cm) person and I was comfortable for the whole eight-hour trip. I liked the food well enough and appreciated having actual metal cutlery (though serving wine in a paper cup seemed a bit déclassé). The entertainment system had quite a wide variety of both movies and music. There was only one W.C. for a cabin of 50+ passengers, which is the only notable demerit that I found. Price was acceptable for a last-minute trip (purchased six hours before departure); the online purchasing was simple and efficient.",,,,,
"  Horrible experience at Sheremetyevo Airport. Huge queue for check-in across the whole airport, not organized with lots of people cutting it. Very poor communication to passengers. Aeroflot representative said it is not their responsibility how their clients organize themselves in all that mess. Almost missed my flight (was called from the queue and then had to rush through passport control and security for the boarding). Flight attendants were good though.",,,,,
"  My flight in 2020 was cancelled by Aeroflot Russia one week before the travel date. I have been waiting for over 15 months for a refund that was initially agreed by the airline, however they have not provided me with a refund despite weekly emails and contacts made to them.",,,,,
"  I had booked tickets for my family to visit me in Denmark in May 2020, the tickets got cancelled and no refund. I contacted customer care and they are suggesting e-voucher. I am ready to take the e-voucher but there is no flight from India to Denmark for this month, next month and in May 2021. So logically I cannot use the e-voucher. Aeroflot don't have flight for using e-voucher so please refund my money.",,,,,
"  When countries announces border closure, Aeroflot did not notify me of the cancellation of the flight before the borders were closed. I learned about the flight cancellation from the media. When I phoned Aeroflot to change the date of my flight, =I had to stay in the telephone queue for around an hour, and when the operator picked up the phone, she ask me to stay on the line a minute, however went away for at least half an hour and never returned. As tickets for alternative flights were being bought by other people and prices were rising very quickly, the only realistic option was to buy a new ticket from Aeroflot for a date before the closure of borders, and then claim a refund. The price of this new ticket was several times more expensive than the original ticket. Aeroflot have refused to provide a refund for the new ticket. Aeroflot cancelled the flight due to border closure, failed to inform me about it before the border closures, failed to change the date of the flight, and refused to provide a compensation for the new ticket.",,,,,
"  I purchased a ticket in November 2020 that had no COVID restrictions for transiting in Moscow, there is no policy for COVID testing when you transit Moscow. We were denied boarding for no COVID test, tho our destination, Turkey does not require any. We were denied boarding after being checked in, luggage tagged, boarding passes issued. Manager did not agree to ticket refund, tho it is a refundable ticket. ",,,,,
  I bought my tickets for travel in April 2020 for my friend and I and unfortunately because of the Covid-19 my flight was cancelled. I’ve subscribe for a refund and 5 months later I still didn’t get news of it. I’ve send messages and answers was useless. So I’ve called the center the lady on the phone didn’t seem to understand what’s going on and she told me that I can’t do a refund anymore I need to do voucher. So I’ve decided to do my voucher and the website didn’t work. So I’ve sand email to the center again nd this afternoon I’ve tried the voucher with my friend name and she got her voucher back but you can only use 15% on it so how many flight I need to do to have my £800 back?. And with my name I can’t have my voucher I don’t know why for my ticket that put error.  I’ve been fighting during almost 10 months to have my refund. It shouldn’t take that time and that energy to have the money you said you’d pay me back. ,,,,,
"  My flight was cancelled by Aeroflot back in April. We called multiple times throughout April, May and June and I was promised a refund of the full amount. It was obviously not up to me whether to take that flight or not and it is reasonable to expect a full refund. However refund was never provided. I tried to send multiple messages to the airline’s customer service as well with no response. Last week I tried to call Aeroflot customer service. I had to pay for the international call as there are no representatives in Australia where I live. The customer service was extremely poor. To be honest, I have not encountered such poor attitude in years and it was extremely frustrating. The customer service representative could not properly address any of the issues. She said that the only two options are a voucher and reissuing new ticket. Well, I don’t live in Russia or even Europe so there is absolutely no way I can use these options. The reason why I bought a ticket with Aeroflot was that the transfer time was convenient on my way from Rome to Tokyo, I was not even intending to visit Russia. I explained it and no, nothing she was willing to do, just continued quoting new Russian legislation that came into effect half a year after I bought the ticket! I asked to explain how come I was promised a refund previously and was held waiting for months and months and now it’s not an option. She couldn’t explain. She said I can submit complain through the feedback section. I explained that I have tried to communicate the issue through the feedback section already and not getting any response. She said she can’t help with. Then I asked her to connect me to her supervisor and no, she couldn’t do it for some reason. This is the first time ever I couldn’t speak to a customer service manager or a supervisor. Basically the company just decided to keep my money that I paid, go ahead with it and customer service did not care at all. I just lost a lot of money on the international call without any resolution. This situation is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. Every other airline I booked with that cancelled flights provided me a refund a while ago, despite COVID-19. Understand there are struggles at the moment and I did accept a voucher from an Australian airline because I can use it living in Australia. But I just can't use an Aeroflot voucher. The ticket wasn’t a cheap ticket either and it was refundable and it is outrageous that I can’t get money back for a ticket that was refundable (and I paid a premium for it to be refundable and have an option to receive a refund). I sent another message to the airline following the call and received the same response about vouchers that is pretty much just their copy paste from the customer service templates. The airline does not care about their customers and reputation and is just exploiting COVID-19 situation to hold customers’ cash for as long as possible (if not indefinite).",,,,,
" London to Moscow on brand new A350-900. I must say I’ve experienced one of the best business class hard products in the world. Amazing suits with doors, featuring a huge and easy to navigate IFE screen with lots of movies and music, super comfortable lie-flat seat, lots of storage space, and great touches, such as a personal wardrobe, and a locker with a mirror. Staff were amazing, food was good (although I think Aeroflot still has a room for improvement here, especially if it wants to become a 5 star airline), and ground service was quick and efficient. All in all, Aeroflot’s A350 is definitely above and beyond any competition from other European carriers.",,,,,
"  Aeroflot is not refunding cancelled tickets due to Corona. I booked many flights in the past months, all were refunded in a couple of months. Aeroflot refuses to do that, I am so disappointed.",,,,,
"  London to Moscow on Aeroflot B773. I always wanted to try out their Comfort Class, and had an opportunity this time. I must say that the soft product is amazing. Excellent business class quality meals (must say, even better than in business class), highly professional, efficient and super friendly crew, good ground experience in London (many Aeroflot representatives at Heathrow, guiding and informing passengers at check in and near boarding). My big complaint though was the shell seat, which was hard to sit on, had really poor recline, and it’s footrest was quite useless. Otherwise, i loved the product and found it much more worthy in value than Aeroflot’s average European business class.",,,,,
"  On 8th August, 2020 we sent 8 seafarers via Aeroflot by flight SU2578 to London Heathrow where crew should had been departed the same day to the USA. All seafarers hold guarantee letters from agent in the USA, from Company, issued tickets to the USA and valid c1d USA visas. But check-in and registration was refused by Aeroflot at check-in desk and their representative at Sheremetevo Airport showed low competency while refusing registration. Aeroflot representative denied accept immigration exemption of UK government for transit of seafarers with valid C1D visas, refused talking to Company representative and was rude. On hot line of Aeroflot we were told that it is unacceptable that their representative behaved like this. Because of incompetence of Aeroflot employee we lost lot of time and nerves. All was solved once this employee finished his working day and more informed and professional representative let registration for flight for our seafarers. ",,,,,
"  My flight from Madrid to Bangkok got cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic, I been calling and emailing many times for 5 months, initially, they said it would take up to 10 days to process my refund, then they said they had so many cancellations and have to process each of them manually so I could take up to 2 month, called again after 2 month, they keep saying my refund will be processed buy they can't tell when. I will end up spending more money and time trying to solve this than the money spent on my ticket. They do not provide any solution, neither seem to care, they do not answer my emails. They are ghosting people trying to get them tired of calling emailing, claiming for their money, so they don't have to refund the money, offering vouchers. ",,,,,
  Aeroflot refunded fully the ticket costs by clicking only only button. The process was easy and fast. My flight was not cancelled it’s just due to the new quarantine rules in the country of arrival I had to cancel the ticket. I was surprised and please to see how easy and fast the refund process is. Other airlines offer vouchers or refund only 30% of the ticket price whereas Aeroflot did it  on their website and refunded the full fare paid. I am very pleased with the service and would be happy to book again.,,,,,
"  Having had our flights cancelled due to covid, we were advised we could have a full refund. Several emails and calls to call centre confirmed the refund would be processed. Initially we would have the refund in 5-10 days, then 30 days then they could no longer give a time frame but rest assured our booking was in a special queue to be refunded. Flash forward to today, received an email stating we were getting a voucher. That’s it. Contacted call centre again who are now saying we can rebook or wait 3 years for a refund. Appalling customer service throughout this whole situation, €1000 down the drain as will not be flying anywhere during the voucher validity. I don’t see how you can confirm a refund is being processed then turn around and say it’s no longer an option. Shameful company, would not deal with them again in future even if it was my only option.",,,,,
"  Vilnius to Tokyo via Moscow in January 2020 was a nightmare because my luggage was damaged and I spent about a month contacting them for compensation and I've got none. Nonetheless, customer support at Moscow airport doesn't care. While people were rushing and had urgent questions, all 3 women at the counter just put a ""break 15min"" sign and left. I had a ticket back to Lithuania on June 6th from Tokyo, through Moscow. I knew that the flight will be canceled because Lithuania embassy information was 100% sure that borders will be closed for traveling from Moscow until July 1st. However, when I called airline, they said that it's not true, and they are not sure about that, I still canceled my flight, because I always buy flights with cancelation option. (Flight was officially canceled just a couple days before the departure). Their policy says that return takes around 10 working days. Its been a month and all they say is Wait. Even customer support on the phone is poorly mannered. I understand that this epidemic time is very bad for airlines, but it is not a customer problem. ",,,,,
  Purchased full fare economy refundable ticket and upgraded to business class using my SU Bonus miles. Flight was cancelled by Aeroflot. To date unable to get my refund despite numerous calls to Aeroflot call center. All they are trying to do is offer me to use a voucher despite my ticket fare being subject to a full refund. No timeframe given as to when the refund will be processed. In addition my upgrade miles are also not processed and returned to my account yet. Aeroflot has strict rules when you are buying and paying but they seem not liable to follow any binding rules with regards to refunds.,,,,,
  Moscow to Hanoi. I really liked the service. Clean cabin. Nice and comfortable seats. Very punctual. The entertainment had movies and sitcoms in several languages. They offer pillows and blankets. A complimentary amenity kit is offered as well. I liked the menu which was handed out pre flight and the food options. Enjoyed it.,,,,,
  Moscow to St Petersburgh. A new A350 plane with business class suites. They have a bad pillow which I do not find comfortable and a a bad blanket. ,,,,,
 New York to Tel Aviv via Moscow. I paid $150 for upgrading from the Economy to premium economy. The flight was full and there was no place in premium economy so they gave me a regular seat in Economy. I contacted the flight attendant to refund the money I paid for the upgrade and she referred me to a customer service I called customer service twice and mail them about what happened and they obviously ignored and said they don’t know what I am talking about. I have been waiting a year for a refund! I will never fly with them again!,,,,,

"  Bucharest to Moscow. My first time ever with Aeroflot and thoroughly enjoyed it. I can honestly say some of the best cabin service I have received anywhere. Cabin staff were friendly and warm and accommodated all requests and did everything with confidence and style. All were also immaculately attired and turned out. For a three hour flight, not overly long, they got in three services, a food run, then tea and coffee and duty free and made it look easy. I also loved the Sukhoi Superjet (SSJ100) despite all the stories about it. I chose to fly it deliberately, as I wanted to see for myself what it was like. Great little regional commuter. I found it very comfortable inside with ample leg room and a rear toilet that was huge - larger than on some big wide bodies. Plane was also very clean inside. No IFE but to be expected on short haul regional commutes and didn't phase me and didn't expect any. So my overall experience with Aeroflot from Bucharest to Moscow return, was outstanding and enjoyable and I can't think of anything to mark down. I will be flying with them again and will try a longer haul on a different aircraft to see how it compares. Based on two flights though, I would recommend them highly.",,,,,
" Ljubljana to Moscow. Both flights on time. Cabin nice and fresh, seating much better than average in economy. To my surprise, Aeroflot introduced hot meals also for flights of less than 3 hours. Menu card for lunch with 2 options and in return for breakfast with 3, meals nice and tasty. Cabin crews pleasant and working hard. Overall, great flights. The only problem is that they do not send relevant information to passengers, e.g. 24 hours before departure the departure terminal in the mail from Aeroflot was F, which was wrong, the departure terminal was actually D, a very different one far away. Still, when it comes to economy product Aeroflot and Turkish stand out from the rest in Europe.",,,,,
"  London to Dubai via Moscow. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the service provided from staff when buying our ticket at Heathrow Terminal 4. The service is second to none. When we got to Dubai was brilliant as per your advice, we are welcomed from the immigration and no trouble at all. We cannot thank you enough and staff at Heathrow are an assets to Aeroflot. Definitely will visit Moscow next time with your company!",,,,,
"  Phuket to Oslo via Moscow. The crew on board were so unfriendly to me, and the ground crew were worse. I have never had such a negative experience with any airline. They were not lifting a finger to help me, even when the flight was delayed and security process on transit was so slow that we missed our flight. They had no procedure of how to take care of passengers that missed their connection flight, and we were stuck at Moscow airport with two toddlers. My advise is simply to stay away.",,,,,
"  New York to Delhi via Moscow. The major reason behind traveling in Aeroflot is cheaper fare for the last minute booking. Although the service quality was not very good it gave me value for money. The check in process was smooth and departing terminal was quite empty. Check in agent was courteous. Cabin crews were helpful but language was the bar.  The food quality was not so good. Particularly for the SVO-DEL flight. Not only the quality, but also quantity was very low.  The inlfight entertainment was not good for non-Russian passengers. lthough they provides Wifi connectivity, but no free data. Also, data was costly. It would be good to have a small amount (may be 20 MB) of free data.",,,,,
"  Amsterdam to Hanoi via Moscow. The airline staff weighed my suitcase and backpack and threatened to not be allowed to board for the reason that my laptop backpack was too bulky and my hand suitcase was 1kg more than the allowance, they said that the flight was full. I told him I checked in from Amsterdam and all my hand luggage was fine, what can I do now, can I pay for this. He literally shouted ""You have 3 minutes to throw away your stuff now or you stay in Moscow tonight!"".  I had to throw away some of my clothes, bag of cosmetics,  book, notebook, bag of socks from my hand luggage and backpack.  Then they finally let me pass, I went on to the plane and waited until everybody has boarded to see the whole plane was at least 20% empty seated? Their staff cannot treat its client this.",,,,,

"  Irkutsk to Moscow on SU1443. They re-scheduled a flight 3h30 later than it was supposed to be. Aeroflot tends to forget that people pay to get on a certain schedule, to arrive at a certain time. In my case, I had further connections to take and I reached the gate on time. Delays happen to every companies. However, Aeroflot did not offer to change the booking as such a delay may cause me to miss connections, and with an expiring visa, being trapped din Russia is the last thing I hope at the end of my holiday. No refreshments at the airport provided by Aeroflot, no information about the updated check-in time.  Not a single goodwill action. I won't travel by Aeroflot anymore. ",,,,,
  Tel Aviv to Moscow. I ordered diabetic meal which was just not edible for me. when I tried to change the meal for the flight back they said its not possible because its 24 hours before the flight. I don't think 24 hours notification is unreasonable for changes about food. ,,,,,
"  London to Hong Kong via Moscow. Experience on board the plane was fine I was actually pleased with this. But upon arriving to my destination I was told 1 of my suitcases had not arrived and I will receive it the next day, then when my first case arrived one of the bottom wheels had been smashed off.! The next day when my other suitcase had arrived and been delivered to my home address this suitcase was also broken.",,,,,
" Moscow to Helsinki with Aeroflot. Relatively good flight: waiting for check-in took ~15min, then it was very fast. Flight on time, relatively comfortable seats, legroom decent, smiling and attentive cabin crew. Negative point: the snack served on board was a sandwich with beef, with no other alternatives - airlines should make an effort to at least offer two options (meat / non meat).",,,,,
"  Ho Chi Minh to Amsterdam via Moscow. We paid 100 euro more to select seats, with this I hoped that I would be able to book the extra leg space, I would not even mind to pay again a bit extra, this was not possible, we called with the airline and asked if they could book them for us. This was not possible, we should do this at the airport 24 hours before check in, we went to the airport to arrange this, this was not possible, we should do this in Moskou. There we had 1.5 hour transfer time. Next day we checked in and we will fix the extra leg space in Moskou, when we arrived in Moskou we had to wait in a line, because of a delay we had 45 minutes transfer time. At the transfer desk we tried to get the extra legspace.  During the flight there were many rows with the extra legspace free. I was not allowed to change seats. For the way back we managed it differently, we went again 24 hours before to the airport... no aeroflot desk.. For this flight back we managed it. With good mood at the gate the new hell starts .. 1 hour delay because of cleaning the plane and we had again 1.5 hours to transfer - arrived Moscow 35 mins late. hour long flight in stress because of the staff who can only say you go to transfer desk.",,,,,
"  Amsterdam to Hong Kong via Moscow. 13 days before my departure date, I got a message that my flight was canceled and an alternative flight was offered to me with a departure date which was 1 day earlier than my original flight. Although it was very inconvenient, I agreed on taking the alternative flight. Then 5 days before my flight, I got the message that my alternative flight was full and there was no other option then to cancel my booking with a refund. I was therefore forced to find an alternative flight myself within 5 days.  I did manage to find an alternative flight but it cost me way much more than what I originally booked.",,,,,
"  Warsaw to Moscow return. Standard in economy class is better than in LH, or LOT. We got a tasty sandwich, apple, and choco wafel. For drink, selection of juices, tea & coffee were served, in Moscow free newspapers and magazines. The aircraft was extremely clean. Flight attendants were very polite and helpful and very well organized however, the aircraft was near full. Ground service in Moscow is organized better than in e.g. CDG, or Lyon. In all airports you have to wait in the lines for passport control, it usually takes about 20 - 30 minutes, but in WAW was 20 also. From the airport is a very comfortable train to the center.",,,,,
"  Paris to Phuket via Moscow, economy class, Dec 4th 2019. Frequent Flyer with Aeroflot for nearly 3 years now, all I can say is that I'm fully satisfied with them. Swift priority check-in and security check in Paris via dedicated lanes for Frequent Flyers. Lounge access. Fly Attendants very welcoming, helpful and genuine. Space + seat (front row) and economy seat with good width (18') and pitch (32') - Aeroflot is one of the very few Airlines to still give 18 inches width (most nowadays give 17"" or less). Moscow Airport is quite good, the various lounges for Frequent Flyers / business passengers are really excellent. Arrived on time and relaxed to Phuket. Had only once in 3 years a delayed luggage (was delivered 48 hours latter to my door in Paris, free of charge to me). Overall an excellent Airline and I strongly recommend Aeroflot.",,,,,
" Aeroflot has two faces. When things run smoothly, they are okay, but when you have a problem with them, they are a pure disaster. I flew with my family from Asia to Sweden, via Moscow. Even though we had more than an hour of waiting in Moscow none of our luggage arrived with us in Sweden. We reported it. Aeroflot was extremely unclear about where and when the luggage would come, and they were unable to locate it, until it, different days, arrived in Sweden. It then turned out that one of our hard Samsonite suitcases had a hole in it. It was too big to be acceptable and I therefore made a claim to Aeroflot, in accordance with their procedure. They answered me that I should send original documentation to Moscow. I did so, but was careful enough to make copies of everything. A couple of days later they just closed my claim, without any further explanations. After that I have contacted them a large number of times, making new claims referring to the original one and so forth. When they noticed that I did not give up, they tried a new strategy – to not answer. After months of waiting, I contacted them again, and actually got an answer: that they had increased their own handling time, according to the Russian law (they said), with another 30 days. Then it was silent again. Next time I contacted them they told me to make a new claim, since the first one was not treated! When I said I did not want to they referred to the Swedish Aeroflot office, which in turn told me to send the claim to them. But when the Swedish office answered to my claim it was with the information that they would not handle the case. Indeed, I have to communicate with the Moscow office, they told me. Aeroflot clearly have no intention whatsoever to give me any compensation. If you think that your suitcases and luggage is not so much to care for, you could buy a ticket with Aeroflot, but if you have any luggage that has a value you should think more than once - and then use another air flight company.",,,,,
 Warsaw to Moscow with Aeroflot. There were no problems at check in which was prompt and without problems. We were late taking off and landing and given slow immigration control and luggage delivery in Moscow I only just managed to catch the last Aeroexpress service to the city centre.

"  London to Seoul via Moscow. I was delayed due to the cyclone hitting South Korea at the time of the flight. However, the service and unfriendliness of the staff have left a bitter taste. We arrived at about 19:30. There was very little information provided. They were arranging a hotel to stay for the night, but could not announce that until 22:00. They then took the delayed passengers upstairs and left us there for a further hour with no information. They then collected us, but we then wait another hour until the coach finally came to take us to the hotel. Once at the hotel, they let us in, in small groups. We then had to be paired with strangers in one room, but that took forever. We finally made it into a hotel room at 02:00 with the flight scheduled for 05:55. They were arranging collection at 04:00, so with only 2 hours to rest, it was a terrible experience. The staff were apathetic toward all the passengers affected. They did not seem to care and just left us all confused and without information. The flights themselves were okay, but the staff were relatively unfriendly to me. I would not recommend Aeroflot. There are better long-haul carriers for a little extra money. Do yourself a favour and spend that little bit more for better comfort and service.",,,,,
"  Moscow to Los Angeles. The airline did not allow me to select seats for my upcoming flight, but offers an option to reserve 24 hours in advance. I was flying with a family member who was able to select their seat without a problem. When it was my turn to do the same (we did it at the same time from the same computer) the system would not allow me to do it. After checking the info we decided to call their customer service. The associate  did not offer help. After admitting that all of our info is entered correctly, they told us that we need to use a different version of their software.  No resolution was offered, myself and my family member flew in different ends of the plane. ",,,,,
  Vienna to Moscow. Terrible service on arrival to their home airport of Sheremetyevo. Theyparked the aircraft at Terminal B which is on the opposite side of the airfield from the planned arrival terminal (E). Then they’ve boarded the passengers into the bus and took on 25 minutes ride around the airstrip. Overall it took 40 minutes from the moment the pilot announced that the aircraft is at the parking position till I’ve finally reached the terminal,,,,,
"  Flight from Moscow SVO to Paris CDG, approximately 3 hours long. Hassle free boarding. Very attentive cabin crew. Clean cabin. FAs kept working with passengers throughout the flight. The seats are wide and comfortable, uncomparable with pitiful masquerading of business class by other European airlines. Full scale lunch: scallops with cucumber spaghetti and salmon with wild rice were sublime. Grand cru champagne and a variety of wines. Overall impression: very robust high-quality product from Aeroflot, exemplary for other European carriers.",,,,,
"  New York to NurSultan return via Moscow. Review covers SVO-JFK, SU100/24Sep as this was the best of the four flights. Ground staff in all cities are surprisingly professional. Flights board well in advance of departure and airplanes, when loaded, depart. Schedules are not padded for time and flight time is accurate. Premium Economy is excellent value with comfortable seats, decent amenities, and big, filling meals. The only alcohol served is beer and wine; drinks service is followed immediately with meal. Oddly, the second meal on both transatlantic flights is served 3 hours before arrival which interrupts the chance for some hours of sleep. Announcements are continuous and interrupting; first, pre-recorded Russian/English followed by crew Russian/English announcements repeating the same message. Crews are typical, ranging from disinterested senior to pleasant, willing, smiling junior cabin staff. Services SVO-TSE-SVO on Airbus equipment with no IFE are similar with nice food, disruptive announcements and decent level of comfort. SVO is sprawling, transiting without visa is easy but you cannot linger between flights due to crowds and distance. Aeroflot was ok .... on time, with good food and comfort. The nonstop announcements and timing of meal services however are offputting and would cause me to look at other airline options.",,,,,
" Flew St Petersburg to Moscow via New Delhi. The flight was stalled for 2 hours without any announcements. Half the cabin crew failed to give any substantial reason. After 2 hours we were told to de-board as the flight is delayed for another hour because of a passenger who failed to board and his luggage was onboard. After creating an utter chaos of 15 minutes with people standing and removing cabin bags, another announcement was made that now the flight was ready to take off. There was absolutely no reason as to what was happening. I understand there is a reasonable language barrier but for an international carrier it is unacceptable. Will never recommend Aeroflot.",,,,,

 Washington DC to Moscow. Very pleased with this airline. In-flight food / service / entertainment was top notch and exceeded my expectations. The aircraft was also new with generous leg room. Thanks Aeroflot!,,,,,
"  Seoul to Minsk via Moscow. I had a booking that involved two airlines and three layovers, and when I came to check in in the city of origin, it turned out I needed a visa to make the first layover. A visa I didn't have. Aeroflot (the second airline) agreed to take my luggage from the first airline so that I wouldn't need to go through passport control and pick up my luggage and then check in again to continue my journey. I will never forget their kindness. Moreover, on the second leg of my journey I had a problem with my ticket (bought through the agent, not from the airline) and the manager Andrei in Seoul check in desk went the extra mile to call the agent on my behalf and try and solve the problem, and in the end helped me to buy a new ticket all the way being calm, supportive and professional. The more I fly Aeroflot, the more I feel secure that I will always be taken care of.",,,,,
"  Barnaul to Vienna via Moscow. It was the first routing on Aeroflot for me in many years and I was keen to see if and how their product has changed over time. I had flown the Route VIE-SVO-BAX a week before as well. All sectors were operated by Boeing 737-800 aircraft and the planes seemed to be in very good condition from outside and in the cabin. Leg room was very good for economy class, the flight attendants were helpful and service was done in a professional manner. On the flight from Moscow to Vienna several passengers who were influenced by alcohol already when they boarded became a nuisance to all others. They disturbed other guests  and started to threaten their neighbours after landing in Vienna. The crew did not react to this and even sold alcohol to them. This event had a negative impact to my personal feeling of safety.",,,,,
"  Moscow to Nalchik. I flew abroad with many foreign companies, but I never saw that the registration of passengers and baggage was so slow (my granddaughter and I stood in line for at least 50 minutes, despite the fact that the line was not so long). For all the time in the queue there was not a single announcement about the beginning or end of check-in for flights, which I initially did not pay attention to, but which probably played a decisive role in what happened. Having pre-registered online, I did not manage to check in my luggage until the end of registration. When it was my turn, they suggested that I fly without baggage. As a result, my granddaughter, 14 years old, who had no luggage, flew out alone, while I reissued a ticket at the ticket office the next day (August 8), for which I paid 5520 rubles. In addition to me, other people with similar stories crowded around the ticket office and they all asked the same questions: “Why don't they announce the end of registration? Why are company employees working so slowly?” I want to ask one more question: ""Why do the tickets indicate only the time of boarding the plane, but there is no time to complete the registration?"" I believe that a decent airline would return the money to me (I filed a complaint with the company), but Aerofot refused to do this. ",,,,,
"  I missed my connecting flight to Istanbul on sept 6th after a delayed flight from Los Angeles. I arrived at the boarding gate 21 minutes before departure time after a long security and passport control line but I was denied for boarding because the gate was already closed. The staff at the boarding gate was very unfriendly and did not help me and 5 other people who missed the same flight. All of us went to the ticket office and were forced to buy a new ticket. The penalty payment wasn’t even accepted and I had to pay additional 15157 Russian Rubel for the new boarding pass.  They told me that I can only complain on the website and request my money back. When I arrived in Istanbul, my luggage had been left in Moscow. Their only job was to get me into this connecting flight without additional fees and also not to leave my luggage in Moscow, but they did - my luggage finally arrived 2 days later in the evening. My porcelain vaze from Fort Lauderdale/America was broken and cost me about 152$. This trip with Aeroflot was a huge mistake and also a big disappointment.",,,,,
"  Vladivostok to Moscow. Very pleasant surprise, one of the best flights I've recently had. Aircraft was a bit dated but very comfy with a decent legroom. Being 6'3"" i didn't find it uncomfortable on 8 hours flight. The food is great, drinks selection could be better but nevertheless was OK. Toothbrush as well as slippers and eye-masks were provided which made the flight much better.",,,,,
  New York to Moscow. I paid extra for seats before our trip to Moscow. My selection was 18 G and 18 F for both flights. But we received boarding passes for 23 row seats instead of 18 row. 23 is a lavatory row. I paid for service which have not been provided. I contacted Aeroflot for refund but I didn't get any money back.,,,,,
"  Washington to Minsk via Moscow. As American citizens, you don’t need a visa to go to Belarus except if you fly to or from Russia. So we get to the airport, they tell us you can’t go. They didn’t want to help, rebook, provided no solutions. After 3 hours on the phone with the customer service, we rebooked and paid the change fees. Spend tons of money to get Russian and Belarus visa and fly out 2 weeks later. On the way back, the flight was delayed from Minsk to Moscow  which made us miss the connecting flight. they provided no solution to how we can get back home. Finally after fighting, they able to put us on a flight to miami. We had to pay extra for that as well and then we had to pay ourselves to go from Miami to dc. The experience was just unbelievable, never have we had such an atrocious experience and been treated the way we were.",,,,,
" Kazan to Lisbon via Moscow. The flight departed a bit late, but the passengers were kept informed. The first leg went just fine, with a snack for a 90 min flight. Departing from Moscow, the gate was changed some three times, terminal included. And that us not nice. Also, the flight was late, despite people being informed and the profuse apologies onboard. The service went well - more smiling needed! - as staff were attentive (a mother asked for help to put the socks on her baby and the attendant promptly did so). The food was not so good on the flight to Lisbon, but there were two options on Economy.",,,,,
" Another Aeroflot flight, another pleasant surprise: the check in is done early (so no need to rush and departure is in time), the service was fine (some more smiling would be grand) and we get a very good snack for a 90 min flight (chocolate included!).",,,,,
" Lisbon to Moscow. I was excited to try Aeroflot but had read some concerning reviews. This flight proved that Aeroflot offers very good service! We could choose from three options for breakfast and, trust me, it was delicious! The aircraft was just fine and the seats comfortable. The staff are nice but could chill and smile just a little more. Or maybe it is my approach to service. Also, if I check in online, having to wait on a long queue at the airport just to drop off doesn’t make much sense nowadays. The same goes for not having the boarding pass on the wallet but having to have it printed!",,,,,
"  Oslo to Bangkok via Moscow. Due to problems at the airport, we did not pass our flight on, and had to pay 550 Euro for a new flight that departed 24 hours after the original flight. We could not get out of the airport without paying 150 Euro for visas due Norwegian passports.  A lot of other passengers had the same problem and there was a very long queue where you had to stand for about 90 - 120 minutes before getting help since they had only had two people for this. When you arrive at Moscow airport the staff are on their cell phones rather than coming up with menus when you sit down at the restaurants, they do not smile at all and show that they are not interested in providing good customer care. This is my first time in Russia, and I hope I don't have to come back any time soon. HR

  Moscow to Athens. Aeroflot seems to be one of the very few remaining airlines to offer a real business class product with special seats in short haul flights. Service is refined (I was even offered a tablet with films downloaded ) and you really feel the difference compared to the usual slightly improved economy class product. All this at very competitive prices . Congratulations Aeroflot.,,,,,
  Long family flight with 9 month old baby. Great flight. Thank you very much for your excellent service and attention to infants! We flew with a baby from Madrid to Bangkok with a transfer in Moscow. At all stages the staff were friendly and very caring towards our kids. Docking time in Moscow was only 1 hr 20. In the transit zone we were actively driven up and let everyone forward among a huge crowd. Very carefully as all half asleep thought slowly. I want to note separately that the quality of food even in economy class is at a high level and not some kind of plastic like many airlines have. If coffee then only natural not instant and cheap Nescafe. Tasty tea. I often fly and I have something to compare. All kids are given packages with toys - this is very nice! When we flew from Moscow to Bangkok the stewardess herself offered to transfer to the free lane where there were no seats in front which turned out to be much more comfortable :) At all stages of the flight there were modern and comfortable aircraft. Clean and well maintained at a low cost. Aeroflot - you are just super!,,,,,
"  I traveled from New York to Tel Aviv in June 2019. We flew via Moscow and after two hours waiting transfer we took off to Tel avid, food and service is poor but I got economy tickets so it’s ok so far. In Tel avid is when the nightmares started, they can’t find our suitcases no where. 2 days later an Angel found 2 of the 3 packs. Well the Hunting continues, 2 more they my wife had to get in the baggage section in airport to get my mothers suitcase, finally we closed that chapter. June 17th was the day to return home, I had to return my rental car and left my family in the check in waiting, after I came back to the terminal we had to wait a half hour in line just to the attendant tells we missed the flight, I was 45 minutes to the depart, so we beg to them to let us go, no way, they sent us to the ticketing window where not one help us, the answer was, buy new tickets. I tried to see if any one else can help but looks like this company doesn’t have customer service.  We asked to talk to a supervisor but looks like they even don’t know that word or don’t care.

"  New York to Tel Aviv via Moscow in June 2019. Worst experience I've had with an airline. My flight from JFK to SVO, was continually delayed by Aeroflot without explanation. Even though the boarding time was never changed, we boarded over an hour late, then were told to get off after 80 minutes sitting on the plane without any sort of communication from Aeroflot staff about what was happening. They eventually claimed that they were trying to solve ""mechanical issues"" with the plane while we continued to sit on the plane. As I later heard airport staff commenting on, I have no idea why they boarded all of the passengers when they had clearly not solved the issue to begin with. To make matters worse, despite the flight taking off from New York (with many American and English-speaking passengers on board), most of the announcements were only made in Russian. After we got off, we were told that we would need to wait for up to 3 more hours to be notified about the status of our flight. We waited for almost 2 more hours before they canceled the flight - but, in fact, they did not admit to canceling the flight - instead, they claimed to have ""delayed"" the flight for a full 24 hours! Many passengers, myself included, were upset and frustrated, but this was not the end of the complete botching of this flight by Aeroflot. They seemed to have no planned response to this scenario. They herded us all upstairs to claim our luggage, and then had us wait in obscenely long lines to check in with two Aeroflot staff members  to claim an updated ticket for the 24-hour-delayed flight and/or a hotel voucher. After already being delayed for hours, we had to wait on these lines for at least an additional 1-2 hours. The worst part of this whole disaster was that Aeroflot claimed that they were not rebooking anyone's flight because the flight had not technically been canceled, it had been delayed (according to them). Most reasonable airlines release tickets once a flight has been canceled (as this one effectively had been, clearly) so that passengers can rebook on other flights, but Aeroflot was able to get around that by ""delaying"" the flight.  The staff that were handing out the new tickets and hotel vouchers were quite rude and displayed no sympathy for customers who had been treated so poorly by the airline already (I understand they were dealing with many angry customers, but they still could have at least apologized on the behalf of the airline, which they did not). Sure enough, even though I had a program in Tel Aviv that required my presence before the ""delayed"" flight's arrival, Aeroflot would not rebook my flight. I was lucky enough to have a travel agent for this trip, and they were able to demand that Aeroflot rebook my flight to another airline after a lot of frustration on their part, requiring me to rush to another airport after a whole night of no sleep. The entire experience was handled so poorly and unprofessionally from beginning to end that I will never fly with Aeroflot again.",,,,,
"  Madrid to Guangzhou via Moscow. I would just like to say that the way this airline schedules this flight is a recipe for stress and disaster. A friend of mine flew the same route and had the same thing happen to her. She had given me a heads up that I would have to go from one end of the Moscow airport to the next end in order to attempt to make my flight. She also warned me that my luggage would probably not arrive. She knew this as she had taken the same route two weeks before I did. The flight from Madrid to Moscow flight 2501 arrives at 5:50 PM at terminal D. Then you have to get though security to get to terminal F in order to take flight 220 which leaves at 7:05 PM from gate 57 at terminal F, which is the second to the last gate. I literally ran from one terminal to the next and then asked the security attendant if she could take me to the front of the line in order to make my flight. If I had not ran and had not asked to be taken to the front of the line I would have missed my flight. Once I arrived in Guangzhou, I was told my luggage did not arrive and would be delivered the next day. So, why have a route so tight that will cause passenger's luggage to always arrive a day late? If the airline is going to keep this schedule, they need to at least warn passengers that their luggage will arrive late and warn them that if they want to make their connecting flight they need to RUN to make it on board. Why not make the layover time a bit longer and avoid so many problems?",,,,,
  Amsterdam to Simferopol via Moscow. I would like to compliment and thank Aeroflot for their excellent services. Since I arrived with an international flight (SU2193 / SU2694) and continued my trip with a domestic one (SU1644 / SU1637) via Sheremetyevo Airport (and the new B terminal) I was quite worried about not receiving my luggage – which proved to be a needless worry. I also noticed stewards and stewardesses on the domestic planes had become more professional. The meals served were very welcome and tasty. (Aeroflot must be one of the few airline companies to date that still includes meals.),,,,,
"  Aeroflot economy class  Bangkok to Moscow July 18th 2019. As a Frequent Flyer (GoldMember) with Aeroflot for nearly 3 years, all I can say is that I'm very satisfied with them. Flight Attendants are genuinely welcoming and helpful, aircraft (usually Airbus) are recent, seats have a generous width & legroom (Frequent Flyers are entitled to a Space+ Seat with extra leg room, free of charge), food & wines onboard and in the business lounges are good and prices are overall competitive. You may sometimes have a flight delayed (snow at Moscow Airport in the winter, etc) - but I've experienced that Aeroflot will never let you down. They will provide drink, lunch, even hotel, and next available flight. A few months ago my flight from Bangkok to Paris was delayed, Aeroflot put me on the Thai Airways direct flight in the same day / evening and gave me a 4 star hotel + meals for the 8 hours waiting time. Moscow Airport is good, and has everything you need - restaurants, cafés, bars, hotels, wifi, vending machines. I had my luggage delayed - only once in 3 years - it was delivered to my door in Paris 48 hours later, free of charge to me. Overall a very good airline and I strongly recommend Aeroflot.",,,,,
"  Berlin to Delhi via Moscow. Will never fly Aeroflot again once this trip is completed. Traveling with 3 kids, they bumped me off my business class confirmed flight, without my consent and without a forwarding confirmed flight. 4 hours waited at the international ticketing desk, in an area with no water/food, with 3 young kids, since according to Russian law to enter the terminal you need to clear immigration and security. Requested/demanded to meet supervisor, was told by staff that they were in another building! Finally get into the terminal and then spend next 10 hours at another information desk in the terminal. With 3 kids this was absolutely one of the worst travel experiences, especially since I paid for business class to have the comfort. They finally put us up in one of the worst hotel rooms imaginable (available only at 10pm), with no ability to upgrade (since we were not in the ‘Russian section’ of the hotel). We were finally able to get out of Moscow the following day, 24hrs later. No response from Aeroflot customer service. Don’t expect one. Don’t think they care either. Just a piece of advice: shell out the extra $200 and get another airline into Delhi. You might end up wasting that money at their airport/hotel etc.",,,,,
"  Almaty to Copenhagen via Moscow. The plane(s) were fine, although there is no entertainment system, unless you download an app before you go, but I have never been able to get it to work because the language is always in Russian (there is a button for English, but it doesn't work), The food was awful, service was OK, but my luggage did not arrive for three days (and only just before I was leaving to fly to my next destination). I have flown Aeroflot 9 times between Almaty and Copenhagen via Moscow in the last 5 months and my luggage has arrived on the same flight I have arrived on less than 15% of the time. Furthermore, it often does not arrive for 48 hours, which is incredibly inconvenient. And on the Almaty end, I have to go to the airport myself (or get a courier) to pick it up. The service is simply atrocious.Moscow SVO airport is crowded and stressful to transit through with few good places to see for several hours. I have reached a point where I am going to try to avoid it if at all possible in the future.",,,,,
  We were traveling from Amsterdam to Phuket with stopover in Moscow Sheremetyevo which is a total mess. None of our 4 suitcases arrived at the final destination. We were crowding with a large group of travelers at the baggage claim desk at Phuket airport who had the same problem with Aeroflot. The staff was continuously smiling but that does not help. Aeroflot claims that they have a lost luggage tracking system but it doesn’t work. Calling customer support is pointless. I called like 20 times and I was every time disconnected while waiting on the line. The staff in Phuket promised to deliver bags tomorrow to our hotel. If that happens I will amend this rating but that is how the situation looks for now. Having all 4 bags lost for every member of the family is the worst nightmare that can happen to you while on your holidays. ,,,,,
"  New York to Istanbul via Moscow. The flight boarded late because they were overbooked. The flight itself was fine. But once we landed in Istanbul we realized two of our luggages were missing. After running around trying to find where it was they told us the luggages were still is Moscow but would not tell us when or how we would get it back, they told us to wait and it would be on another flight down to Istanbul but not which flight it would be on. I called Aeroflot no answer (keeps saying they’re helping others and to call back later) I emailed and no answer. I filed a claim and no answer. At this point I have no idea where my luggage is or when I’m going to get it back. ",,,,,
"  Belgrade to Delhi via Moscow. An overall positive experience. The first leg Belgrade-SVO had a 2 hours delay due to tech issues, and a replacement aircraft of the same type is sent. Delay on departure exactly 2 hours. We got a complimentary non-alcoholic refreshment on the airside at Belgrade. Seamless boarding. Served a tasty sandwich, a cookie, and an apple. My layover at Moscow was long, but the airport is full of amenities. Shortly prior boarding the flight to Delhi was switched from a jetway gate to a bus one, but the weather was not bad. Despite the A330-200 was full, the boarding speed was impressive. Most of travelers were Indians returning home, so it may have played a role, as I was among the very few required to show a visa to enter India. Plane is a bit old, but in good shape. Inflight entertainment is so slow and hard to navigate that is almost useless. Served a nice hot meal and later some Russian style pies. There were no delays on that flight.",,,,,
"  Last week my wife and son flew Aeroflot with a 1hr 20 min connection through Moscow Sheremetyevo. The flight from Almaty touched down in Moscow on time, but passengers had to wait 20 minutes for the terminal bus to arrive. The stewardess assured my wife that if the connecting flight was missed, ""they will give you seats on the next flight."" The plane was served by only one bus, so everyone had to wait for all passengers on the plane to disembark before the bus ever left for the terminal. Transit passengers in Terminal D must pass through a security and passport control check before entering the terminal. By the time my wife and son cleared the security check, the boarding gate for their connecting flight to JFK had closed. Nevertheless, they made all haste to the departure gate, hoping they would be allowed to board, but they were too late. Aeroflot agents told my wife that the missed connection was her fault and she would have to pay full fare for the onward journey, more than $1,700. My wife had only a little over $900 on her card. I transfered the money to my wife's card so she could buy her and my son's ticket. This kind of mistreatment goes far beyond bad customer service. ",,,,,
"  Moscow to Los Angeles. The ticket staff in Moscow were rude. We upgraded our ticket from economy to business class the day before our flight. We were told to come back the next day to have our boarding passes printed out. This was after waiting in line for an hour - with 30 minutes of that being with the ticket counter representative ignoring us. Our flight was scheduled to board at 11:20 am the next day, so at 8am we went to customer service and asked about getting our boarding passes printed. Again, we were met with staff who cared more about ignoring is then helping us. They told us to go to the gate at 11am, which we did, and it was chaos. When staff finally helped us they said business class was full. When we upgraded we were told there were 6 seats, so we would have had seats if they just printed our boarding passes when we asked the first time.",,,,,
"  Terrible experience. They managed to lose my bag and it’s been 4 days and I still don’t have my suitcase. I spent close to 3 hours waiting at the carousel then in line to the lost and found office (there were about 20 people from the same flight who didn’t get their bags), they gave me a piece of paper with the tracking number and their contact info. I tried to call the number many many times and nobody answers. I sent emails, no response. 4 days and I still don’t have my bag and have no information on where it might be or what to do next.  If something goes wrong you won’t be able to get in touch with them.",,,,,
"  Perm to New York via Moscow. In 4 days they managed to lose my baggage on the way to and from my destination. Connecting time in Sheremetyevo 3 hours. The telephone they provide on their website and via general hotline for lost baggage in Sheremetyevo are never answered. You get an automatic answer that everyone is busy and you should call later. I tried approximately 50 times in different times never succeeded. E-mails are not being answered. At the moment something goes wrong, nobody cares.",,,,,
"  Minsk to Amsterdam via Moscow. My luggage got delayed in Amsterdam. The handling agent (Menzies) had filled in a report, and they had no idea, what would be the compensation due, what could I claim etc. They only could suggest to check aeroflot.ru. No any comprehensible info on the www, so I called the client support for details, and they suggested to file a claim and see what happens, in 2 to 4 weeks, perhaps. I am really curious why Aeroflot needs the phone support at all. The flight itself was not too bad. Most problems came from the fact that Sheremetyevo airport is extremely poorly managed, so both during inbound and outbound flight we had spent a lot of time burning fuel in the air waiting for a vacant slot. Services and navigation in SVO are very inefficient as well, and a lot of artificial bottlenecks are created and carefully maintained (some were already when designing the buildings).",,,,,
"  I asked for water & was refused initially and given after 1 hr when all passengers were served. On landing, after waiting at belt for 45 mins for luggage, we got to know that luggage was not transferred from St. Petersburg flight to Moscow flight and it will take 2 days for luggage to reach us. We were given mobile no for queries and that number was kept switched off entire day. ",,,,,
  Lisbon to Hanoi via Moscow. A ridiculous scene in Moscow with a group of staff trying to measure and weigh luggage of passengers. I am on business class and have only one backpack and a roller bag. Only bought two pieces of duty free so the roller bag was expanded and could not put through their cage. They refused my boarding and rudely responded to my request to speak to someone.  I have flown them 6 times over the last 12 months and their cabin services are decent. Unfortunately their action today was so bad that I would avoid them from now on.,,,,,
"  Moscow to Los Angeles. Good flight. Left on time. Boarding was easily done and efficient. FA’s were very timely with drinks and meals. Meals were pretty basic with the required brown, hard bread but otherwise okay.",,,,,
  Shanghai to London via Moscow. The crew were about to bring out drinks when the turbulence stopped and were standing around for over an hour. I got up to speak to someone she advised that everything was ok there was just a lot of condensation from the air conditioning. I took my seat again and the captain told cabin crew to get in their seats due to turbulence. I found the lack of information from the captain ridiculous. Barely any announcements during the flight. Whereas some airlines even advise of the weather etc. I was sat between people who brought their own food and spat their food into their cups etc. When asked to move they weren’t 100% that I could as there was an entire row free near to the emergency exit however these were for premium members.  They dealt with the matter quite well in that in an hour they moved me further up the plane as luckily one of the premium members had agreed to switch to the empty row for me,,,,,
"  Aeroflot changed my schedule from a 2hr transfer to a 14hr transfer overnight in Moscow airport. They did not contact me to let me know about this change and it was only luck that I logged in to check my seat selection that i saw it. I called to cancel and refund, which took them 2 weeks to even initiate after I contacted them again to check the status and I am awaiting this refund. Poor communication and customer service.",,,,,
"  Gatwick to St. Petersburg. After years of having an extremely lax baggage policy, where they didn’t charge anything to check in the first bag, let excess kilos float through without comment, and never paid any attention to cabin bags, Aeroflot has done a complete U-turn. Now you have to pay for luggage in the hold (£36 per item) and they are applying zero tolerance for a few grams over and weighing hand-baggage, applying limits to the letter. My excess on the same amount of luggage I’ve travelled with for years came to £129, almost doubling the price of my ticket. It was extracted by the service staff, at times barely suppressing smiles. The baggage policy – or lack of one - was among the very few positives. I’ll be thinking long and hard when booking a flight to Russia next time.",,,,,
" My first flight in the itinerary AMS-SVO was delayed by 1 h due a malfunctioning aircraft (as I was told), so I missed in SVO my connection to ULN and was re-routed via PEK with Aeroflot SVO-PEC and Air China PEK-ULN. The flight SVO-PEK was 1 h late in PEK as well, and I was put in Beijing in a hotel for 24 h to wait for the next Air China flight. My visit to ULN was planned as 2 days long, so I requested an Aeroflot agent to send me back to AMS, as my trip had lost its purpose. The Aeroflot Agent in Beijing spoke very poor English, and he ignored my request without a reason provided, but recommended to call to Moscow during office hours in Moscow (it was 3 am in Moscow at the time of this conversation) and discuss this with people from central office. As long as it would be too late then, and because in my experience Aeroflot client support is useless and helpless, I went to the hotel (the hotel was very poor and in a very strange location, btw). Re. inflight experience. All the Aeroflot long haul cabins I was in (A330 for AMS-SVO and B777 for SVO-PEK) were tired, did not look very clean and chairs were not the best. In contrast, both B737 for ULN-SVO and A321 for SVO-AMS were brand new and clean. Meals were very decent on AMS-SVO-AMS, decent on ULN-SVO and very unimpressive on SVO-PEK, especially a weird plastic-packed cooky before the landing that was (I suspect) designed as a breakfast. In-flight entertainment systems were broken or not very responsive both in A330 and B777. Flight attendants are trying their best to be nice, but did not act very professionally.",,,,,
 Stockholm to Tokyo via Moscow. Great experience with hard working crew and great punctuality. Many people say Aeroflot are a fraud and that it’s a bad airline but these people are totally wrong since they have changed totally from their past and now it probably is the world’s most underrated airline company. The crew was amazingly polite and kind but the one of the only issues was the cabin temperature was too hot on the way home (Tokyo-Moscow) but at least they listened and did what they could to make it better unlike many other companies who would have totally ignored it. The food wasn’t the best either especially when the plane originated from Moscow but from Japan it was way way better. I would definitely recommend Aeroflot and would love to fly again with Aeroflot in the future!!,,,,,
" Malé to Zurich via Moscow and missed my connection flight. We arrived just 40 minutes late at Moscow where I was supposed to get my connection flight to Zurich. Usually staff will help you if there is little time to reach the next flight which you booked together as one ticket with the same airline. There was two counters with staff, apart from that, no one to find. By the time I could make someone talking to me, my flight already left and they didnt care about it and I was stuck with other passengers in the transfer area. They left me without information and a little food voucher I couldnt even afford proper food with. I started running around the airport, trying to find someone who could give me any information or at least a place to sleep. I waited for more than 5 hours at the airport until I managed to get information. I had to wait for 15 hours.",,,,,
" I flew from IAD to TLV via SVO on April 15th, arriving on April 16th. 2 out of the 4 bags I checked didn't make it (along with many other bags from other passengers that were all making claims at the same time that I was. It took 8 days to finally get my bags (my trip was only 12 days long). During those 8 days I sent emails, faxes and called the airline and lost baggage service (Q.A.S) multiple times and never received any responses. The only reply I got from them was due to a Facebook message I sent, which explained I need to contact the airline directly, not through their FB page. On April 24th I decided to go to the airport and look for my bags myself. They claimed my bags were not there, but I begged to check on my own and was finally allowed. Well, they were sitting right there in their storage room! It seems that when the bags finally made it on a flight, they had new tags put on - meaning the airline would have never found my bags, since they were searching for my old tag number. When no one claimed the bags, instead of searching their system to look for my claim, they issued a new claim to the case even though my name was on the baggage tag! Now, I flew back the same route arriving 4 days ago (TLV, SVO, IAD) and 3 of my 5 bags checked are missing! They claim it was due to a short stopover, but I had a 14 hour stopover! It is going to take 8 days for my bags to arrive as Aerolflot only has 1 flight a week that flies this route. ",,,,,
"  Hong Kong to Moscow. Old Boeing 777 (5 years old), seats are super tight, and the choice of movies available is quite limited. Food: lowest quality I have seen on a plane. They lost my luggage - what can happen - however, to receive it back I received phone calls at night (11.30pm). ",,,,,
"  Male to Moscow. The food was terrible for me, the blanket looked used and dirty. It was possible to use the entertainment only a lot of time after the take of and they give you the headphones later. The dinner was served a lot of time after the departure in and they take so much time to bring you the drinks that you already have finished to eat.",,,,,
  Delhi to Moscow. Flight left on time and reached on time. Seats hard but leg space good. Inflight entertainment was problematic to operate. Press something and something else comes up on the screen. No free alcohol served on this flight. Food served after an hour and a half after take off and meant to be breakfast was terrible and small portions of food. Next food an hour and a half before arrival. A small snack box. I will carry my own food with me from Moscow back to Delhi. Worse than a low cost airline.,,,,,
"  Phuket to Amsterdam via Moscow. I had chosen a day flight with a 1H20 connection in Moscow. But after online check-in i noticed the scheduled departure time had changed which eventually lead to a 14 hour delay. Ticket was booked 5 months in advance. Even as member of their frequent flyer program, I wasn't notified and there was no way for me knowing of this change until it was to late.",,,,,
  Only 1 check-in desk open for a full plane and impossible to check in online. Amazingly bad! Flight crew is friendly. Pilot flying into Milano on April 1st did a very bad landing.,,,,,
 It was an international flight and I received lousy food in bad condition. It's unbelievable that they don't offer a minimum service when the tickets are so expensive. Never again!,,,,,
"  Non-existent catering, lousy coffee, a glass of water in plastic elements, non-existent entertainment, and aircraft without USB chargers.  The chaotic checkin, and staff with rude appearances. El catering inexistente, un cafe malísimo, un vaso de agua en elementos de plástico, entretenimiento inexistente, y las aeronaves sin cargadores de USB. El chekin caotico, y personal con unas apariencias maleducados",,,,,
"  One of the best things about AR is that they tend (in my experience on 3 flights) to leave on time or early. Boarding by zones is usually enforced and it works; boarding starts early. Staff on board seem tired, are never well-groomed and generally bored. Friends / other staff seem to be upgraded to Business class regularly on board. Catering is very basic usually - example: ""Breakfast"" flight of 3.5 hours, leaving at 05:10 served a cup of still water and a small ""health"" bar. No options like other menu for sale items. Crew disappeared after service. Cabin baggage seems to have no item number control but is weighed rigorously. Free checked baggage allowance is 15kg, unlike most other carriers throughout the world, and carry-on is 8kg. This can be a trap for international guests who usually travel with around 23kg checked baggage allowance. Overweight is charged for on the spot.",,,,,
"  Worst experience with an airline, ever! Completed booking, completed payment with my bank and got forwarded back to a website that said ""error"". No confirmation, no tickets received but the money was gone. Called with customer service and got disconnected a total of 6 times while being on hold. When I finally did speak to someone, she informed me there was a booking with reservation number but something on their side went wrong with the payment. She gave me the reservation number and on their website I could find my flight details. But still no tickets. I had to e-mail the ventasonline department who would be able to provide me the tickets. The communication with ventasonline was pointless. They first told me my booking didn't exist and I should book a new flight. I showed them a print screen of my bank payment and the booking with the reservation number and then it all of a sudden did exist, they would write me back about a solution for the money or tickets but they never did. Called with customer service again and they would all say something different or that I had to call back in an hour so they would know more. Did that a total of 4 times when I just lost my patience and the only thing they told me I could do was write an official complaint. As a reply, I received an automated e-mail telling me to contact customer service, so basically super pointless and you're just going around in circles with no one knowing how to help you get either your money back OR give me the damned flight tickets. I always book direct with an airline so that this stuff doesn't happen, but Aerolineas Argentinas apparently doesn't care about their clients and actual customer service. It has been 3 weeks now since booking and still haven't received my money. They tried to make me book a new ticket before receiving the money back but of course I don't have any trust with them anymore so booked with another airline (Air France) and everything went fine. This was my first experience with Aerolineas Argentina and for sure my last. Will avoid flying with them at all costs. By the way, because I paid with credit card my money is safe. I got confirmation from my bank and credit card provider that I was in my right and would receive money back via them. But it's really just pathetic that it has to go like that.",,,,,
"  After paying over $6K for two business class seats for our honeymoon, we were first told we weren’t able to sit together and that it was our fault because we could have purchased seats ahead of time, even though we could not see anything via the Delta or AA websites that would allow us to change our seats or check in online (also what? We paid business so you mean to tell me there’s even more of a price for seat choice even when you can’t see it online?) Then after an hour and a half wait at the passport control security line (no one seemed to be working at all) an hour and a half delay they had flagged my wife’s boarding pass and made her - a business customer - wait until the entire plane boarded ahead of her before they would let her on the flight. She got on the plane crying. Then the flight attendant was rude about it. I am disgusted and we will never fly this airline again. It’s okay if you’d like to check a passenger again but when they pay for priority and you board the entire plane before them? You are disgraceful. You ruined the last day of our honeymoon and we are disgusted with Delta for connecting us with this airline.",,,,,
"  On 10 August 2022 we purchased refundable return airline tickets with Aerolineas Argentinas from Cordoba to Ushuaia the port of embarkation for a December Antarctic cruise, returning Ushuaia to El Calafate. Two weeks later the expedition company cancelled our cruise citing ship delays. We immediately cancelled our AA flight reservations. The airline confirmed a refund was due under the fare conditions and would be paid within 120 days in December 2022. After hours of follow-up effort and numerous late night communications via Messenger and Translation apps with service agents in South America and their service centre in Florida USA, no refund has been paid after 5 months. How can this airline sell, and charge extra for flexible/refundable tickets if they have no intention of honoring their fare conditions?",,,,,
"  After having traveled NYC to Buenos Aires and two other flights to Ushuaia and back to Buenos Aires, I can say that this is the worst airline I have ever flown. There was no way to contact them; I tried, and every time the phone disconnected. The trip to Buenos Aires was without any Wi-Fi, entertainment system, or way to recharge our devices. The staff had a distinct hands-off attitude and any requests were ignored. I was told they would reboot the entertainment system. Two hours later, they informed me that they still hadn't done this and never came back with further information. The staff were unfriendly and uncaring. I will not be using this company in the future.",,,,,
"  Check in was flawless, aircraft in very good condition but rather small for a three hour red eye flight; on other positive aspect, flight was scheduled for 0150 am but departed around 50 min ahead of time, which is not always desirable specially when People are meeting you at destination airport But what the heck, would you rather be late?",,,,,
"  I was flying red eye from Bogota to Montevideo with a connection in Buenos Aires and my flight was delayed over 5 hours. This caused me to sleep at the airport and have my connection rescheduled so that I not only arrive late at night to where I cannot check in to my reservation and more importantly I miss out on a valuable day of vacation. There was no staff at the airport when I arrived at the gate or anywhere beyond the checkpoint. And no one would show until 2.45am, which is 7 hours after I arrived. No one to help with their mistake. When staff did arrive I asked for any form of accommodation. Sleeping at airport? Nothing. An earlier connection? Nothing. Cancelation (I unfortunately have another couple flights with this airline) since now I only have 2 days in Montevideo? Nothing. Money or points? Nothing. There’s nothing they can do but pass me off to the next stop. This is my first and lasting impression with them and after my trip it will be my last time flying them.",,,,,
"  On a recent trip to Argentina, I flew with Aerolineas Argentinas several times on domestic trips. I was pleasantly surprised. The aircrafts were well maintained and all flights were on time.",,,,,
"  Absolutely disgraceful. The airline made us wait 2.5 hours in Madrid to issue our boarding passes. There is no business lounge. The service was generally unfriendly. Everything was an effort. No flat bed. The food came on a trolley and was most unappetizing. No menu printed and only two options. Poor presentation. When we arrived in Buenos Aires, we had to wait 1.25 hours with no announcement or explanation for our luggage. Our luggage was wet and clothes in luggage also wet. ",,,,,
"  A scheduling disaster. Five flights booked, all five were rescheduled. Not only that, but the rescheduling included connections that didn’t make sense anymore: first leg landing after the second leg departs, and with no further options during that day. First, they changed the first flight of five, and only offered to rebook that one for free (even though it affected the following 4) so I had to pay for the change of the following four flights myself. Then, as the dates approached they changed (multiple times) the remaining four flights, up to the point that my last flight is to a completely different city. I will avoid this airline at all costs whenever I have a choice. An embarrassment and a scam.",,,,,
" Awful customer service! I booked 5 flights with the airline. 1) Customer Service not responsive: I had to miss my 4th flight due to an unexpected situation. The airline allows change/cancellation if it is >1.30hour prior to the flight time - I have tried contacting the airline by calling and WhatsApp, no replies - I had no choice but to forego this booking and purchase a new ticket from a different airline. The WhatsApp reply came 12 hours later and did not even read the chat above. 2) Unclear policies - As a result of missing my 4th flight, the airline automatically removed my 5th flight from the system - The airline did not allow me to check in and I had wasted 1 extra hour in talking to the sales office. The sales office wouldn't issue a new ticket for me as it is ""impossible"" to fly today now, the earliest flight available is in 2 days which is unacceptable. 3) Awful service from staff - I complained ""how am I supposed to know?"" that they would remove my 5th flight because I missed my 4th one (they are 1.5 days apart), the staff responded ""now you know"" - The staff even scolded me for not arriving to the airport earlier.",,,,,
"  Having booked flight over a month in advance, they over sold the flight. Did not notify us until we were at the check in counter, 90min before the flight. Basically told us we would have to wait 8 hours and hopefully get the next flight. If you are thinking of booking with this airline please reconsider. For your own peace of mind. Customer service is not in their intentions, only taking your money. ",,,,,
"  Absolute disgrace. By far the most sketchy, unprofessional airline I ever dealt with. Flights canceled due to Covid.  Argentinean Airlines have disconnected all phones and no one ever replies on WhatsApp. I mean using a free app to communicate with customers - all you need to know about their level. I have received one reply saying that they have reimbursed me on November 30th. It's February and it's clear that that's a lie - I have not received a penny. By the way, I have paid for flexible ticket, so it was refundable regardless of the Covid situation. ",,,,,
"  By far the worst customer service I have ever experienced (basically there is none). One of these airlines where things are ok as long as there is no issue, otherwise you are in for a treat. Flight cancelled in April (no reason provided but covid would be the logical guess) and still no reimbursement or even reply to my many requests over the last 8 months. There is no number to contact the company, they only give you a WhatsApp number to call (no one answers) or ask you to do so on Facebook (and again they do not reply).",,,,,
" Buenos Aires to New York. My first and last international flight with this airline. Literally nothing about our experience approached business class standards for a full-service airline: inattentive and rude flight attendants who were absent for most of the 11-hour trip and routinely ignored call buttons; no preflight drinks or even water or hand towels; I had to ask for an amenity kit as the crew forgot to hand them out; they banned the use of the front lavatory claiming it was ""company policy"" and did not clean the two others very often. The onboard entertainment was non-existent and no one was watching any of the few movies offered. It gets even worse: the meal service was the worst I've ever had in business or first class on any airline. It came not on a plate but in an aluminium foil-wrapped tin container and was inedible. Our flight departed at 11:30 pm and they started meal service two hours later, which is unacceptable for passengers who want to eat and go to sleep. I'm a Diamond Medallion with Delta, so at least I got the miles, but Skyteam needs to seriously rethink having this airline as part of its alliance.",,,,,
"  Buenos Aires to Mendoza. We had booked several flights with Aerolineas Argentinas but me missed the first one due to a cancelled flight to Argentina (not Aerolineas Argentinas). So we missed that flight but bought a new ticket to our first destination. Did not think much of it until we were at the airport for our next destination. We were informed that since we missed the first flight, all our tickets were cancelled. To avoid this we could pay a fees for no-show and other penalties for a total of USD 688 per person. That is more then the tickets cost! There was no email that informed of this. The interest of ground staff to resolve this was zero. it more felt like extortion. It we at least got an email saying that since you missed your flight you have to confirm the rest of your tickets then we would have had a chance to at least avoid a very stressful situation. Our carefully planned vacation is shot. We are trying to get new tickets but will miss several of the planned activities. We are losing time (sitting at airports). We are losing lots of money (buying new ticket) but not Aerolineas Argentinas  again! Avoid if at all possible!",,,,,
" Santiago to Buenos Aires. Excellent. No problems at all. Will fly again. Great staff at both airport and plane crew, clean aircraft, comfortable seat for economy class flight departed on schedule and arrived 10 minutes before.",,,,,
"  COR - EZE (Buenos Aires). Our first and last flight with this airline on 12/06/2019. The flight was 2 hours late leaving Cordoba, with no reason given for the delay. We were not informed until after check in and the only information about the delay was on flight departure monitors in the departure lounge. In spite of having a long haul, international flight connection with Air France (a SKYTEAM partner airline) on arrival in Buenos Aires, Aerolineas staff showed no concern that we might miss the connection and when asked whether it was necessary to change terminal in Buenos Aires to make the connection gave erroneous information. (We were told it was necessary to change terminal when in fact it was not). On arrival in Buenos Aires we had 59 minutes to check which terminal our onward flight was departing from and make our connection. No assistance of any kind was given by Aerolineas staff. We made our connection but our luggage did not, inspite of being checked through to its final destination on check in. We understand that our luggage has followed on a later Aerolineas flight, via Madrid, but we have yet to receive it. We received an email on return home from Aerolineas Argentinas, sent on the same day of departure, 3 hours after the flight should have left Cordoba and actually at around the time of arrival in Buenos Aires. It declared that the flight departure time had been re-scheduled! In 35 years of international travel, I have never experienced such utterly brazen incompetence on the part of an airline carrier, whose flight attendants were unconcerned, utterly unhelpful and ignorant of international flight connection arrangements with a SKYTEAM airline partner. Of course, we will never book with this airline again and cannot recommend it in any way.",,,,,
"  I booked my trip via AMEX Web Site to travel from the US to Argentina for the 2019 eclipse. My name on the ticket defaulted to the name on the card using my initials of my first and middle name. I noticed this today, a full two weeks before my flight from the US to Argentina. AMEX and I called Aerolineas Argentinas to update the name on the ticket. The only option was to cancel the flight and rebook to update the name on the ticket. The replacement tickets was $2500 more than the original tickets $3300, plus no refund of any kind. I can't afford to pay another $5500. In addition now I have to cancel 2 more round trip flights that I had booked with Aerolineas Argentinas for domestic Argentina flights for a total of $1500 and I have cancel 7 nights of hotel bookings with no refunds. I'm out $5000 just because the airline could not update the name from initials to my name. Maybe all airlines are like this, but never did I think such a simple change would cause me such a loss. The Aerolineas Argentinas agent first hung up on the AMEX rep and when we called back we got a different rep who seemed to know of my situation and he was unapologetic and extremely rude. He said while I was on the phone that he refused to speak with me. ",,,,,
"  Horrible service, flight from Buenos Aires to Rio de Janeiro supposed to depart at 18:20 on the 31st May 2019 and it was delayed to 2:15am the next morning, more than 8 hours waiting and no one knows anything, gave us a voucher to eat in a poor place called La Churrasquita.

"  Buenos Aires to El Calafate. The flights were on time. We had a problem with a pilot strike on 30 April 2019, we had to pay for another night for hotel with no compensation. Airplanes were in good shape and clean. Seat were leather covered with good legroom. Inflight service for 3 hrs. 50 min flight was very basic. A cookie and a soft drink or water. In flight Personnel were friendly and professional. They offer upgrade action, but both times we did not accept our bid even though they had available seats. They were not great but were not bad either. Nice experience.",,,,,
"  Cordoba to Buenos Aires. Very professional staff, the plane was clean. Even better now that they are not charging a lot like they used to, and providing a great service.",,,,,
" Dubious business practices from Aerolineas Argentinas - avoid flying this airline. Booked premium economy class tickets and were granted 2x32 kg on the first flight, however on the ongoing flight they only granted us 15 kg and the above amount had to be paid extra at the Airport. Neither the Ticket nor the Boarding Pass states as accustomed to from other airlines the weight of the approved luggage. Aircrafts were very outdated and worn, Crew and ground staff unfriendly especially if you are not Argentinian. Skyteam should seriously think about if excluding this airline from their network.",,,,,
" You have two terrible choices for flying within Argentina. Latam is a disaster (I'll post more on them - it is truly the worst airline I have ever flown), but not too far behind is Aerolineas. No video, cramped seats, no food even for sale, no beer or wine for sale (this in a country where wine is everywhere). The plane looked and felt dated and worn. Service is indifferent. By contrast, we flew them many years ago where food and beer/wine was complimentary. They have made a decision to go cheap, and it shows in virtually all aspects of the experience of enduring their product. In the US, this would be like flying Spirit, or in Europe, this would be like flying Ryanair. Yes, it is that bad - and I am not prone to exaggeration. At least Spirit and Ryanair don't pretend to be full-service airlines. Aerolineas does, which makes this is even more infuriating. Like I said, virtually all the domestic routes in Argentina are via Latam and Aerolineas. On top of that, almost all the flights go through Buenos Aires city airport (which is actually quite nice). But that means you will have a layover if you are going from one city to another within Argentina that does not include BA. In summary, choosing between Latam and Aerolineas is like choosing between being waterboarded or electrocuted. Just pick the cheaper option, eat before boarding, and just endure this torture.",,,,,
" 
They were essentially no frills and provided the mere basics on a flight. Granted, on a 1 hour flight Air France provides a drink and a croissant or similar pastry, whereas only drinks are provided with the same flight time. For a three hour flight, only a snack mix packet was served. Check in is very fast, boarding passes printed almost immediately, but the lines are long and people seem to turn up very late for their flights often, which means a lot of queue cutting. Boarding is mostly a mess, but bearable. Compared to LATAM’s lines though, Aerolíneas’ lines are relatively short. The 737MAX I flew was amazing. The engines were extremely quiet and the windows were large and gave a great view. The seat is the same as China Airlines. Legroom reasonable for short flights. One thing I am critical about, is that overhead bin space is very scarce. People sometimes have to store stuff 3-5 rows in front or behind them. Flight attendants were such a mixed bag, some were extremely friendly and open for conversation, and some didn’t greet you. ",,,,,
"  Buenos Aires to Rio de Janeiro. Bad service. Asked to move to emergency row because the regular row is too tight for my size (1,93cm) and cause hurt to my legs. The answer was no because I have problems with my legs! Ridiculous. I frequently travel in the emergency row and I am fully capable. That discussion would not exist if they have normal space for legs.",,,,,
"  Buenos Aires to Rio Grande. When you enter a plane of aerolineas, you immediately fall on the reward of Trip, it gives confidence. Mistake, our 2 flights were incredible, both late (25 minutes for the first and 1:30 for the second), no information, we only warn you when the boarding time arrives, quietly.  Following the bad reviews on the forums, and the endless malfunction of the website, we decided to go to the Ushuaia agency to get info on our flight back which was currently nonexistent. ou arrive at check in and there are twenty people at the opening, count 10 to 15 minutes per person minimum. The flight: late, in a dirty plane, the hostesses jostle, splashes and the breakfast is served by running because it seems that it is already very late to do so and for good reason, we land almost at the same time. Add to that the difficulties to pay a ticket on the site, the total lack of communication (no response on any media available), that's a lot for the same company. In short, we are far from paradise.  Low-end company at a bargain price!  FR: Quand vous entrez dans un avion d'aerolineas, vous tombez de suite sur la récompense de Trip, ça donne confiance. Erreur, nos 2 vols ont été incroyables, les deux en retards (25 minutes pour le premiers et 1h30 pour le second), aucune information, on ne vous prévient qu'on moment où l'heure d'embarquement arrive, tranquillement. L'enregistrement est long, mais long, 40 minutes pour passer une trentaine de personnes. Suite aux mauvaises critiques sur les forums, et au dysfonctionnement sans fin du site internet, nous avons décidé de nous rendre dans l'agence d'Ushuaia pour avoir des infos sur notre vol de retour qui était pour l'instant inexistant... Bin alors là faut oublier, vous arrivez à l'agence et il y a une vingtaine de personnes à l'ouverture, comptez 10 à 15 minutes par personne minimum... Le vol : en retard, dans un avion sale, les hôtesses sont de vraies brutes, on vous bouscule, vous éclabousse et le petit-dej est servi en courant car il semblerait qu'il soit déjà très tard pour le faire et pour cause, on atterrit presque en même temps. Ajoutons à cela les difficultés pour payer un billet sur le site, l'absence totale de communication (aucune réponse sur aucun des medias dispos), cela fait beaucoup pour la même compagnie. Bref, on est loin du paradis.

"  Montevideo to Buenos Aires. Airline act as if it doesn't need any clients in every interaction with the customer. I finally managed to book a flight connecting through their hub in Aeroparque in Buenos Aires. The day before the flight, I managed to check in online after only the second attempt, for the system crashed only once. The bag drop, boarding and flight went reasonably smoothly. However, economy seats are small even for a 5'9"" person. In flight entertainment was non existent. On board catering options were bland for a 3 hour plus flight. Connecting in Aeroparque, the international connections terminal is more like a holding pen for tourists with a duty free. Dull uncomfortable seats and one catering option with plenty of microwaveable foodstuffs. Second flight went smoothly, pretty quick hop. On the way back, something I have never seen on any airline belonging to an alliance happened: upon trying to ship a box of fragile items, which I have done numerous times in the past with several airlines (even low costs), the check in personnel refused to do so claiming the airline did not ship fragile items. In the end I had to rearrange the fragile items inside my hand luggage and ship it, and carry a card box full of garments that I had to take out of the bag through two flights and an overnight stay at the airport, all while expecting the worst to my luggage. Fortunately, a rigid bag and smart packing with clothes assured the items arrived in an almost intact state. Never again.",,,,,
  El Calafate to Ushuaia. We are on a 28-day South America Tour from Australia totalling 15 flights ( 13 with Latam and 2 with air Argentina) and the Latham tickets stated 23kg by 2 pieces baggge per person while the Air Argentina tickets stated one piece without specifying the weight. My wife and I had one piece each of 21kg and no carry on luggage. At check in counter today we were told that the limit per person was 15kg so we must pay 1300 Pesos ( approx 40 USD) and the bags went straight onto the conveyor belt without allowing us to reduce the weight by carrying on some items. We have travelled extensively two to three trips each year and never had a 15kg limit. The airline should have specified the limit if it was below the norm and offered the passenger the option of carry on if over limit at check in. This action was blatantly robbery and deserved to be named and shamed.,,,,,
"  San Luis to Buenos Aires. Avoid this airline!  Flights from San Luis to Buenos Aires were cancelled throughout the day blaming ""meteorologic conditions"", even though there was nothing unusual and flights were flying everywhere else with no problem. Customers were advised about the cancellations just minutes before the flight departure (via email), leaving everyone in limbo. When calling customer centre, they were very rude, and said that the tickets did not qualify for reimbursement, only could be rescheduled for another day. Of course, they wouldn't pay accommodation or anything else either. When trying to discuss options with them, they simply hang up. Finally, many passengers opted to take the bus and claim the money later on (good luck with the claim, anyway). Unfortunately, they have the monopoly of many flight routes in the country and there is no competition, so they charge whatever they like for a very poor service. They not only cancel flights with no notice, half of the time there is a strike or some other reason to leave people stranded. Fly this airline at your own risk",,,,,
"  Asuncion to Aeroparque Buenos Aires. This was a return section and my travelling with Aerolineas after some years. I've read some bad press and I recall long haul on dilapidated 747's and 737s 10 years ago. This was a short 1.5 hr flight but international never the less. I require assistance now and this airline provided it with care to attention and in a dignified manner. Check in is good, you receive an email 24 hours prior ""looking forward to seeing you"" and even a slightly overweight bag was checked in with a wink. How contrasting to my recent Norwegian experience at LGW. Nice clean plane, welcoming well groomed cabin crew along with a standard seating plan. Basic but complementary snack served by very pleasant crew who didn't seem to struggle with English. On time and disembarking with assistance well managed. A thumbs up and now tempted to return to Aerolineas for my next long haul from Europe to South America.",,,,,
"  Ushuaia to Puerto Iguazu via Cordoba. I booked three domestic flights with Aerolineas Argentinas and two were on the regional Austral. The flights were closer to being on time than I experienced with other airlines down here, and basically everything went off without problems. The Austral flights were actually better - the Embraer planes are more comfortable and roomy than Aerolineas Argentinas 737s (which looked new but were a bit cramped) and the Embraer seats even have small entertainment screens (can be hard to get earphones though). You get snacks on longer flights, just a drink on shorter flights, and it might be a regional norm that no alcohol is available.",,,,,
" Flew Aerolineas from Buenos Aires to Iguazu. One of the most dysfunctional organisations I've ever had to deal with. There is clearly no one who is capable of running a customer focused business who works at this airline. The call centre staff were rude and continuously put me through to a disconnect line. The website forms say 72 hour turnaround times, and no replies are received. I have flown countless airlines worldwide, this is by a very long way, the worst. I would not recommend this airline to people I didn't like, let alone anyone I did.",,,,,
"  Buenos Aires to El Calfate. My initial flight with the company was okay, if nothing to write home or review about; however my attempted trip back was horrible. The flight was cancelled. I received only a notice the late night before with no explanation. I had no way of getting information as it was a weekend and they do not have weekend hours. When I went to the airport I was informed there were no flights due to a strike. Now while this may have effected more than one airline they did not offer a refund or remedy, or even an apology or sympathy for their clients. I was one of the lucky ones that got in before they left at 2 pm and basically every other passengers had to learn via word of mouth why and how long (5 days before reschedule) they had to wait. Basically swarms of people waiting for information. At the very least there should be an email and apology, truly there should be a refund.",,,,,
"  I flew Aerolineas on a two week trip with my family from JFK --> Buenos Aires --> Bariloche --> Mendoza --> Buenos Aires --> JFK. I was always a little annoyed with them. I waited on the phone for 30 minutes the day before my flight to reserve seats for the flights and when I showed up to the airport they had no record of my phone call (even though I had gotten an email with seat confirmation) and they had already given away our seats. Given that we had an international flight on our itinerary, we were entitled to two checked bags for each of our flight legs, and every single time they tried to charge us and we had to remind them that we got two free bags - I think they were trying to dupe us. What was most frustrating was that they cancelled our flight home with just over 24 hours advance notice because of a ""technical difficulty"" with the plane, and instead of having the direct flight from Buenos Aires to JFK that we paid for, they re-booked us (after 1 hour on hold) on a flight to New Jersey. I had a connection from JFK to Boston that I obviously missed, and ended up having to pay for another very expensive flight. I filed a claim and never heard back. I called once to follow up and after 45 minutes on hold I was promised that all claims were addressed within 22 days. 22 days came and went and I never heard back again. I made four additional follow-up phone calls, and each time I was on hold from anywhere from 10 to 45 minutes before I could speak to someone. Every person I spoke to gave a different explanation - from this is the wrong phone number to claims take 2 months (not 22 days) to call Expedia. When I finally started asking to speak to supervisors, two times I was actually hung up on. It is ridiculous that I paid for a flight to JFK, they cancelled it, offered me a flight to another airport, and when I declined, I can't get my money back. I fly a lot, and this airline is the worst I've come across.",,,,,
" Flew with this airline three times domestically within Argentina in November 2017. On the first of these flights, I managed to miss my flight after not hearing the announcement of a late change in the boarding gate. Totally my fault, but Aerolineas put me on the next flight straight away with no extra charge. So had a good first impression of them. The staff all had decent English (which can be rare in Argentina), the interior of the planes are very spacious when compared with what I'm used to from European airlines and the in-flight services were great. Only downside is that the air-fares are higher for non-Argentinian citizens. But that's a common trend in the country. Overall, very happy with them.",,,,,
"  Miami to Buenos Aires. Flights on time, food quite good , fresh and tasteful , great service, planes very clean. Entertainment system up-to-date. Only problem : seats are flat-incline which is old fashioned. But airfare was about half of the other competitors. Return trip just as good. Would certainly fly with them again.",,,,,
"  Vast improvement compared to my last experience some years ago. Used Aerolineas Argentinas as a 'feeder' from/to AEP (which is so much more convenient than EZE for my needs) to connect with my Swiss (Edelweiss actually) flights from/to GIG. No complaints whatsoever, brand new, clean planes and enjoyable service both on the ground and in the air. Complementary catering absolutely sufficient for a 3 hour flight with 2 ham/cheese sandwiches, soft drinks and coffee on offer. The only inconvenience was that my reservation number (ticket issued by Lufthansa) wasn't recognized by AR, hence I was unable to make online check-in and reserve seats for the GIG-AEP leg upfront. However, it did work for the return flight once I obtained the locator/PNR code. Overall a good experience and an option I will again take into consideration for my next trip.",,,,,
  Flew Mendoza to Aeroparque with Aerolineas. Our flight left on time and on a brand-new and very clean airplane. The flight attendants were friendly and the flight uneventful. Only non-alcoholic beverages are served for free which was ok given fair price we paid for the tickets. I would recommend them.,,,,,
  Flew Aerolineas from Aeroparque to Puerto Iguazu. A rather good experience. Aeroparque airport is becoming to small for the amount of traffic and hence was rather crammed. The plane looked brand-new and was very clean. Liked the pilots' announcements. In-flight the entire plane sang a cumpleaños feliz. Flight attendants were friendly with one exception. Flight was uneventful. They serve only drinks for free which was no problem given the low fare. I would recommend them.,,,,,
"  Flew Buenos Aires to Miami. Has to be the worse product flying from South America to the US. Here's why: Product - dated angle-flat seats on a 2-2-2 set up. Most seats were worn out and clearly hadn't been cleaned in a while. Amenity kit very basic and neither the bag or products were branded (vs Coke Hann on AA, Tumi on Delta, Ferragamo on LATAM etc) Food - much less than basic. On the return I was better off having a quick meal at the airport than on the plane. Service - here's my major concern, if I'm paying a lot for business class, I expect friendly service and attention to detail. Anything I wanted I had to ask for it, they would take my glass of wine while they were still half empty and wouldn't ask if I wanted a refill. I had my food tray done for a long time before they picked up Entertainment - basic, ~30 movies (most of them old or Argentinian films). Forget about noise cancelling headphones. Overall impression: I would definitely avoid Aeroloneas as much as I could. I decided to fly with them since I'm a Delta Diamond and wanted to get them miles and Delta only has an overnight flight from ATL to EZE This airline is way overdue for a makeover. Unfortunately, it's government-owned so probably not a chance of any improvements any time soon.",,,,,
  Cordoba to El Calafate via Buenos Aires. The worst kind of service I could expect from an airline.  We were on a flight from Cordoba to El Calafate via Buenos Aires with a one hour layover in Buenos Aires. First our original flight from Cordoba got canceled (airline's fault) and we were put on a flight which was 40 mins later. This would've meant us missing out on our connection. But when we landed our connecting flight also got delayed by 50 mins. Now the ground staff still refuses to check us in on our original connection with atleast an hour to spare for our original flight to depart. I don't think I will ever fly Aerolineas Argentinas again.,,,,,
"  Buenos Aires to Iguazu return. This company is by far one of the worst I flew with. Service is quite low (nothing is served on the plane at all, no food not even water). Planes are not the newest and comfort is pretty limited. Also, our flight was cancelled last minute because of a strike but no information was given to us until the day before. The first plane to fly back to Buenos aires was 4 days later and it was too late for us. We had to take some bus to go back and the company litterally refused to pay us back for the inconvenience saying that they couldn't prevent the strike. Definitely we recommand to fly other companies in Argentina such as Latam with better service, better planes for the same price.",,,,,
"  All four legs were right on time. The seating was fine. The A330 out of JFK has angled lie flat seats, which are obviously not the latest and best but which I always find perfectly adequate. The domestic flights were on brand new Embraers with 1x2 seating and ample pitch. Based on this experience, the airline seems to have the basics really pulled together. The only disappointment was the catering. Dinner on the way down was served sloppily (congealed olive oil, no s&p, cling wrap on the dishes) and really unappetizing. And what's with the generic and generically tasting ""red or white?"" wine service? Shouldn't the flagship airline of this wonderful wine country take some pride and feature the best of their production? But I don't fly to eat (and I didn't on the way back), there is pre-departure sustenance in the lounge (though not in AR's own lounge at EZE) and the fares are good. So overall, a reasonable experience.",,,,,
"  Buenos Aires (AEP) to Rio de Janeiro in March 2016. Nice flight, check-in very good. Professional and pleasant desk service. Flight departed and arrived on schedule, the flight was very quiet, cabin staff were polite, friendly and professional. The waiting for luggage was a little slow. Nonstop flight and highly recommended. ",,,,,
"  El Calafate to Buenos Aires. We have had several flights with Aerolineas Argentinas. All of them were terrible but I'm going to start reviewing just this last one. We arrived earlier at the airport think we could probably take an earlier flight. Once at the desk of Aerolineas they told us we will have to pay for the change a fee and they told us the fee will be 413 pesos (around $27) which we agreed. They moved us to a different desk to pay and after waiting 30 minutes they told us that the fee was 2800 pesos (around $180) per person. When we said the other person said a different amount they said that this person did a mistake. They had 4 flights before ours and they couldn't have the small gesture of moving to any of them for a reasonable amount. I called the company asking for customer service and they said they don't have customer service. We also did business class from Miami to Buenos Aires with them. I have never seen a dirtiest seat. The tv didn't work, jumping the movies from minute 10 to 30 or stopping.",,,,,
"  Buenos Aires to London via Rome. I have flown business class in many airlines and this was my first time with Aerolineas Argentinas. The aircraft was modern and business class was average with room for improvement; main issue was that the seats are not fully flat. Food was as expected and the crew were friendly and helpful. Business lounge in Buenos Aires was below average. The one supplied in Rome by Alitalia was superior. Outbound, they left one of my bags in Rome but arrived the following day and a zip was damaged which was very promptly and efficiently repaired at no cost. On the way back it felt like a child care facility with four seemingly unaccompanied children two of whom were visited by a member of the cabin - this type of freebie does not go down well when we have paid a full fee. On the whole, underwhelming but with a bit of more professionalism, it could be up there with the best.",,,,,
"  Buenos Aires to Ushuaia via Trelew. Worst flight experience ever had. Strongly discourage any traveller to travel with such an unprofessional airline as Aerolineas Argentinas. We arrived to Buenos Aires at 11pm and that same evening the airline cancelled our 7am flight due to a staff strike the next day. No additional information, no re-routing, no support. Nothing to help international passengers. The next day we spent 8 hours in a queue to get a new flight and were sent o another airport, one hour away from the EZE. Again four hours queue to be put on a waiting list that never provided a flight. After 24 hours waiting, all on our expenses, we were sent directly to Ushuaia (instead of Trelew), lost flights, hotels and car rental, with ZERO compensation. We will certainly avoid Aerolineas Argentinas for their lack of professionalism and mistreatment of clients.",,,,,
" A very nice flight with Aerolinas Argentinas from Buenos Aires Aeroparque to Santiago in a brand new aircraft. Very nice seating, good service, sandwich and cold and hot drinks served during the flight. Departure and arrival on time smooth flight. Hope to be on board again soon.",,,,,
" Buenos Aires Jorge Newbery to Mar del Plata. The punctuality was excellent, the flight departed at the scheduled time. The plane was in excellent condition considering its age since it is a very old plane. The food service is very poor, not a proper service for a passenger who pays the most expensive ticket. The attention of the crew was excellent. The Skypriority service was not very good since my suitcase was last in the airport tape of arrival and in Aeroparque there is no priority queue in the security control.  La puntualidad fue excelente, el vuelo salió a la hora prevista. El avión se encontraba en excelentes condiciones y mas considerando su edad ya que es un avión muy viejo. El servicio de comidas es muy pobre, no es un servicio adecuado para un pasajero que paga el boleto mas caro. La atención de la tripulación fue excelente. El servicio Skypriority no fue del todo bueno ya que mi valija salió ultima en la cinta del aeropuerto de llegada y en Aeroparque no hay fila de prioridad en el control de seguridad.",,,,,
"  Buenos Aires to Ushuaia. Aerolineas Argentinas workforce went on strike on 19DEC and suspended activities in the morning until midday; this was not the airline's fault but the airline did not do anything at all to assist the passengers manage the situation before, within or after the event. Just the night before this strike, the airline sent an email confirming flight departure date/time, knowing that the flight would be cancelled due to the strike. At the airport the airline did not provide any support at all to the thousands of passengers affected. All the information provided was that we needed to wait until 1pm to find out what was going to happen with our flights. The airport was a mess of people everywhere. At 1pm when the staff returned to work, all passengers were told to call a toll-free number to get support, no staff at the airport offered to help passengers at all; the toll-free number was congested with calls and there was an automated message asking people to call again the next day - how is that possible when people had flights to take to get back home or to reach a destination where hotels or other items had already been paid. The only reason why we were helped was that we complain so much and remained at the check-in window requesting somebody to help us with our flights, we had to ignore the negative treatment by some of the staff and their management and just held our position until someone decided to help us and put us on a flight - we arrived to our destinations after losing 1 day on our holiday; and upon our return discovered that after that whole situation Aerolineas Argentinas cancelled our return flights which had nothing to do with the original flights impacted by the strike. Once again we found ourselves at the Ushuaia airport being told we had no flights, having to deal with very poor attitude from the airline staff at the check-in counters, but repeated our behaviour as on the first flight and told the staff we would not move until somebody helped us as we had nothing to do with the cancellation of our flights. Finally, a manager agreed to put us an a waitlist and we were lucky to fly back to Buenos Aires. I would not fly Aerolineas Argentinas ever again if I can avoid it; and I have recommended all my relatives and friends to do the same.",,,,,
"  Buenos Aires to Florianopolis. There had been a transport strike in the morning, no flights until noon. I arrived at the airport three hours before the 6pm flight. Utter pandemonium and chaos. No staff to direct the thousands of stranded passengers nor the ones with confirmed flights. Over two hours to checkin. Disgraceful. The flight itself was okay. It was 40 minutes late departing, but that seems to be normal for Aerolineas Argentinas. Service minimal, Only good thing was that the baggage arrived at the terminal before the passengers, who were bussed from the plane.",,,,,
"Booked in September for a December 4-7 Buenos Aires to Ushuaia return thru FlightNetwork.  Discovered two weeks later that my flight from USH-EZE was cancelled and cancelled by the airline. Contacted Aerolineas Argentina via their facebook admin with no help but they told me to contact FlightNetwork directly to fix our tickets. After several calls to FlightNetwork and emails our tickets finally got fixed to fly 7th December USH to AEP (Original flight with the same airline was USH-EZE) 7th Dec also happened to be the airline's birthday. Flights went well and were punctual. Plane interiors on my flights were very well maintained. There was the wifi logo at the entrance/ exterior of both planes but there was no such service. For a flight over 3 hours long. They only served normal beverages and cookies. On their birthday, they served an extra but very thin ham and cheese sandwich. Even the bread was sliced thinly. Check-in was functional. 15kg check-in luggage for domestic flights. Pay an additional 150 Argentinian pesos if you luggage exceeds 17kg and up to 23kg. If you exceed 23kg to 30kg, you pay 400 pesos one-way.",,,,,
"What started as a very pleasant trip with Aerolineas Argentinas, ended up becoming one of the most bothersome long haul flights I have ever experienced. I flew from Rio de Janeiro to New York with a long stopover in Buenos Aires and a switch of airports in that city. Rio de Janeiro to Buenos Aires (Aeroparque): Aircraft used was a fairly new Boeing 737-800, flight was on time, crew was friendly, decent leg room and the food provided to us was very good (nice sandwich with a traditional argentine alfajor cake) and a good choice of beverages. Nothing really to complain about this flight. Buenos Aires (Ezeiza) to New York (JFK): Aircraft used was a brand new Airbus 330-200. Very modern plane with LED ambience lighting, good entertainment screens with a good selection of movies and music. Sounds great so far right? Well, the downfall begins with the amount of leg room Aerolineas Argentinas have on this plane. I take long haul flights at least 3 times a year and have had experiences with various airlines but I have never seen a plane with such little space as this one. It was really uncomfortable the whole time because of the limited leg room (I am 1,79 cm). Unlike my other flight on this trip with Aerolineas, the food served for dinner was horrible, I didn't eat it at all, worst food I have ever seen on a long haul flight and I heard other passengers complaining about it as well. Breakfast was decent but still overall very disappointed. Crew was uncaring and only offered water during the meal service; not a single time did they pass around the cabin offering water to passengers. My final thoughts? Regional and medium distance flights, Aerolineas does a pretty good job. Stay away from their Long Haul flights though.",,,,,
  Santiago to New York via Buenos Aires with Aerolineas Argentinas. Terrible experience. The flight attendants were rude and not helpful. The seat was small and extremely difficult to sleep in for even a few hours. Worse than the actual flight was the online booking experience. When I landed in NYC I had to transfer to Newark and I didn't realize that in the booking process. So I had to pay $31 to take a bus to another airport after I already landed in JFK. I called Aerolineas to ask for help and I had maybe the single worst customer service rep I've ever dealt with.  Aerolineas Argentinas is terrible. Would never recommend.,,,,,
New York to Sao Paulo via Buenos Aires. The most narrow seat I have ever seen. My knees came touching tHe seat in front of me during the whole 10 hour plus flight. FA's in a bad mood. Food was just ok but the breakfast was awful. The only good thing I have to tell about them is that the flight was on time and my baggage (which inlcuded a big fragile box) got to destintation without any problems.,,,,,
" Aerolineas Argentinas from Iguazu to Buenos Aires. Abruptly cancelled my flight with no proper notification and no assistance to passengers. Although the disruption was just over 4 hours it caused chaos at the small airport. No notification at the airport was given in English and so some passengers were unaware of what was going on. Staff at the airport initially said the delay could be up to 48 hours. No refreshments were offered and e-mails to the company resulted in their company policy being quoted, basically saying its not their responsibility.",,,,,
"  Flew Buenos Aires Aeroparque to Santiago de Chile with Aerolineas Argentinas; to use up some of my Air France miles. Tried to check-in for my flight from Buenos Aires on their web site, which didn’t work, probably because my reservation code was that of Air France and not Aerolineas Argentinas. When calling Aerolineas Argentinas, in order to find out the reservation code I should use for making the check-in on-line, after a very long wait I ended up talking with the most rude agent I’ve ever encountered. According to her I should have never called AR for this matter since I hadn’t used them for my initial booking. Furthermore, she accused me several times during the call for interrupting her, when I simply tried to explain to her that all I wanted to know was the reservation code that they must have for my reservation in their system. She kept on repeating that she does not work for Air France and eventually, she just hang up! So far so good for Skyteam! Worried about what may be next, I arrived at the airport two hours before departure, to find a nearly empty check-in line. So far, so good! Boarding took place relatively easily, bearing in mind we're in Argentina although by a single bus for a full B-737. Once airborne, a sandwich box and coffee/soft drinks were offered, but of course one shouldn’t ask for beer or wine (despite being a country producing so many great wines), as all you get is a disapproving reply from the cabin crew stating that they don’t serve them on “regional” flights. Well, if their region extends to flights over two hours, I wonder, who made up that policy! At least, landed in time in Santiagio!",,,,,
  Rosario to Buenos Aires with Aerolineas Argentinas.  The service is good. Catering consists on a cookie and a juice. Enterntainment is reasonable for the duration of the flight. Seats are also reasonable for regional flights. Service not outstanding but clearly above average. Priority services are OK given that Aerolineas uses Sky Priority rules,,,,,
"  I recently flew from Bogotá to Buenos Aires and back on Aerolineas Argentinas. I was not sure what to expect, because reviews are very mixed. Both stretches were flown on their A340. On the outbound route, the seats were very old/outdated, although reasonably comfortable. The in-flight system was very limited with just 4 movies and not the best. On the inbound flight we had a different plane and the seats looked much better, although overall they were the same type, but the video screens were much larger. There was also a bigger choice in movies. On both flights the cabin crew was very attentive and pleasant. The meals, although quite abundant, were mediocre in taste, and in both cases, something or the other was forgotten (like the dressing). Bread was cold and/or stale. My biggest point of criticism was the check-in. I had a carry-on weighing 12.3 kilos. First at the counter in Bogotá they made a big fuss over size, but this particular TUMI bag does fit maximum accepted standards. They insisted I fit it in the thing to measure it and when they saw for themselves it did meet size requirements, they insisted to weigh it and told me to either take out the 2.3 kilos or have it checked. This when on Copa and Avianca they let me take it in on board in Economy, no questions asked, and this was business! On the inbound flight they had 3 counters in Buenos Aires with SkyPriority signs, but all 3 were unstaffed. The last check-in agent just walked away with leaving passengers in the SkyPriority line without saying anything. When I complained to the girl who did check me in at an economy counter, she said I had arrived just during a schedule change (how weird!). All in all it was a mixed bag with the actual flight a much better experience than the experience on the ground. To me their way of dealing with business class passenger in the check-in procedure leave much (!) to be desired. They did not treat us special, on the contrary. It was fussy to say the least.",,,,,
"A domestic Aerolineas Argentinas flight from Puerto Iguazu to Buenos Aires (Aeroparque). The scheduled time of depart was 9:20AM. As we arrived to the airport, no one told us that there is a delay and we were after check-in and security. Finally, we left the small airport at 12:40pm after more than 3 hours of waiting then the excepted. Plane was Boeing 737-700 with easyjet seats which were OK. The snack box was okay and decent for the 1 hour and 45 mins of the flight. Aeroparque's terminal is very nice, clean and comfortable. Next time I will think twice to fly with Aerolineas Argentinas.",,,,,
"Trelew to Buenos Aires. I was surprised by the good service. I wanted to pay for extra kilo's of luggage since the maximum is 15kgs for an inbound flight and I will fly intercontinental later on. My suitcase was 18kgs but the ground stewardess told me that I don't have to pay for it, 18kgs is no problem at all.  I reserved a window seat (5F) and when I came to that place, only 5D was available. My neighbor was a crying baby. In that moment I thought that this was going to be a worse flight. Then a man came to me if I wanted to change seats because he was the father of the crying baby. So: yes please. Still no window seat and I tried to explain that it was rude to take my windowseat, but I don't think he understood. I didn't expect food and drink service for a 1:50hr flight, but they offered us lovely cookies and a drink. Good job for this airline!",,,,,
"Buenos Aires to Miami. I have flown Aerolineas Argentinas 10 years ago, and I I was not looking forward to this trip, but since my friends bought it, I was forced to join. To my surprise the airplane was new, excellent condition and even had entertainment. I think it was way better than my Iberia from Madrid to Buenos Aires. The food was very good, I had beef, which is no surprise when you think it's an Argentinian airline. Also wine was great and the crew was professional and efficient. They seemed to be very happy with their job. Entertainment was great on the A330 but not that great on the A340. Of course they are not Emirates or Qatar, but I am overall pleased with this airline.",,,,,
"Rosario to Barcelona via Buenos Aires with Aerolineas Argentinas. Horrible airplane, no plug in for the laptop. Unacceptable in Business Class. Food was horrible, awful croissant and roll, not eatable. Business class seats old, not possible to lay flat completely. It was possible to sleep, therefore with this respect ok. No Airshow, it was frozen after 30 minutes flight and it wasn't reset, even after flight attendants were notified. No chance to know where we are.",,,,,
"Flew with some friends from Buenos Aires to Iguazu and back in late october with Aerolineas Argentinas. Very good service, specially the cabin crew was very polite and nice and I was surprised by their fluency in german. The flight was comfortable, in time and snacks given was quite abundant for such a short trip. I really can't complain about anything.",,,,,
"Buenos Aires Aeroparque to Mar Del Plata on 17th November, a 6:45am flight actually on Austral E-190. Weather was bad and lightning delayed many flights. Aerolineas Argentinas agents at the gates are either super nice or super awful. The screen says ""see agent"" for the flight, and the agents don't know anything. Finally after 3 hours they assign our gate and we board by bus and stairs in the pouring rain. Nice Austral E-190 - love these planes. Good knee-room. In-seat video, not a great selection but for the short domestic flights its fine. Flight attendants were all smiles. AR ground service is always bad,   but their in-flight service is usually good. Arrived after 40 minute flight - bags off quick in the small terminal. Arrived safe so that is key.",,,,,
"Our Aerolineas Argentinas flight Cordoba-Buenos Aires was canceled during our check in for the first leg in Rosario, the “compensation” was to travel in a cramped taxi with no luggage space, had to carry bags on our laps for 5 hours, to Buenos Aires. We have had no reply to refund request, by what others said, this seems to be usual with Aerolineas Argentinas. Will never fly with them again.",,,,,
"My flight to Buenos Aires was not full, plenty of room to stretch. Flight to Miami was full because of school vacation, big mistake on my part. The A330 is uncomfortable in economy. When the seat in front of you is reclined, you have the tray table pitted against you stomach, even if you are not fat. The flight attendants should ask everyone to sit upright when serving meals on the A330. Rows are so close that it is impossible to get up from your seat normally. One must slide to the end and climb out. I have flown this aircraft before and they are all the same in Economy - horrible. Considering how packed the flight was, the flight attendants were excellent. The food was mediocre with two choices: pasta or beef, and very small servings. Flight attendants provided drinks generously and water service was available throughout the flight. Bathrooms were kept fairly clean. Movie selection was very good, free headphones were provided. A very uncomfortable aircraft, avoid the A330 Economy. Only seats that looked spacious were the exit row seats. Check-in at EZE was smooth despite crowds and airport chaos.",,,,,
"Flight was delayed 1 hr due to late arrival from Buenos Aires. I used Alitalia Lounge in Terminal 3, modern, large, with limited food options (salads, sandwiches, desserts). I was one of the first to board the plane, so I had to wait almost 30 mins to get any drink/welcome drink, without asking for it, FAs started to give drinks only after boarding was finished. Seat was ok, not full flat, but quite comfy. IFE very poor, only 5 channels available, showing only 2 movies in Spanish/English version, no Air Show with a map available, so had no idea about flight time etc. Cabin crew were nice and smiling, quite senior and during breakfast service, looking very tired and grumpy. Disappointing menu - I was expecting some local dishes from Argentina, some beef etc, and I got green salad with parma ham, risotto or pork with ratatuille or ravioli. I tried first two - all tasted the same, bland, boring, over cooked. No cocktail service at all, as only whisky is available. Good wines. Service in business class is very old fashioned, reminds me service from the 90s, nothing modern as for plating, food presentation, menu etc. Dirty toilet in Business Class. Breakfast started 2 hrs before landing, again - boring tray with fruit salad, yoghurt, bread roll and almost shapeless croissaint, jam and hot omlet with... carrots. Horrible. Generally, very poor business class product. No PA from pilots for whole flight. Not recommended.",,,,,
AEP-MTV short 30 min flight. Check in at aeroparque was fast no lines for security line. Boarding by bus 20 min delay no explanation given. Once on board nice FA nice service and arrival nearly on time. Bags short on belt. Good option on this route.,,,,,
Flight BHI-AEP-BHI August 2014 with Aerolineas Argentinas. A domestic flight both of only 1 hour. Crew were friendly and polite. Catering service was just OK. Aircraft were old but still comfortable (both B737). Both flights on time.,,,,,
I was very disappointed with Aerolineas Argentinas. The seats are very uncomfortable they do not have enough space between them vertically. My husband is 6 feet tall and his legs were touching the front seat he had no space to move them. I am 5'5 and was also uncomfortable. It was a long flight almost 9 hours and the TV screens did not function properly. Mine had no image whatsoever. My husband's screen had image but no sound. No entertainment at all for almost 9 hours is ridiculous. We had to take a second flight from Buenos Aires to Bahia Blanca and the flight was delayed 2 hours. On our return from Buenos Aires to Miami the flight was also delayed this time for 1 hour. Even tough the prices of Aerolineas Argentinas are lower I would never use it again or recommended to anybody. I have taken the same flight route with American Airlines and LAN and they are much better. Next time I rather pay more for the tickets and have a more pleasant and comfortable flight.,,,,,
"AR 1303 April 23rd and AR 1302 April 26th. We were looking for a reasonable Business Class fare from Miami to Buenos Aires we were amazed at how much less expensive Aerolineas was than the other carriers that we checked and were worried that it might be due to an inferior flight experience but decided that since were only flying down for three days to attend a wedding he had to go for it. Well I'm happy to report that with Aerolineas Argentinas you don't ""get what you pay for"" you get much more. The plane we took was an elderly Airbus that was a bit tattered (especially the bathrooms) but the seats were lie-flat and comfortable the food was above average (much better than American) and the flight attendants were cheerful professional and happy to help with a smile unlike the surly overweight lazy tenured FAs on most U.S. legacy carriers. I would fly Aerolineas again.",,,,,
We flew business class (club condor) from JFK on Feb 21 and returned on Feb 28. Great experience. Airbus 330-200 was clean and comfortable. Both flights left on time. Crews were first-rate. Great bargain. Highly recommend it.,,,,,
"We flew on A330 EZE-JFK-EZE seats are too closed to each other I'm 5 9 tall and had problems with my legs this is what happen when airlines prefer only profit instead of customer service + profit EZE-JFK was 1 hour delayed and JFK-EZE 45mins delayed. Ground staff in both airports terrible neither courteous nor willing to help you. My greatest concern is flight attendants: most of the cabin crew and I mean 90% were rude they got angry if you requested a glass of water or soda (even though you walk to the aft galley to do so). During dinner one female flight attendant offered me chicken or pasta I asked her what kind of pasta and sauce she told me: ""sir I'm not the chef who cooked the meals"".",,,,,
Picked flight based on price. Flight from Miami to Buenos Aires was delayed by 6 hours and then canceled until the next day due to mechanical problem with plane. Re-booked on flight the next day. Luggage did not arrive in Buenos Aires for four days. Return flight delayed by 3+ hours resulting in missed connection. (All flights including connections on Delta were booked through Aerolineas Argentinas.) No help from Miami staff re-booking connection on partner? Delta. Ground staff in Miami sent us to the Delta counter to figure it out for ourselves. Delta would not rebook without us paying for new flight ourselves. Went back to Aerolineas Argentinas counter to find them closed until that evenings flight. Ended up renting car and driving 13 hours home.,,,,,
December 22nd 2014. MSP-JFK-EZE-FTE. Flew Club Condor. Others in our party of 5 flew coach. We had the full Monty flying Aerolineas. But the staff handled us well. Flight out left on time but no accommodations for Sky Priority passengers. Charge the gate at JFK was more like it. The food was very good. Service is prompt in that every flight attendant worked to get the job done so they could disappear. We liked how they gave us 3 options for our meals. The ice cream for desert and/or cheese plate were fantastic. And it is true they don't offer mixed drinks. For water they gave us a bottle for the over night flight. Breakfast was again very prompt well presented and the crew when prompted did go the extra step. On the return our child's vegetarian meal was missing. The crew promptly reviewed the menu and told us additional items we could choose from. For the return our flight was changed to add a stop at BRC. At which time we were notified our return to JFK was delayed from 11 pm to 6 am. Sky Priority line did nothing to help us here. We had to suffer with the rest. However they did rebook our last segment with Delta for us and effectively communicated to the crew in JFK to assist us and they did! They offered us a hotel and dinner in EZE. As we missed our JFK connection back to MSP they put us up in NYC and paid for dinner there as well. We turned down the offer for the hotel room in EZE and were able to sleep in the Club Condor Lounge. This is easily better than most First Class Lounges I have seen. Aerolineas in my opinion did much more than Delta United or American would have done for us. Our kids got to spend time touring NYC for the night. Our only downside was the plane could have been cleaner. Sad for a new A330-200. Here the domestic carriers do a better job. For the price we paid on for the ticket and what we got it was well worth it. When this airline makes mistakes they make up for it.,,,,,
Flew four times over the course of a month internally around Argentina (EZE-El Calafate El Calafate-Trelew Trelew-EZE EZE-Iguazu) and was very happy with service. Check in was prompt and staff were friendly and bilingual. Never experienced any delays in fact we were actually moved forward from a 6 hour change at EZE to a flight departing 5 hours sooner for no extra charge. Snacks and drinks served in all flights and despite the 737-7 seats being noticeably more cramped and less comfortable than the -800 I'd certainly recommend.,,,,,
EZE-JFK. The flight was supposed to leave at 11pm. A maintenance issue on the plane but the airline did not announce a delay / cancellation until the boarding time. First the departure time was delayed to midnight and then to 2am. Finally at 1:45am they announced that flight was cancelled. Passport control was closed. Also there were no baggage claim staff. Aerolineas Argentinas decided to reschedule the flight to 6:10am (7+ hour delay vs. original time). After changing the gate and the plane the boarding started at 6.45am and flight left at 7:30am. This airline is terrible. They don't care at all about service.,,,,,
I flew with a friend on the 3 December in Club Economy from Buenos Aires to Bariloche with a return booking for 9 December. The aircraft was a brand new Boeing 737-800 and the 2 by 2 sets in the forward Club Economy very comfortable and done in soft leather. A small snack was served by very friendly cabin staff and all was well until the beverage cart rolled by and we asked for some Malbec wine and were told that Aerolineas do not serve wine on domestic flights! One can imagine my surprise that after paying USD $992 per ticket that the flag carrier of Argentina which grows some of the world's finest wines does not showcase this product onboard-they did not even give us the option to purchase wine on a two hour flight! We will be returning to Buenos Aires on LAN.,,,,,
For this short 100 min flight from Mendoza to Buenos Aires the economy seat on the 737-700 had plenty leg room and they even served a small lunch box which impressed me. Just beware that row 6 which was behind me has no window. I would not want to be in that seat!,,,,,
Flew on Oct 21st from Ezeiza to Miami on AR 1304. Equipment was Airbus 330-200. Traveled in Business Class (Seat 5d) Check in service was very friendly and efficient. Business class lounge was spacious and comfortable and serviced by attentive staff. Boarding was very good and through a separate jet way from other cabin. Welcome on board was very friendly and helpful. Seats are flat but at an angle; very uncomfortable and I kept on sliding downwards. Inflight entertainment was good in terms of equipment but mediocre as far as programming both audio and video. Unfortunately the only WC in business class was out of order so we had to use filthy economy class lavatories. Not good.,,,,,
I flew from JFK to EZE on October 2/14. The flight left on time and arrived on time. I travelled in Club Condor. The service was friendly and efficient. New A330 aircraft. The Club Condor seat was an inclined flat seat. I found the seat to be hard and the angle for sleep was not comfortable. I put the seat into a cradle configuration and was able to relax more and sleep for several hours. The food needs improvement - presentation taste and variety were all lacking and considering the price paid to sit upfront I expected better. The entertainment system was good. There were a lot of movies to chose from. There were several places to charge my devices. I would fly with Aerolineas again.,,,,,
I flew MIA-EZE-MIA round trip on Aerolineas Argentinas (AeroA) December 24 2013 returning January 7 2014. I bought the ticket online but their website is not set up to allow you to select your seat. So I called their 800 number in the US. I called for 3 days several times each day before someone answered the phone. This agent's English was so bad it took 20 minutes to select my seats. EZE airport check-in at Buenos Aires is chaos. On AeroA all passengers for the MIA flight stood in a single line to be checked-in for only that flight. The same for other flights. We found this out by asking other passengers what to do as there were no AeroA employees or announcement boards present. There were long long lines of passengers snaking through the terminal. Check-in was so slow we were concerned we would miss our flight even though we arrived 2 hours early. It didn't matter though because our flight was delayed 3 hours on a crystal-clear morning. When we arrived at MIA 3 hours late the AeroA gate agents had gone home and there was no one to help us with rebooking our connections to Chicago. The planes both ways were run-down and old on the inside. On the way down a ceiling panel rattled the entire 9 hours. The entertainment system did not work either direction. The flight attendants only appeared 4 times in 9 hours: to serve drinks after takeoff to serve and collect dinner serve and collect breakfast and hand out immigration and customs forms. My advice: 1) Do not fly Aerolineas Argentinas for any reason even if you have to change your travel plans to avoid them or pay more on another airline. 2) If you are unlucky enough to use them and have to fly out of Buenos Aires EZE airport arrive 3 hours early and prepare for the slowest and most disorganized check-in procedure you have ever experienced. 3) If you do not speak Spanish then you will receive only limited customer service on the phone and their web site is primitive. 4) Prepare yourself for old tatty airplanes with no working entertainment system and largely-invisible flight attendants.,,,,,
Travelled from Madrid to Buenos Aires in May as the starting point of my South-American holidays. Reasonable prices and a remarkably good service all along the flight. There was a wide range of food to choose including delightful Argentinean beef. Check-in was fast and simple and the flight had no delays at all.,,,,,
Montevideo-Aeroparque-Asunción. I have to say that there is an improvement in the service. Still there are delays and poor customer service on the ground. But on board there are new and comfortable planes and nice and attentive FA. Connecting in Aeroparque (Buenos Aires city airport) is always fast and easy. First leg delayed connection on time. Bags arrived at my destination with me.,,,,,
I always fly American Airlines first class in my trip JFK-EZE-JFK. I decided to try the business class (club condor) with Aerolineas Argentinas. I regret to says that the business class of American Airlines is much better. The seat at the club condor are ok not flat bed but ok. We were welcomed with orange juice a cheap champagne and candies. The menu says only one appetizer (no choice) and 3 main courses. Two options are for the breakfast time. The whole experience with the catering was horrible. From the presentation to the quality the food did not respond to a business class. Do not expect to have any cocktails since they only have wine beer and whisky. The dessert was a piece of rock (ice cream) and we received hard croissant and bread in our breakfast. The returning flight did not even have all three dinner options and the food was horrible as well. I wonder how do they plan to compete with such a horrible presentation. They do not provide you with the custom forms for USA.,,,,,
Even though Aerolineas Argentinas has received too many complaints from customers recently my flight from Sao Paulo Brazil to Buenos Aires Argentina on March 1 2014 in Premium Economy Class was great and I have no complaints. The flight was on schedule the flight crew were polite and helpful. Aerolineas Argentinas' premium economy class is the same as most US companies' domestic first class. The seats are J seats very comfortable and the food in this class was also a great sandwich yoghurt and a chocolate muffin. Compared to service in the same route provided by Brazilian companies I have flown and comparing also the price Aerolineas Argentinas Premium Economy class is far better in service and mainly in seat comfort!,,,,,
MIA-EZE and return Dec. 24 2013 - Jan. 3 2014. A below-average airline. Their website is so primitive it is impossible to reserve seats. Their toll-free number is not manned 24 hours a day astonishing. On our plane to Buenos Aires none of the in-flight video worked for the entire flight. There was a loose panel in the ceiling over an aisle and it rattled the whole 9 hours. The food was mediocre even by airline standards. The flight attendants were businesslike but disinterested. The plane was only about 1/2 full but the FA's were often nowhere to be seen. Our flight back was 3 hours late leaving EZE after a chaotic check-in at the filthy Ezezia airport. At Ezezia you do not stand in one line for all flights and go to the next available agent. Instead there are separate lines for each flight no indication of which line you should stand in and the agents appear when they feel like it. There was no explanation for the delay and no apologies. If you have any other option for flying between the US and Argentina I would take it.,,,,,
Rio to Buenos Aires AEP on 737. Departure delayed by 30min and arrival to AEP slightly behind schedule. Plane in good condition (must say that the new livery looks better than the old one). Sandwich and drink offered during flight. Crew fine. AEP is easy to navigate. Luggage (priority tagged as FB Elite) arrived fairly quickly and first on band. Was dreading flying AR but flight was overall fine. Planning to fly them long haul in C class from Spain in May.,,,,,
SYD-EZE on 29/10/2013 and returned EZE-SYD on 22/01/2014. The check-in at Sydney was slow and inefficient. There is no online check-in option for this flight and no seats are allocated prior to check-in so though you should only need to be there 2/3 hours before for an international flight I actually was told to get there 4 hours before just to get a decent seat and even then I queued for nearly an hour to check-in. Boarding was smooth and uneventful. The plane was clean but old. The in-flight entertainment system is horrendous. Considering this is a 15 hour direct flight there is no seat-back entertainment system. There is one large monitor at the front of the cabin and a few smaller ones spaces sporadically. The picture quality is terrible obviously no option to select subtitles if you are not a Spanish speaker. The movies were the same two films on repeat for the 15 hours. Nothing else. The food was adequate though the ran out of some food options leaving my companion to eat vegetarian or nothing else. Obviously the wine is good - it's Argentinean - but the drinks are just served with meals. If you press your call button it is ignored and switched off. I gave up trying to get some water. Breakfast was terrible none of it was edible. Flying back EZE-SYD was not much better. Check-in was a little easier and fortunately this time I managed to get a window seat. Upon boarding I discovered the plane was not full so I had two seats to myself. The only good thing to happen on this flight. The food was just as bad the availability or lack thereof of drinks was the same as before. The toilets were filthy and were obviously not checked or cleaned during the flight. The call-buttons were again ignored. The entertainment system was the same again this time they showed two English language films with Spanish subtitles a slight improvement but still the same on repeat for 15 hours. I would not recommend Aerolineas economy to anyone.,,,,,
AEP-MDZ MDZ-AEP in a new embraer. Really satisfied with the service. A small beverage offered with some 'alfajores' to eat. Nice trip in both ways and both legs on time. Really impressed by improvement of Aerolineas compared with its competitors in Europe. Small entertainment offered with Argentinean music videos and TV shows. Fantastic.,,,,,
AR 2467 from Mendoza to BA on 17/02. Several flights in last 3 weeks. Flights late no information staff unhelpful and couldn't even be bothered to clear the cabin. Missed one connection and took three attempts to get anyone to rebook it. Our luggage went without us. Thought Vietnam Airlines were bad but AA could teach them a thing or two!,,,,,
I took 3 domestic flights (Aeroparque-Salta Menodza-Bariloche in Y and Bariloche-Aeroparque in C-Class) with Aerolineas Argentinas in the last 3 weeks. Each flight was leaving and arriving on time the crew were nice though not all of the crew members spoke English. The snacks as well as the drinks offered were rather boring but free of charge. The planes were comfortable enough for the short flights especially the brand new Embraer of Air Austral with IFE in each seat were great!,,,,,
Took 4 flights in Jan: SYD-EZE - no dramas other than ordinary food and lack of entertainment (a tiny central screen that is off color and barely able to hear the audio on my headphones) on a 15.5 hr flight. EZE-FTE - they changed the airport 8 hours before the flight (from EZE to AEP ) luckily I arrived early and they put me on a bus to the other airport. Delayed 30min. FTE-EZE - delayed 3 hours apparently because of storms in BA that morning but I had a 1630 flight and they never managed to catch up. EZE-SYD - delayed 16 hours initially for heavy rain in BA then they needed fresh crew then the new crew arrived late then missed curfew at Sydney airport. We waited at the airport and departure times kept getting pushed back. Missed my domestic connection but was able to rebooked the next day. At least the airport has free Wi-Fi. Staff do not care and were not helpful will never fly them again!,,,,,
Flew to Buenos Aires from Sydney in early January and back in late January. The flight from Sydney started with one hour delay and arrived before scheduled time due to fortunate conditions. Inflight entertainment was on a central screen 2 movies ok. The food was not great but reasonable for economy. I had to change my flight by 2 days going back Aerolineas made that very expensive for me. The return flight was very poorly organised. Check in was extremely slow with unnecessary delays. Subsequently the take off was delayed 2.5 hours without explanation. The flight itself was uneventful with the aircraft arriving 3.5 hours late. Movies on board were the same as on the flight to BA and were repeated. Meals were minimal. No drinks were offered in between meals.,,,,,
On Dec 18th we left Miami at 7 pm for Buenos Aires. Average flight nothing special. Arrived in Buenos Aires at 5.30 am and went to our assigned gate at the domestic terminal. We were booked on Flight 1880 to Ushuaia that was to leave at 7.45 am (12/19/13) giving 30 hours to catch our 3pm (12/20/13) Antarctic cruise. Fl 1880 was postponed to 8.50 then to 10.30 without explanation. Then told the flight would leave at 3 pm. The flight didn't leave at 3.00 we were then told 8.30pm. What happened at 8.30 pm the postponed time for the scheduled flight is something out of a movie. We were never told that the flight was cancelled we were just told the flight would not be taking off. 2 hours later we were transported by bus out to the tarmac to board our plane to Ushuaia. After stopping at Trelow and taking on more passengers we were scheduled to arrive in Ushuaia about 2 am on 12/20. Landed at a small airport. The captain then for the first time announced that we were in El Calafete instead of Ushuaia. In the early morning hours of the 20th we are waiting in an unscheduled airport not knowing when or if we would arrive in Ushuaia. 2 hours later we board a plane and much to our relief we arrived in Ushuaia at 6am. Needless to say we did arrive at our cruise on time but we had one change of clothes to last us a whole 8 day cruise. We were never offered an explanation for the postponed and cancelled flights and then were diverted to a different airport without warning or explanation. We will never travel this Airlines again.,,,,,
Dramatic improvement - would use them again. They have obviously spent a lot of money over the past 3 years on new planes with in-flight entertainment. Service was friendly and our flights on time (AEP-SCL).,,,,,
"  Guadalajara to Puerto Vallarta. Never again will I fly with this airline! The plane was so small and super hot inside. My seatbelt didn’t work as they are supposed too. Cabin staff just don’t care for customers! Just a horrible airline, never again will I use it.",,,,,
"  Puerto Vallarta to Guadalajara. Scheduled for 17:15, first delay 18:00, then 18:30, then 18:50. No staff and no explanation. Now the screen reads Viva aerobus to Puebla at 19:00. Still no staff and still no explanation. I will never use this airline again.",,,,,
"  Puerto Escondido to Mexico City. Aeromar is usually my airline of choice. On this day they were more than 2 hours late. So by the time I landed at Mexico City, got off the plane, got my luggage and got to the ticket counter of Aeromexico, my next flight was taking off towards Los Angeles. I thought that Aeromexico / Delta would just put me on the next flight. First, they made me visit different ticket counters which took another 45 minutes and at the end said that they couldn't do anything about it and I would have to buy a whole new ticket. The first ticket that I bought online cost me about $125 usd, but now this new ticket to LA cost me almost $300 usd. After I bought my ticket, went to the Aeromar ticket counter, which was in total disarray, and tried to talk with the supervisor. He gave me an email to write to and sent me on my way. Since then I wrote them twice and have received discouraging emails. Yesterday it took me two hours on the phone with them, going through 3 levels of management for them to give me a ""courtesy flight"" worth $80 usd and I still have to pay the tax. I ask them what would of happened if my whole family was with me, we would have spent $3,000 usd? He said that there is nothing that they could do, so much for customer service. So that is why I think I will never fly with them again.  In the old days we had no choice, but now there are 3 more airlines here in Puerto. There it is guys, the reason why I might never fly with Aeromar again.",,,,,
  Oaxaca to Mexico City . I have never experienced such bad customer service. People had been in line for over 2 hours. Only 1 desk agent. Instead of calling people up front for the flight that was going to depart he checked in people for the flight after. Then gave us boarding tickets when the plane was already gone. People waited for 2 hours to find out what to do next. This airline is a joke! We got booked on a flight the next morning resulting in a loss of paid hotel in Mexico city. When we arrived the next morning there were again 50 angry people in line waiting for a flight that Aeromar cancelled and didn't tell anyone. When we finally got on the plane multiple people had the same seat number. It was ridiculous and unprofessional.,,,,,
"  I paid $365 for a direct flight from Oaxaca to Tuxtla Gutierrez in Mexico. This airlines baited and switched me by canceling the direct flight and they changed the ticket to Aeromexico with connecting flights and a longer trip that I can now by for $158. They would not refund the flight and i unfortunately booked it with Priceline (who has the worst customer service in the known universe), so I received no assistance whatsoever and options that were not properly explained to me. When I phoned Aeromar, I was greeted by a completely rude agent who was less than helpful. I would strongly advise against booking anything with this airlines. ",,,,,
"  Ixtapa Zihuatanejo to Acapulco via Mexico City. My 17-yr old daughter had the misfortune to come in contact with Aeromar and the lack of services while she was on route to Acapulco, on December 23, 2017. She had two connecting flights with Aeromar Airlinesone which was delayed and caused her to missed her final flight to Acapulco. The flight that was delayed was Flight 522. This flight from Ixtapa, to Mexico City was delayed fourty minutes and therefore, she arrived late to her gate to board flight 907, to her final destination, which was Acapulco. She was denied boarding, and there was no help from anyone from Aeromar, after whoch was not permitted to board. My 17-yr old, started her holidays stranded in a foreign country, in a busy airport and just left to her demise. I tried contacting the airline, no one answered, I contact which tried to get in touch with costumer service, and the booking agent, was not able as well. What is disgusting, is that not a single of the airline personnel working that night, offered to help, my daughter was just turned away and you did not care, specially, since it was the airline's fault in the first place that she missed her flight. My daughter had a panic attack, was afraid, and I had to sort all this out from Canada. To my misfortune, I had to buy, yet another ticket from Aeromar, for the next day, as well as find accommodations for the night. The travel agency which helped me book this trip, has made numerous attempts to resolve this, and nothing has been resolved yet.",,,,,
"  Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo to Mexico City. Once more a delayed flight, just three hours but without any guarantee. Just ""we hope that more or less at 4pm we will have a plane"". Incompetent and unfriendly staff, truly the bad side of Mexico, just the image the country does not want to give. Everybody here gives you the impression that they want you out of their face and expect you to be thankful that there might be a flight after all. Which is not yet secured.",,,,,
Puerto Escondido to Mexico City on Aeromar. Small plane and we left about 30 minutes late. Plane was not full and just one stewardess working the flight. The plane appeared to be new. It was in excellent condition in the cabin. Service was excellent but it was very expensive for a flight of less the two hours.,,,,,
"Fly 10 or 12 times a year Mexico City to Ciudad Victoria. Planes are small Fokker Turboprops. Always very friendly staff and have been on time. Seats are rather small, an excellent lounge with drinks and snacks at a number of airports. Service onboard with snacks and drinks are adequate.",,,,,
" I booked them through Chase Travel Portal. Unfortunately, I missed my initial flight from LAX to Mexico City due to a check in error. I checked in on the Aeromexico app, and received my seats AND the boarding passes. I get to the airport and Aeromexico said I didn't check in and explained that I had seats 11D and 11E, but was unable to pull up the boarding passes on the app because it was too late already. An Aeromexico employee put my girlfriend and I on a standby list and after 8 hours, we were able to get on a flight to Mexico City. Upon speaking with numerous amounts of Aeromexico agents and Chase Travel agents, I was guaranteed a flight back since I did take a standby flight from Aeromexico. I wanted to confirm once I landed whether this was true, and unfortunately, Aeromexico said it wasn't the case and that I would have to buy a whole new ticket. I contacted their customer support and I haven't received anything regarding that. I had to pay $800+ just to get a last minute flight back to LAX. Aeromexico is absolute trash and I saw this with no respect what so ever. I review places on Yelp all the time and I NEVER give a bad review, but Aeromexico wants me to be stranded in Mexico City without giving me a flight back home.",,,,,
" When I purchased flights, for an additional fee I was offered a more flexible option for changing flight dates. I took the inbound flight, then thought to return a week later than planned. When I tried to use it, the change fee was more than the round ticket itself. I went to the airline website and purchading an one-way ticket was even cheaper than changing the date. In my case I wasted money for a ""flexible"" ticket.",,,,,
" If you ever consider flying with Aeromexico, I strongly advise against it. In my personal experience, this airline has demonstrated a lack of professionalism and reliability. One of the major issues I encountered is their frequent changes in flight areas without providing sufficient means for passengers to stay informed. The availability of screens displaying these changes is limited, and there is a notable absence of announcements in English or bilingual employees to assist non-Spanish speakers. During my journey, which involved a stopover in Mexico City on both the outbound and return flights, I encountered a distressing situation involving my 87-year-old grandmother. Aeromexico staff separated her from the rest of our party, despite the presence of completely vacant seats on one of the flights where we could have easily been accommodated together. When we approached the employees for assistance, they claimed there was nothing they could do, leaving us feeling frustrated and disappointed. Regrettably, the most appalling customer service experience occurred on our return journey, as well as on our way to our destination. All members of our travel group contracted a parasite during our trip. As we were boarding the flight, the airline initially announced that they would wait for a passenger in the bathroom, only to abruptly change their decision and close the doors, leaving us behind. It is common for groups traveling together to prefer not to leave anyone behind, and this unexpected action forced us to endure a gruelling 12-hour wait at the airport. Even after spending approximately $580 per person for the return trip, we encountered further rudeness from the Aeromexico staff during security procedures. Considering the involvement of three countries in our travels, one would expect a certain level of customer service, but unfortunately, Aeromexico failed to meet even the most basic standards. I strongly recommend exploring alternative airlines and investing your money elsewhere for a more satisfactory travel experience.",,,,,
"  Absolute sham of an airline. They offer me an upgrade to Business class - I paid £3100, they took my money and then I ended up in Main Class - I spoke to them and they stated that it was a system error and they would refund me - that was over 7 days ago and still no refund so going to have to make a claim with my Credit card. Awful to deal with - you keep getting fobbed off, I'm convinced they lie to you or make things up just to get you off the phone. I've also noticed that there a Facebook page set up for disgruntled customers who have also been scammed by the Business class upgrade offer. Stay clear of these cowboys.",,,,,
  We had business class tickets in row 2. Just before boarding they downgraded us to middle seats in coach. They lied that they switched aircraft’s and there weren’t enough seats now. Not true. They downgraded us because someone probably paid more money for their tickets so they sent us to the back of the plane in middle seats. We flew 8 hours out of our way to get to Mexico City for this business class flight only for them to take it from us! They are the worst. Do not fly with them ever. ,,,,,
"  It was a 48 hour trip. Our flight got cancelled in one of the connections, FCO-CDG-MEX-PVR, in Paris. We overnight there. Then, the next day, the flight was cancelled again and I was lucky to get on the next available flight. Arrive in Mexico City MEX, late and missed my connection to PVR. One more night at a hotel. The following day I flew to PVR in economy class because business class was full. Arrived in PVR but my luggage did not. It arrived 2 days later. My review is not about the delays but the bad service of Aeromexico crew and ground service. Aeromexico flight attendants are cut and dry sort of unfriendly. They are not rude but they seem that they are not happy doing what they do. During the flight, some of the pursers talk too much. I like to have 1J seat and I constantly hear they chit chatting among themselves. Another annoying factor is that as a typical Mexican Airline, they love sponsors.  Ground personal, are the worst. They seem all so unhappy that I try to do my check in at home and not face them. Watch out, if you have a problem, then you are in trouble. Seldom they find solutions but try to make it more difficult for you.  If you are going to connect in Mexico City Airport, do yourself a favor, choose the fastest connecting flight, I think it is one of the worst airports I have been and don´t rely on Aeromexico Lounge. It is a lounge for anyone that pays a fee to get in. It is uncomfortable, crowed, noise and there is seldom any food to eat. If you are a frequent flyer with AM, you probably already realized that their mileage programe is a hoax. If you want to exchange for a business class ticket they ask in a R/T trip in some cases almost 1 million points. In economy if you are luck with 300,000 points. Do you know how long you will take to accrue that many miles? Aeromexico rips you off and gives bad service. I fly 3 to 4 times a year to Europe alone and I barely have 300,000 miles plus some transferred from my Amex.",,,,,
"  I made the purchase (and paid the difference) for a direct flight Madrid - Monterrey which was modified by Aeromexico with stopover in CDMX. Modified for the second time delaying the scale an hour 17:55 hrs , 3rd 18:00hrs, 4th 20:40hrs, fifth time 23:10hrs, and finally being canceled. During my 8 hrs waiting time, two flights left for Monterrey in my scheduled hour contradicting the reason that the changes were due to weather and we were told BY SPEAKER that we would wait for the staff coming from flight 118 cd juarez, which would land at 20hrs. Making it clear that there was a lack of personnel to take off. The service given by the employees of customer service is very slow, it is deficient and it is incredible that they have so little ability to solve simple questions. Having no refund response, hotel, accommodation, your answer ""check customer service"", we dial during the stay at the airport and tell us ""that is solved at the airport, not with us"", you go to the sales module and tell us ""here we only sell tickets, we do not know anything about hotel or refunds, call by phone"", we approach another employee and his answer is ""send an email"" that is no one can help you solve anything personally (And don't even think that by email they'll solve something) The bags were delivered to us with all the contents inside wet, not damp, soaked, could squeeze clothes. On the return flight from Madrid, there were no water bottles in the seats, as there are regularly. For a 12 hrs flight. Won't fly again with them. Choose Iberia!",,,,,
"  This airline is truly awful, and truly incompetent. They don't care. And they're unscrupulous and disingenuous, aka crooks. I flew to Vallarta from SFO via Mexico City. Outbound was an hour late. They changed my connection flight despite our arriving on time for me to make the original connection. Had a four hour layover as a result. All of that was inconvenient, but within the realm of airline travel in our times. The real issue was the return. I checked in online, had my boarding passes, arrived on time and was ready to board. When I checked in at the desk, they told me I was bumped because of a ""credit card problem."" The roundtrip had been fully paid for and posted two months prior so I knew that was nonsense. I argued, pleaded, used logic and my fluent Spanish. I called for the manager all to no avail. Ten stoic employees observing my rancor, nothing. Long story short, I had to buy a one-way return on another airline (no way was I going to reward bad behavior by rebooking with them). Another day in Vallarta on the weekend and another night of hotel are not the end of the world, but my nerves and usual motto of ""assuming good intentions"" in people took a hit. It's tragic that the flagship carrier of a nation of otherwise good and honest people should be marred by the actions of the few. Luckily, I had paid with credit card that treated me like a customer and refunded me 50% of the fare, but still. Caveat emptor.",,,,,
"  We had a multi city booking through Expedia to travel in Aeromexico. We had to change one of our travellers tickets, when we called them they didn't offer a penalty fee, didn't say because we booked through Expedia we need to call them, they sold us a whole other ticket for $700. We've now been back and forth with their customer service, Expedia and the insurance we purchased and no one can help us? Everyone keeps passing the blame around and no accountability. Not to mention their customer service in general on the phone or at the airport is garbage. Not only have they haven't given us any type of partial refund, but they did sell the seat to someone else which they have denied. Yet, the seat was taken on our flight back. So no refund, they charged my mother a full ticket and sold her seats.",,,,,
"  AeroMexico is one of the worst airlines I've ever had to deal with. They have a horrible customer service experience. We called them regarding our flights being canceled and they refused to give us other options. They also refused to give us a refund. When they refused to give us a refund, we asked for a future credit, which they also denied. I will never book any flights through AeroMexico as they don't try to work with you in any shape or form for any cancellations or reschedules, even when things were on their end to fix. For us, our flight got cancelled due to volcanic activity in Mexico City, which I understood it was out of everyone's control. But the fact that they were unwilling to give us a credit / refund / alternative flight it's just outrageous. They essentially just kept the money. Please do yourself a favor and never book through them. Not worth the fight.",,,,,
"  A thousand words are not enough for me to describe how horrible it was for me and other hundreds of people the experience we had with Aeromexico during the weekend of May 20 and 21st - 2023. Apart from the fact that Aeromexico lost my luggage (then LATAM recovered it), I had to wait in line for literally 6 hours so I could ask ""where's my bag?"". Other people waited for much longer than 6 hours, I was a lucky one. The, when I finally got my turn in line the woman tells me it's not their fault and that I have to look for my luggage again elsewhere or talk to LATAM (which was responsible for my next flight). That weekend while other companies were also having trouble because of some unfortunate climate events, Aeromexico was the only company which made people wait for more than 30 hours so they could take off.  Their website is trash. Their app is trash. And based on other's reviews it seems they don't invest enough in tech so they can offer a better and more automated service. Not to mention the fact that they offer flights in international airports and when you ask their staff if they speak english they just shake their head and turn their backs for you. I hope I never get near Aeromexico again.",,,,,
"  Worst Airline in the World! Flight was delayed from Mexico City to Guadalajara by several hours and then once we finally got to Guadalajara, the second leg of the flight to Tijuana was eventually cancelled. We were left stranded in Guadalajara for the night without any meal vouchers or hotel accommodation. I had to pay for a hotel and taxi out of pocket. So many people in the airport were left stranded and Aeromexico staff were not helpful at all. They were giving so many mis-information. I called to submit a claim for reimbursement for the hotel and taxi and they keep giving me the run-around and just keep telling me it's not their responsibility. I have had similar delay experiences with British Airways and American Airlines in the past, but these airlines have at least reimbursed me for costs incurred because of the delay OR at the very least provided free accommodations.",,,,,
"  Aeromexico is the worst for customer service. They changed our flight to include an overnight stay in Mexico City without offering any help in getting accommodation. When I made inquiries, they made all types of excuses and would not take responsibility for their actions, let alone offer any help whatsoever. Also, they refused to transfer our luggage in Mexico City, so we had to carry it with us to and from the hotel. The staff at their call centre where condescending, rude and abrupt. The same with the staff at the airport. As well, our luggage was damaged and we were lucky that the contents were not damaged/destroyed. ",,,,,
"  Aeromexico has the worst ground staff in Mexico. Bring your ear plugs, for, there are so many announcements, so irritating, but, the worse is when you are watching a movie, they stop it and slaps you an ad from one of their sponsors. The flight attendants are in most part 90% apathetic. Food average. I choose always 1J, sometimes i regret , the flight attendants talk all night when they are not working. If you are a frequent flyer and want to use your miles, good luck, for a business class R/T you would probably need aver 800,000 points. Ground servers in Mexico are not pleasant at all. It seems that they either don´t get paid well enough or just don´t like their jobs. Avoid any problems.",,,,,
  This is the worst airline I have ever experienced. We spent an extra 60$ to get better seats at check in and we ended up missing our connecting flight and they gave us awful  seats even though we paid to get good seats! The staff was super rude. Not to mention we missed our flight because they didnt get us there in time. Our returning flight was delayed for nine hours. There were other returning flights that were earlier but they didn’t put us on any of them. We bought these tickets five months ago. Will never fly this airline again.,,,,,
"  This airline doesn’t even deserve 1 star if you ask me. Myself, along with a group of friends had booked a round trip from Vancouver to Peurto Escondido with a connection in Mexico City. After booking our trip, our flights had been changed at least 4 times leaving us with a 6 hour layover in Mexico City which none of us were happy with, as we had planned on arriving in Puerto earlier that day. Because of this change we all decided to book a flight that would get us to our destination sooner, therefore missing our connecting flight. We assumed everything was fine as all of us continued to receive emails regarding our trip home with Aeromexico, we were even able to check in for our flights online. Little did we know, because we had decided to miss that connection in Mexico City, Aeromexico decided to cancel all of our return trips with no notice. We found this out because a friend of ours had left a day early and gave us a heads up so we called the airline. They were able to reactivate some of our tickets but 3 of our friends were forced to pay another $1200 to buy seats on the same flight back that they initially had. They also do not put the correct gate on the boarding pass or light board which makes for a very stressful airport experience.",,,,,
"  We had a problem with our original flights with another airline to Mexico and couldn't miss our hotel reservation. Brian at Aeromexico not only went above and beyond to put us on new flights, he made sure our baggage fee was waived and if that wasn't enough, hand delivered our connecting flight boarding passes when we already boarded the first plane. Although the flight was expensive, you seldom see good service like that!",,,,,
"  In all it was a good flight. The seats we were saying sitting at the emergency exit the seats were quite bad.  I’m a bit overweight person have a big tummy and I could not get into the into one of the washrooms only one washroom I could get in on the right side. Why do they make these washrooms so small the doors that’s very sad. Overall, we had a great flight, and went to next flight to Aguascalientes.",,,,,
"  We had a terrible experience checking in with Aeromexico in Mexico City. We bought our return flights with WestJet with whom we have free baggage. The staff at Aeromexico stated that they were unable to verify the free baggage claiming that they don’t have a partnership with WestJet. The staff were extremely rude and unhelpful, lacking customer service skills.",,,,,
"  Aeromexico changed my flight twice before our scheduled departure date and our outgoing flight turned out to be an overnight layover. They offered no hotel accommodations and wanted to send my luggage to the final destination. After 2.5 hours of waiting at our 1st arrival, we recovered our luggage so we can wash up before our next flight. Again, no accommodations were given or food vouchers. Our flight going home, same thing - 7 hour layover and no food vouchers to eat while waiting at the airport. We were forced to buy the overpriced food at the airport both times. We lost 2 days of vacation because Aeromexico changed our flight! Also, the WiFi did not work on the flight home and the plane was much smaller, making it a very long and uncomfortable ride after waiting 7 hours at the airport. Do not fly with Aeromexico. They do not care about their passengers. They want to squeeze as many people into 1 plane as possible, even if it means changing your schedule.",,,,,
"  Worst Mexican airline I have ever traveled. I bought my tickets 8 months before and they overbook the flight and we couldn’t board that airplane after waiting 4 hours or more in the airport with two little girls that were tired and starving. Plus the time dealing with them to give us another option to flight to Los Ángeles, at least they pay the hotel and meals for us for one night. The next day the flight with a delay of 2 hours. Horrible service, we will never travel through Aeromexico never again.",,,,,
" First and foremost, why do I pay for seats and not receive them, it's a waste of my monies to pay for a service and not receive what I've paid for. I've been on this airline 4 times in 2 years and it still the same bad service and not getting what I paid for. The aero app is useless, never works and never has my downloaded pass, I go from second class row 5 to the back of the plane - stealing money they are. Parent Delta is just as bad, same as above, then they act as if it's all new to them and never heard of issues. Also unless you apply for credit card you get no skylines, I've been four times and haven't received.",,,,,
  Got bumped because flight was overbooked. Travelling with 5 children I asked them to offer compensation to others as we wanted to fly. Very unhelpful staff. Second time this happens. We now have a 8 hour wait and will arrive at destination after midnight. Wait time at priority line was more than one hour. Never again will i fly them with my kids. Not worth the stress not knowing if you get on despite their setvice inflight is ok.,,,,,
"  I’ve flown with Aeromexico before and had a great experience which is why I felt confident in inviting first time flyers. I cannot stress how disorganized, unprofessional and non accommodating our experience was. We planned a month in advance, bought out tickets, rented a car and airbnb and all fell through because this airline decided to give our seats to other people and we were only 5 amongst 20 other people experiencing this problem. The employees there to assist ended up crying and screaming on how overworked they were while we had to wait for a 7 hour delay. Everyone had a stressful day and it’s understandable that things may go wrong but the level of disregard to the guest was shocking. Never again will we fly Aeromexico ever again.",,,,,
"  Terrible service from Aeromexico and from the person in charge at the Benito Juárez airport, Terminal 2. The airline sells a ticket from Colombia to London with a connection in Mexico, they force the passenger to buy a new ticket because when going through immigration the passenger arrives a hour before the flight and they don't allow you to board because you can't check your luggage. It is an abuse, how can they sell a ticket with a connection in which there will not be time to board the flight. Neither the lady in charge at the airport nor any aeromexico employee offered any alternative. 
 Pésimo servicio de aeromexico y de la persona que se encuentra encargada en aeropuerto Benito Juárez, terminal 2. La aerolínea vende un billete desde Colombia a Londres con conexión en mexico, obligan al pasajero a comprar nuevo boleto porque al pasar por inmigración el pasajero llega una hora antes de vuelo y no le permiten abordar porque no puede documentar su equipaje. Es un abuso, como pueden vender un boleto con una conexión en la que no habrá tiempo de abordar el vuelo. La señora encargada en el aeropuerto ni ningún empleado de aeromexico ofreció ninguna alternativa.",,,,,
"  Just such a terrible and dysfunctional airline starting with customer service. The app is terrible, service has no interest in being of service, business class is nothing of the sort. Stay away.",,,,,
"  
I will never fly on this Airline again. From the terminal at AAA, and the entire flight reeked of Incompetence. Terminal 3 is a joke, similar to small airlines like Air Tobago. There were many Mexicans flying to Canada, and having them fill out their immigrations forms, was done one at a time, not in a bunch explaining. 40% of the AC/USB hubs in this disgusting terminal are DOA. Finding a vacant one is like looking for an oasis in the Sahara. Then the flight: I've never had Flight Attendants who were surly, but several of the FA's on Flight 616 were nasty. I have flown on almost every carrier in N. America, but have never been told that the washroom at the front of the plane was for First Class Only. So the rest of the plane, had two use 2 washrooms, with broken fixtures. No toilet paper, no paper towels, no soap. I was served a salmon pastry, when I told them I have a seafood allergy, they snarled at me to be quiet.",,,,,
"  My brother and I traveled for a music festival. One of Our flights were delayed, which caused one of our luggage to be left in the states couldn’t get a hold of customer service so we had to get an Uber back to the the airport which was over an hour away. We had 4 luggage and all four TSA approved locks were broken open and to our luggage is damaged. We had to replace one going to replace. Total cash value was USD$ 760 After 7 months I was only refund $ 203.81. Avoid the hassle and fly with someone else!",,,,,
"  Charged for an incorrect booking/flight. I was in Mexico City airport at the ticketing counter. I asked for the earliest return flight to Phoenix. The man asked for my card and charged my card, then gave me the ticket. I asked why the destination was Houston TX and not Phoenix. I proceeded to ask for a refund or to have my flight changed. He said he could change the flight, after about an hour of waiting he now says that the flight cannot be changed and I cannot have a refund. I went over to volaris and bought a return ticket without issue. I cant believe these people can get away with scamming their customers. I contacted customer service but after months of the run around this is the message I'm finally sent ""I am sorry to inform you, I wasn't able to complete your request due to the fare purchased is not refundable and any clarification of purchase made directly at the airport has to be completed there. I apologize for the inconvenient, It was an honor to assist you. Cordially, Customer Care Representative"" Never do business with this scam company.",,,,,
" I’ve had two flights with Aeromexico and both times: Despite being told I would receive wheelchair assistance: none was provided. Nor was any accessibility assistance provided unless I went over their head and contacted the airport or the other airline I was flying with. On this last flight, my hip partially dislocated due to all the strain of managing things myself — something that I was trying to avoid. I’ve encountered issues before as someone who only needs mobility assistance in certain circumstances, but I have never encountered this level of ableism or neglect while flying. Flights were delayed by more than an hour. On the return flight this resulted in me and my companion missing two connections and having to travel an extended route to return home. Despite requests when booking, checking in, and at the counter, they were “unable” to seat me next to my travel companion even when we had more expensive seats and were willing to downgrade. Customer service hung up on me twice and chats failed for hours until I was finally directed to someone who instantly disconnected when I informed them of the gravity of the situation. They have refused to talk to me on both Facebook messenger or WhatsApp (they use both services for chat messaging) and their phone lines either don’t answer or I get hung up on. If you have any kind of disability or impairment, please avoid this airline at all costs.",,,,,
"  Attitude is terrible, not only on board services, my luggage was damaged and there are few holes on my backpack and the staff at baggage claim asked us to find the on duty supervisor. The female supervisor was annoying when reached to us and ask ""who asked you to find me""? She found some staff to do the baggage claim application but returned around 5 minutes later and just irritating us by poor attitude saying ‘actually these are ONLY VERY minor damage compared to others damaged luggage, it is not totally tear apart you cannot use it.’ What kind of service is this?",,,,,
  Premier class or whatever they call it is a complete waste. They give you the same uncomfortable seats and only put a bulky divider in the middle seat that they won’t allow you to remove. Especially if traveling as a couple it’s better just to have economy and sit next to each other.,,,,,
"  My family planned a trip to Oaxaca end of October, flight was delayed 4 hours caused by the mechanics of the plane. The delay caused us to miss our connecting flight in Mexico City. They then had no flights for more than a week that they could get us on. They'd take us to Mexico City and no guarantee they'd be able to get us to our destination! They wouldn't give us a refund at the airport, told us we needed to call the customer service! So I have, 3 times! Each time they tell me they can't help and for me to email. That I can only get a refund if I email. I've emailed 3 times since October and never get a return email. Don't fly Aeromexico. They don't value customer service or their commitment to get you where you paid them to take you! Just disgusting service!",,,,,
"  Such a bogus airline. I paid an extra $100 for an economy plus upgrade for extra foot space. The unfortunate result is that our IFE screen were not functioning. I asked the flight attendants to fix it and they claimed to restart but didn’t. I had to ask 3 times and they started to ignore me. Unbelievable lack of customer service. The customer service email address is a joke too. I notified them of my experience and they offered to provide a voucher for the equivalent amount for the upgrade, but didn’t provide one after asking 2 times. This is such a joke airline and I cannot recommend this at all. Lack of professionalism and accountability is unacceptable.",,,,,
"  Terrible experience with Aeromexico in Mexico City, flight number AM 378, on December 28, 2022. First of all they don’t even board by zones, and second thing I was on zone 3 along side with my wife I paid for the seats I was in. I wasn’t even ask to gate check my bag and one of the staff member just pulled me aside and took my bag without asking what zone I was in and than proceed to throw the tag at me, really bad experience with Aeroméxico will not recommend.",,,,,
"  In spite on all the negative reviews I have to be quite different. All worked well, in time and with professional attitude. Some might dispute food, seat comfort etc. But for the 3h+hrs flight I think that all was as expected.",,,,,
"  Very bad communication from Aeromexico customer service. Our flight was delayed from Vancouver to Cancun resulting in losing one day of our vacation time. On contacting Aeromexico customer service regarding the matter, I got a reply after exactly 1 month that they cannot do anything about it. Customer rep name is Alfonso Urbina Valdez. Extremely rude and inconsiderate agent. Not only this, our 4 year old was assigned a separate seat from his guardians. Upon requesting airport staff first they said they cannot do anything about it. Are these people insane or what? I would give negative reviews if I could. Never flying with Aeromexico again.",,,,,
" The worst customer service I experienced with an airline!!! I experienced a very bad costumer service on the same day of my flight. I first decided to upgrade my cabin from economy to business. While talking to the sales executive on the phone and when realized that I will not be refunded for the seats I already selected and paid for in AM Plus I decided not to upgrade. After the call I received an email (confirmation) from Aeromexico and then I realized my initial seat selection which I paid for them 1 month in advance where canceled! Checking on the app, I had to repay to select the seats while those seats I chose initially were not available and even worse no 3 seats next to each other to accommodate my family! Flying with a 2-year-old I had no other choice to upgrade! Apart from the very bad experience I had onboard in the business class (from the quality of the food to behavior of the crew) now the airline is refusing to pay the seats which were canceled by their sales executive! Its an absolute scam and zero customer service as they blocked my number calling them! No proper answer from the customer service (via email) as well. I do not recommend the airline at all!",,,,,
"  AeroMexico is a complete scam. Do not use this airline for anything. Through Expedia, Aeromexico claimed to have purchased our tickets on Delta. They are supposedly partners. AeroMexico sent us a confirmation of our seats and our flight. When we got to the airport, Delta claimed that we didn’t have any seats, and the flight was full. We now could not get to our connecting flight in Los Angeles. We called Aeroméxico at the airport, and they said the flight was full, and there was nothing they could do. Aeromexico also claimed to have bought us tickets and reserve us seats from our flight from Los Angeles to Cancun. According to Delta, this also never happened… even though we showed them an obviously fake confirmation from Aeromexico with our fake reserved seats. This company is a complete scam, and it will cost you thousands of dollars to try and not have your vacation completely ruined after planning for it for literally years. Please save yourself",,,,,
"  Extremely bad customer service and communication. My flight was scheduled to take off at 8:55pm and at 9:10pm they announced that the flight was delayed for an hour because they were waiting for the flight crew. An hour later they said that they were still waiting for 2 crew members, they boarded another flight before our flight and no information about our flight, going on 2 hours Daley waiting for the other flight to board and not even the decency to informed us or give us an update. If any passenger is not at the airport at least 2 hours before the flight they will lose their flight and have to purchase a whole new ticket so I think that is only fair that the airline should have to reimburse all the passengers for the flight.",,,,,
  Avoid this airline. I had 4 separate flights with Aeromexico. Each flight was delayed for hours without an explanation or something for the inconvenience. I will never fly this airline again. Horrible.,,,,,
" I used to be the biggest fan of Aeromexico. The staff was amazing - professional, courteous, and very friendly (and still are with the obvious exceptions (mentioned below). Unfortunately, our recent trip leaves us questioning whether or not we will ever risk using their services again. If you have or have traveled with someone with, a disability, you know how important it is that boarding the aircraft be done in an organized manner. Those that have issues (health, age, children, etc) need that little extra time before regular boarding commences. It's not meant to be a free-for-all. Well, not unless you board your Aeromexico (AM) flight out of the satellite Mexico City airport, NLU (Santa Lucia). NLU is a relatively brand new airport (opened March 2022) and it appears that the AM staff has yet to be trained on basic procedures. We had 2 bad experiences in NLU. The first was flying in on the way to Veracruz and the second was the return trip out. While the first flight was total chaos, we were fortunate enough that several of the gentlemen at the front of the line saw that my husband was an amputee, etc, and immediately waved us to the front. While this was disorganized, it wasn't the mess that the return flight out of NLU was. The second flight, NLU to Guadalajara was a nightmare. There was absolutely no control over the passengers. When it was time to board, there were no zones or even basic pre-boarding. AM had a group of 20-30 who appeared to be traveling together (not young, disabled, etc) who were let on first. We were about halfway in the line. There was no Premier boarding -- one of the benefits that AM promises its passengers who pay a bit more. Nope, it was a cluster eff free-for-all. Oh, silly my. I forgot to mention not only does my 76-year-old amputee husband need the special boarding, but WE WERE also PAYING PREMIER PRICES for the early boarding. We didn't get it. So, we finally get to our seats and watched as there was no control as the passengers boarded. Several economy passengers just casually jammed their stuff in the Premier overhead bins. Result? Hubby had problems with his carry-on (which had his meds) and which came off badly scuffed. Please understand, I realize that space is limited on flights, but if you pay for certain benefits, you should get those benefits. We did not. I wrote to complain and got the stand ""too bad, so sad"" letter in return. I had asked for compensation. Of course, that's not going to happen. No, I wasn't looking for a free flight or reimbursement of our tickets. As my girl Judge Judy says, ""we ate the steak."" What I was looking for was a small compensation to acknowledge that they did not deliver as promised. Instead, I got a form letter that any trained lizard could, and did, write. We will look elsewhere in the future and heartily recommend that you do the same.",,,,,
 I do not recommend flying with Aeromexico at all. I had a few hour layover in Mexico City which they ended up turning into a 26 hour layover (meaning my vacation literally lost a day) with no compensation for food or accommodation. I also had premium seats on one of my flights which we paid a few extra hundred dollars for and they oversold the flight and put us in economy with no food that we ordered and no refund. Also the most turbulence and worst landing I’ve ever experienced - they braked so hard when landing that everyone got shoved forward in their seats. Don’t fly with this airline.,,,,,
"  My main complaint with Aeromexico is they don't stick to their scheduled flying times and flight delays are the customer's problem, not theirs. Due to a flight delay I had an unplanned layover of 16 hours at the Mexico City Airport. The airline doesn't offer any compensation. It doesn't have any customer service. The price I paid for a hotel stay completely negated the savings of buying a cheap plane ticket. I think they should tell people that sleeping on an airport bench is part of the travel package and your airline itinerary is just a rough guide. I wouldn't recommend flying with Aeromexico.",,,,,
"  Traveled in business on three Aeromexico flights on this trip AMS-MEX-GRU-MEX. Overall a fair to poor experience. The biggest positive is the seat is quite comfortable, and that's important. The negatives include an absolute horror show at Mexico City Airport T2 (and an even worse transit to T1). Nothing is particularly easy or smooth and Aeromexico does little to nothing to help ease transiting passengers through the madness. The lounges are third rate and overcrowded. As a result ended up finding a few cafes in the terminal which were far superior than the lounges. The really surprising negative were the Aeromexico business class cabin crews. While efficient in serving meals and performing basic tasks, not one crew had warm, friendly people that either welcomed you or smiled. They come across as some combination of angry and arrogant. It's surprising to me because it's not reflective of Mexico itself, which has some of the warmest, kindest people on earth. Not sure where they find these crews or how they train them but they don't do a particularly good job.",,,,,
"  We had a flight leaving Puerto Vallarta connecting in Mexico City to Toronto. Our fright from PV departed late and then when we landed in Mex City our plane was unable to gate for about 15 mins. When we finally got out of the plane at 17:43 we raced to our connecting flight which is supposed to depart 18:05. We got there at 17:55 and were denied boarding. They sent us to customer service that got us on the next flight at 23:55. We paid for upgraded seats because I’m a tall guy and we did not get them on the later flight due to availability. When we called the airline customer service for a refund for the upgrades they told us to contact the customer service email and promptly hung up on us. We called back and spoke with another representative and she informed us we would indeed have to email customer service. We did email them, but got a prompt email back basically telling us there is nothing they can do refund us. Now that I’ve read reviews for this airline I see it’s a common problem. I will be doing a charge back on my Mastercard when the payment is processed.",,,,,
"  I suggest you fly with another airline if you speak English! They are not fluent in English. The customer service is poor. They cancelled our flight because we could not accept the changes they made, which was a 24 hour layover. They would not refund our money, and tried to charge us $1,200 more dollars for another flight. I hear that they continuously have layover issues. Several people were late to our resort for a wedding due to this airline. They will not accommodate you in any way if you have car trouble and miss your flight. They will not give you a standby flight! They expect you to pay for another flight. Please be wary of this airline! It would be better to spend a little more money, and get better customer service, and know that you would be accommodated fairly if there were issues, which are sometimes inevitable.",,,,,
"  I did not make this trip because Aeromexico does not have bad customer services, they have no customer service. I booked Austin to Lima roundtrip in first class for my husband and I. Approximately 3 months before our trip, I began receiving e-mails with changes to my itinerary ... significant changes which ultimately resulted in 2 extra legs to the trip and removal from first class for all travel except Mexico City to Lima. I have an extensive record of my efforts to speak to someone to address these unacceptable changes - e-mails, calls, Facebook chats - for 2 months and never spoke to anyone who could do anything except give me a different e-mail address to submit my problem to. Thus the extensive record using multiple e-mail addresses provided to me by Aeromexico staff. This itinerary was impossible for my elderly husband - changing planes 4 times, taking an entire day of travel, and riding in coach (after paying for first class) was beyond his capabilities. Ultimately, we had to relinquish our trip - continued to seek some kind of compensation, and have yet to speak to a single person who had any authority to assist us before or since the date of our travels. I will never use this airline for any trip ever again.",,,,,
"  
This review is about the ticket purchase. On September 30, 2022, I purchased a ticket from Aeromexico, in my partners name to fly from Tijuana to Puerto Vallarta. The ticket price was $169.04. I paid with my Capital One credit card, but the transaction was held because my bank questioned the charge. I responded to the bank immediately and the charge went through. All this within 10 minutes or so.. I then received an e-mail confirming that the flight was booked and he was ready to fly. Great, no problem. In the meantime Alejandro got the notice that it was time to check in. When he attempted to check in on line he was unable to do so, and instead was notified that he had to see a gate agent. On Monday October 24, Alejandro got to the airport and went to the ticket counter where he was told that the ticket had not been paid, and he’d have to pay about $436.00 for a new ticket. Not having any other recourse, and needing to get home, he reluctantly paid the exhorbitant amount that Aeromexico required. The next day, he called Aeromexico and told then that the money had been originally paid for the ticket and that he wanted a refund of the more than $400.00 that he was forced into paying. Their response was to offer to refund the $169.04 that was the original cost of the ticket. Note that offering that, indicates that they know they were paid originally and they knew how much. It’s hard to think that this is not a scam, but it is highly unusual that an airline would release the ticket and then turn around and claim it was never paid. ",,,,,
"  Bought a trip back in 2019 for easter 2020, and then COVID hit the world. Instead of giving me my money back on a flight which didn't even take off, they wanted to give me airline credit. On top of that my final destination flight were cancelled permanently, I had no way of getting to the destination I bought the ticket for. They however claimed I could use this for other destinations, which is not what I bought. I sued them and finally received my moneyback after 2 years, obviously with a steep commission paid to the lawyers. Aeromexico has no regulation or care for their customer. I am never going to fly with them again. Don't be swayed by their cheap prices, it’s all a cover up for poor customer service. ",,,,,
" As a frequent flier with Star Alliance, Oneworld over the last 10 years, I STRONGLY recommend anyone to avoid Aeromexico at all costs. Terrible policies (12-month refund period for a flight that they delay for nearly a day) and even worse customer service. I can confidently say they are MUCH worse than budget/low-cost airlines.",,,,,
 This airline refuse to refund my ticket that I purchased through Priceline the traveling day was Nov 19 because I had a family event in Nicaragua. Aeromexico canceled the flight and changed to Nov 18 with a layover in Mexico for 10 hours I call the same day I got an email from Priceline saying the change of traveling plans. Their response was contact Priceline because the ticket were booked through them but Aeromexico charged my credit card Priceline said they can’t refund ticket because they only can make changes back and forth.,,,,,
"  The luggage policy sucks, I had 3 more kgs in my luggage and the airline charged the equivalent of 3 pieces of baggage. I had never been charged like that before, not even on transatlantic flights. I will avoid this airline when travelling for work definitely. The service on board was poor, and the flight attendants were not kind. Poor service and you don't get value for money.",,,,,
"  Club Premier seating it dated. Food in business class was limited to a sandwich, nuts. Thankfully, drinks are included that’s with any other reasonable airline. Airline seems to be giving up — it’s sad.",,,,,
"  Masks required and policed.  Will not be back on this airline. Also, they wanted me to upgrade so I could have a suitcase. That’s when I found out I was only allowed a purse, no carry on suitcase. A $190 upgrade would allow me a suitcase. No way. Never again.",,,,,
"  Very bad experience and lack of professional ethics with customer service personnel, they do not give correct information when buying their tickets. They say everything is included and in the long run an ok ends up paying for luggage. Bad coordination. They should put more professional and trained staff and take the trouble to serve the customer and not be on the phone talking more with other people and then attend to a 45-minute wait for a check-in is ridiculous and this happened to me in Mexico. Very bad if there were less than 0 is my evaluation I do not recommend it at all.  Muy mala experiencia y falta de ética profesional con personal de servicio al cliente, no dan una información correcta al momento comprar sus tickets. Dicen todo está incluido y a la larga un ok termina pagando equipaje. Mala coordinación. Deberían poner personal mas profesional y capacitado y se tomen la molestia de atender al cliente y no estar en el teléfono hablando más con otras personas y luego atenderlo a uno 45 minutos esperar por un check in es ridiculo y más esto me paso en México.  Muy malo si hubiera menos 0 es mi evaluación no la recomiendo para nada .",,,,,
  Aeromexico is stealing from customers by not refunding fully refundable tickets! It’s been 5 weeks since I cancelled my flight and I still do not have my $1600 back. I have asked 3 times to speak with a supervisor and the agent refuses. I also asked to talk to someone in the refund department and they told me that department doesn’t have a phone number! I have no confidence that I will ever get my money back.,,,,,
"  Aeromexico didn't tell me about the visa when I checked in, then I lost the flight because Oficina sent me back and forth. I had to pay an exaggerated new ticket of 2500 euros. A return flight from Mexico to Germany. My luggage is gone too, I'll probably never see it again. Partly very rude how you are treated, no advice and no help. Somehow even foreigners Hostile. I speak spanish but not perfect. I will never fly with Aeromexico again because they ripped it off badly. A short phone call was enough in their own ranks to help me,  Aeromexico hat mich beim Einchecken nicht auf dass Visa hingewiesen,dann habe ich den Flug verloren ,weil dass Oficina mich hin und her geschickt hat. Ein übertriebenes neues Ticket von 2500 Euro musste ich bezahlen. Ein Rückflug von Mexiko nach Deutschland. Mein Gepäck ist auch verschwunden,werde es wohl nie wieder sehen. Zum Teil sehr unverschämt wie man behandelt wird,keine Beratung und keine Hilfe. Irgendwie sogar Ausländer Feindlich. Ich rede Spanisch,aber nicht perfekt. Ich werde nie mehr mit Aeromexico fliegen,denn sie haben kräftig übers Ohr gehauen. Ein kurzes Telefonat hatte ausgereicht in ihren eigenen Reihen um mir zu helfen",,,,,
"  Highly recommend putting a lock/zip tie on your luggage. I packed my girlfriends brand new shoes in my luggage before we left and our bags weren’t there when we arrived at our resort. The people told us we’d get the luggage in two hours, we got them the next day. Also opened my luggage to missing shoes.",,,,,
"  I flew with Aeromexico both ways going to Peru, and both legs of the flight I lost my baggage. The first one I was able to receive after 2 days, but the coming back flight it's already been a week and haven't received it yet. They've located it but keeps pending and not sending it to me.",,,,,
"   It's important to know that if you book a ticket in economy you can't change your flight date if you need to. With over a month's notice, they would not let me change my flight date. I had to lose the entire ticket - full payment. First thing is they should warn you about this at booking.  I understand paying a penalty, but having to pay the entire ticket is unbelievable to me. I'll never fly with them ever and I'll advise others to avoid them also.",,,,,
"  On February 28th, 2022 I purchased three airline tickets from a third party to fly on Aeromexico. One for me, one for my husband and one for my daughter. On April 10, Aero Mexico changed our flights. The change of the flight did not work for my daughter. So I had to cancel her flight and re book by calling Aeromexico. Which they charge me extra for her new flight. They did not let me daughter on the plane with this ticket. They said it was fraud since I was not at the airport with her to show my ID since I purchased it with my credit card. They told her the flight is full and she can not buy a ticket. Twos hours back and forth with them they told her they have a seat for her which she has to pay for. So they cancel her first flight without telling us and the same thing happen for her flight coming back. I will never fly with them again!! If anyone ask me about AeroMexico Ill will definitely tell them not to fly with them! I'm still waiting for my money back!",,,,,
  Terrible service. Mean and unkind employees. Left me waiting 46 minutes to find a wheelchair. Doesn’t have enough staff to operate wheelchair or check everyone in. Horrible food.,,,,,
"  Lines of an hour and a half to be able to check the luggage, more than 35 minutes of waiting to be able to get off the plane and take my connection to my country, delayed flights and consequently loss of connections with themselves. Staff unable to provide support and solutions. They play with people's time because of their lack of competence. The supervisors will try not to compensate you and after receiving 20 people with the same case they redirect you to schedule your new flight. They send you to the furthest hotel (50 min) and are inflexible in giving you an alternative. An incredible lack of empathy, attention and service! It is the worst airline.  Filas de una hora y media para poder chequear el equipaje, más de 35 minutos de espera para poder bajar del avión y tomar mi conexión hacia mi país, retrasó de vuelos y en consecuencia pérdida de las conexiones con ellos mismos. Personal incapacitado para brindar soporte y soluciones. Juegan con el tiempo de las personas por su falta de competencia. Los supervisores intentarán no compensarte y luego de recibir a 20 personas con el mismo caso te redireccionan para programar tu nuevo vuelo. Te envían al hotel más lejano (50 min) y son inflexibles en darte una alternativa. Una falta de empatía increíble, de atención y servicio! Es la peor aerolínea",,,,,
"  Aeromexico just kicked us out of the plane right at the plane door, eventually, we are done boarding check and have a ticket on hand. It’s unbelievable! Our flight from Mexico City to Vancouver on July 3, 2022 , flight number Am694, we are a couple. The flight was supposed to take off at 1:30 am July 3 but they delayed until 6 am. It means we already waited here for 4,5 hours - the whole night for the flight. At the boarding time, they just pulled us back and said that they need to check our passports, so we had to wait at the boarding station for 10 mins for their checking. We didn't know what they were doing, then we were released for heading to the plane. When we were about to get into the plane, right in front of the plane door, one of the staff just stopped us and said that he need to check if there were available seats for us. We did our check-in 14 hours ago and we got a ticket here, we got the seat number here and you did the checking, what do u mean u need to check if there were available seats for us. We waited there for another 10 mins and they just shut the plane door, right in front of us, left us there and the plane took off. We were so shocked by what was happening and couldn't believe what they did. The manager came and said that there was an error in our reservation so they could not let us board the plane. They will transfer us to the next flight without any other explanation. And we had to wait here another 3 hours for the next flight. They gave us business class tickers for the next flight but we didn't need them, we had been in the airport for 11 hours already and we will have to be back to work right after the flight. When we backed to the boarding station, they already issued new tickets and already took our check-in luggage out of the plane. We guessed that they took our seats and gave them to ppl who missed their last flight or whatever. We didn't know the real reason. Aeromexico, they just shut the plane door in front of us, left us there, and took off. Wow! We were so shocked and mad at what was happening. The reason they gave us is a reservation error, the machine couldn't read our ticket Q-code. That was not our false and they checked our passport twice, which means if there was something wrong they should have known abt it. They just did it to us for an unacceptable reason and didn’t care about if we accept it or not. Such a terrible experience! This is my first time with AeroMexico and also will be the last time. You never know the feeling until they do it to you! Hopefully, my sharing can let u consider not booking this airline - a terrible service!",,,,,
"  I would avoid it at all costs. They are very disorganized, all 4 of our flights were randomly delayed, and we ended up losing a business class seat that we paid for and they never refunded us. No one from customer support is responsive, they lie and ignore your emails and questions. ",,,,,
"  On May 16, 2022, I purchased 4 airline tickets from Aeromexico for myself and my family. In less than 24 hours, we had to cancel those flights. When we called to cancel, we were assured that a full refund would be issued in 7-10 business days. After that time frame, we called again. We were given confirmation numbers of the cancellation, the refund amount and again assured that a refund would be issued within 2 weeks. We called again after the two weeks and were told that the refund was already issued and my bank must be holding it. I work at the bank and knew this to be false information but I called the bank anyway for due diligence. The bank assured me that no refund was being held and there were no pending deposits. So, I called again! This time we were told that the refund was issued and would hit our bank within 3-4 weeks. Now, we are at 36 days and counting. This is incredibly unprofessional and frustrating. We receive a different response every time we call. The only consistency is that we are told the refund is issued. The total amount is $1458.07. They've given us this number several times. That is a lot of money to be held interest free for over a month.",,,,,
  I will never fly with Aeromexico again. Hardly speaks English. Customer service is very bad. I was not able to get my luggage even after 72 hours. No tracing no help tracing them and no compensation. Their reps are rude.,,,,,
" Not worth it. An overpriced piece of garbage of an airline. The airline sells itself as being above the other way more economical airlines. The reality is that you’ll be delayed on every step of your journey, the staff will be rude and overall they don’t care about getting you on time anywhere. My flight was delayed in Amsterdam and then canceled in Mexico City. I have to wait 5 hours for my next flight. Ah and also my screen on my seat was broken. I truly regret paying for a 'nicer' airline. If you can avoid it don’t fly with them.",,,,,
  This is and was the worst airline I've ever flown! Our flight is 4 hours late and counting. They gave us noticed for the flight change when we were checking in to the flight and again when supposed to board at the later time. They promised to give us 600 pesos redemption for any food (except alcohol) at the restaurant. As soon as we got there they said that the coupon was only good for only one type of sandwich and a coke. Check-in bags are super overpriced and we are overall extremely dissatisfied with Aeromexico! Just terrible! We will never fly with them again.,,,,,
"  I purchased a business class ticket for Sunday with a return on Friday from Medellin Colombia to San Antonio, Texas, USA. I had the times confused with 12:30 am being at night and I figured out my mistake, luckily it was the afternoon and the flight was delayed but while I was at the airport I was held up and was late for the first flight. Not only was my first flight missed, but Aeromexico also canceled my second flight for no show. I had to rebook my flight for Personal instead of Business (it was a full flight) and that flight on Friday was over 3 hours late. We were supposed to leave at 6:15 pm but ended up leaving at 9:30 pm. I can understand missing my first flight, I got confused between 12:30 am and 12:30 pm and when I realized my mistake I arrived a little too late. I understand this, but then my second flight was canceled and Aeromexico was 3+ hours late on their flight return flight and also very late on their flight out that I missed and thought was Sunday night, not Saturday afternoon. I accept missing the first flight but I would have liked my 2nd flight to be refunded. It was a full flight so there was no money lost on Aeromexico's end and in fact, I paid more for the second flight. I don't feel it's fair that the airline canceled my second flight even though I flew out of Medellin a few hours later and rebooked the same ticket through you the same day. It feels very unfair I get punished so heavily for being late but when Aeromexico is late on both flights there is no issue on their end. I've been a very good customer, I have only been late to a flight one other time in my life. I am totally okay with losing the first flight but feel it is very unfair to lose my 2nd flight, especially since the return flight was full,  the outgoing and return flight was very late (3+ hours), I booked the same flight twice, the second booking was more expensive than the first, and the second ticket wasn't business class.  Their communication is the absolute worst! I have called numerous times, the chat on their website doesn't work, and I have emailed them 3 times in the past month with zero response. I would really appreciate a refund on my second flight or at least airline credit because again Aeromexico didn't lose any money (in fact it made more since I booked the same flight twice for more expensive) and I arrived home very late last night.",,,,,
"  AM0025 to Amsterdam was supposed to leave at 22:10. What followed over the next three hours as we waited in the aircraft were repeated announcements of imminent departures in 5, max ten minutes, the last time at 23:25. At 00:12, we were informed that our departure would be transferred to a different, shorter, runways which would require us to first reduce some mail tonnage and we should not expect to take off for the next 25 minutes. I think this was the only announcement during the whole flight. At 00:21 at least the stewardesses decided to show themselves offering passengers a glass of water, basically the least they could do. At 1:00, the mail truck arrived to remove the excess mail baggage. Eventually pushback started at 1:15, and flight finally took off at 1:35. After that service was friendly and consistently in Spanish, despite me consistently indicating that I didn't speak Spanish. Luckily I managed to get some sleep, but when I awoke I found that the entertainment system had frozen. I just read my book for the remainder of this awful flight. No more Aeromexico for me ever again.",,,,,
"  I had a business flight to the USA from MX in January. They canceled my flight on Monday and rebooked me for Tuesday. I get there on Tuesday, they cancel my flight again. I believe it was due to low staff and people getting COVID. Fine. I guess I just will not go, it was suppose to be for 3 days total anyway. I asked for a refund at the desk, they said I have to call. I call, they said I have to send an email. Five months later, after multiple tickets being sent in, they finally responded about my refund. They said that they cannot offer a refund because it was due to weather conditions, I'm pretty sure it wasn't, according to what the front desk told me.  Late response. No refund.",,,,,
"  I’d rather walk or swim to my destination than fly with this  company again. Hidden fees, a totally incompetent staff, subpar food and inflight service. One attendant didn’t care that I had my allotted 2 carry on bags, another charged me $93 dollars to check one of them even though the weight and size was okay. It’s no wonder they went bankrupt. Just pay the extra and fly a different airline unless you enjoy getting bent over.",,,,,
"  Flight from LAX was delayed so they rebooked us on a flight 8 hours later. Asked and denied our request to be rebooked on a partner airline in order to make connection. All the agents at Lax were delta air. Literally took hours to rebook as they’re unfamiliar with Aeromexico booking policy. At Mexico city, had to to wait another 13 hours for connection. Made us pick up our checked luggage, then refused drop off because departure flight was more than 6 hours away. Food was also terrible. Economy food might have been better. Got a fairly decent deal for this flight. But will never fly them again no matter how good of a deal again. Not surprised this flagship airline is only the third largest in Mexico.",,,,,
"  Start great, get people in the plane, little late but nothing crazy (10min). Shortly after everyone is in it start to be really hot, 45 min later we got told to unboard the plane due to mechanical, no more announcement, everybody know they gonna miss their connection. But AeroMexico tell everyone that everything is fine We will replane the aircraft shortly (but don’t know went) and everything will be taking care of in Mexico City. 1 hour later, We all know we miss our connection basically. Basically land around 4pm… In Mexico City We got information in the plane, for me that was to present myself at gate 62. Run to the gate, there was no one there. Try to find a place to sort my stuff because again knowing that everyone was late, and waiting in Guadalajara, why not make it there.  Finally after 3 hour in line, finally talk to a person, Get another flight at 1am. No refund on my upgrade I made on the flight I miss ‘cause no more seats. And a beautiful 350 pesos vouchers for Starbucks. Avoid at all cost please, they are just not professional.",,,,,
"  Torreón to San Jose del Cabo via Mexico City. Why pay Aeromexico prices for budget airline treatment? Unbelievably terrible treatment from Aeromexico. We were flying from Torreón to San Jose del Cabo via Mexico City; arrived in Mexico City to find out that they had over overbooked the next flight by more than 16 people. We were kicked off the flight, stranded in Mexico City with the next available flight not until 7am the next day (aka waking up at 3am). Because they had overbooked ALL the flights for today. Then we wait in customer service lines for over an hour just to get rebooked. I get that overbooking happens but more than a dozen of us paying customers who made reservations FAR in advance should not be treated like cattle. Families with children, elderly people, all stranded. This is criminal behavior. We paid for a flight with convenient arrival and departure times, and instead are receiving a cheap early AM flight. And worst of all, not even a single ""we're sorry."" We will be avoiding Aeromexico at all costs; if you're gonna be treated like livestock anyway, might as well go with a cheaper airline.",,,,,
" I had a flight from Cancun to Los Cabo’s with a connection in Mexico City. Mexico City airport is a disaster! We were 30 minutes late leaving Cancun then right before we were to land in Mexico City the plane went in circles for 15 minutes. Upon arrival the cabin crew told us don’t worry we know people have connecting flights and we will take care of you don’t worry! A joke! When I was able to finally get off plane I had two minutes to get to my gate, upon arrival they let some people through that were on my flight but not me. I had a first class ticket and the attendant at desk told me the previous airplane had issued and they had to downsize to a small airplane and 60people don’t have flights. When I saw a lady go through that was on my same flight I asked why is she able to go and he said I’m not sure, they then directed me to the a desk to rebook my ticket which is for a whole next day! No compassion or care they gave me my vouchers and that was it. Question to this airline why do you have connection flights if you know your not going to be able to fulfill the flyers to their connecting flights. I’m waiting for my luggage and I can’t wait to see what type of hotel they set me up in after reading these reviews.",,,,,
"  They delayed our flight and we lost our connecting flight, we had to stay in Mexico City and this is the place Aeromexico sends their “guests”- Wonderful VIP treatment as you can see below. I’ve got only one good thing to say about this hell hole. The staff are lovely and very friendly The hotel resembles more a 2 star prison than a hotel.  Extremely frustrating and disappointing is not enough to describe the whole experience. Traveller beware photos attached for reference. At this point I’m just hoping we won’t wake up with bed bug bites. How on earth is this considered a 4 star hotel is beyond me. What a joke! Will let the pics speak for themselves Enjoy! Showcasing the welcoming elevators. Bathtub/ shower combo pealing away and featuring stains from past guests. Another nice feature the tub didn’t drain the water, therefore with two of us in a room I got to enjoy a tepid dirty shower. Stains on the rugs everywhere and beautiful finishing touches. Sanitation protocols in place as we find hairs in the beds and bathroom sink, delightful touches.  Next morning they delayed the flight again now leaving Mexico City going to Canada because they had no flight crew. Been waiting for hours with 100’s of people in an overly crowded room because there are 3 delayed flights all with no crew and still no hope in sight of getting home. Had to sit on the floor because there is no room for some many people with delayed flights. Once we had boarded the flight, they said the plane was over capacity so they had to take 6 people off, threatening that otherwise the whole flight would be canceled. Finally after much convincing 6 people got off. It took another hour or so to sort out whatever situation that created, as they had to sort and find the luggage and get it off the plane.  Needless to say they have lost our business and will avoid at all costs having to fly with them again",,,,,
  They don't have any type of consideration and respect. I have my cousin that they wont let her board to the gate. Not even do her check in just because she was 2 hrs before the flight. They wanted her to be there 3 hrs before. I can't understand what's the difference between 2 hrs and 3hrs before the departure.  When she was talking to them they simply ignored her.,,,,,
" Delayed flight as always. Aeromexico loves to delay flights, and very bad customer service. Now we have to wait for more than 2 hours because “the crew is on their way”. I will try to never fly with Aeromexico again.",,,,,
  Terrible airline. The staff review documents multiple times and give imprecise instructions to passengers. No call to announce departure and seems like purposely want passengers to miss the flights. Worse experience with an airline.,,,,,
 Pretty much no customer service at the airport or online. They left my luggage in Mexico City. At the airport staff were rude and not willing to help. I've submitted a claim but after 12hrs there's still no response or updates. Because my MX to La Paz flight is not showing up in the system I need to reach a customer service representative to edit my claim but it's impossible to reach anyone. They promised at the airport they would update it but they didn't. Oh and my TV screen didn't work on both flights!,,,,,
"  Some friends and I were flying from Zurich to San José del Cabo. We booked Economy Comfort seats using the Aeromexico homepage. First disappointment: At the airport they said something didn't work, they cannot seat us at the booked economy comfort seats and we got very bad middle seats. At least it was said the charge for the seats gets refunded since it's clearly seen what was booked and where we are seated. Several other people had the same issue (in fact everyone who booked a seat upgrade online - the queue at the service desk was therefore quite long). Second and even worse disappointment: I got in contact with Aeromexico for the refund, a month later I got the answer that there will be no refund and they are sorry for the inconvenience. This is just fraud, they double booked and got paid for the economy comfort seats (in advance online and then again on site) and refuse to refund a performance not rendered. Never again.",,,,,
"  Aeromexico left my bags in Mexico City after checking them in. Arrived at LAX with missing luggage and no help from the lazy workers standing around. Nobody knows the correct information, Nobody wanted to help except Cynthia at the Delta Luggage assistance desk. Although I paid for my luggage, paid to get back into the US once we stopped to connect to another flight in Mexico City. I arrive home in Los Angeles with no luggage and little help. I called customer service and the representative informed me to send an email to [email protected] and wait 15 - 25 days for a response. Also, paid for wifi during the flight which was nonexistent.",,,,,
"  This is my 5th flight I've taken with Aeromexico. (All within the same itinerary). Currently, waiting for my 6th flight and I don't have high hopes. I had to take 3 one way tickets to fulfill a wedding schedule. LAX to MEX to GTO GTO to MEX to Cancun Cancun to MEX to LAX This airline was not on time once. 5 flights ALL delayed. And I'm sure the 6th will be as well. Apparently the only flight to leave on time was my connection back to LA from Mexico City. 2.5hr delay LAX to MXC 1.5hr delay MXC to GTO 3hrs delay GTO to MXC 2hr delay GTO to Cancun (resulted in a missing my first day at the resort) 1hr delay Cancun to MXC (resulted in a missed connection) My first 2 flights were First Class, the 3rd Economy. The staff is friendly enough, but the food is atrocious. In Cancun, once I finally arrived after being delayed leaving GTO and MEX, my suitcase did not come out until near the end of the baggage, even though it should have been priority as I was First Class. I am assuming it's because the priority tag was ripped; but I feel that the Ground Staff should know what their Priority tags looks like. All and all, I will never fly this airline again. This was the most miserable travel experience I have ever experienced.",,,,,
"  Decided to join their loyalty status, I flew with them for over 2 years, then the pandemic came. Since COVID was with us for a couple of years I couldn't fly for obvious reasons. I had the joy of getting married a couple of weeks ago only to realize that my plans to use the miles I accumulated to go on my honeymoon weren't there anymore. Hopefully won't be flying with them anymore.",,,,,
" Aeromexico is a terrible airline - buyer beware! Think twice before you book a flight, and make sure you read the fine print every time. I have traveled to hundreds of cities, and I have never experienced such a terrible level of service. I purchased a ticket, confirmed my flight and I was bumped from the flight at the last minute because they ""didn't have enough seats"". Of course, one would expect a refund having paid for a flight and being denied boarding, but even this was not confirmed at the gate and the airline said I need to reach out by phone. Here's the catch - Aeromexico has no customer support phone line! They only accept emails. This is incredibly frustrating and borderline manipulative. Do not fly AeroMexico!",,,,,
"  My mother was in a bad accident and in ICU fighting for her life. We had a flight coming up and though we didn’t pay the premium airfare, we thought maybe with a medical emergency they would allow us to pay the cost and move our dates. I called customer service and was told no I didn’t get that type of ticket, but maybe send an email to customer service (makes no sense) and they would be able to help me. I send the email and get a confirmation number back saying they’ll be in touch in a couple of days. I waited 2 weeks. I tried to reach them via email and by Facebook messenger and all I would get is an automated response saying someone will be with me shortly. No one ever comes on. Finally, I got tired of waiting and left a bad review on their Facebook page. Surprise! I get a message asking if I needed help. They told me to send a document proving my case, which I did even though the hospital stated that’s a HIPPA violation to state her diagnosis like they asked. I get an email back saying sorry but you will just have to take the loss on your tickets. So on top of my mother in an induced coma for the last 4 weeks, I now lose almost $2000 in airfare. Shame on them for their lack of compassion in extreme situations. I was even offering more money to fill their greedy pockets and they still said now. I will never use them again and will always steer my friends away from them. They should be ashamed.",,,,,
  The worst airline ever. They charged me 50 dollars for local flight and 30 dollars for international one and then they lost me. The worst part was that there was no representative in baggage claim at 2:30 am and waited for 30 minutes to somebody call them. Food is mediocre. Wifi is only free for messaging and they don’t provide blanket. Definitely would not recommend it.,,,,,
"  After being issued EMD vouchers for flights cancelled by Aeromexico in 2020, they refuse to extend the validity of our vouchers for 6 months to allow us to travel directly, safely and affordably. This is despite the fact that for the entire duration of the vouchers validity, AM were not running direct flights from the UK, the costs of all indirect flights now total four times more than the value of our vouchers. This renders the EMD vouchers useless and Aeromexico have essentially stolen £884 from us. Hours and hours on the phone, told conflicting information by phone operative vs email operative. So sad and disappointing, we are UK tourists desperately wanting to experience Mexico but instead have felt completely frustrated and robbed. Do not book with Aeromexico, British Airways have flights for a fraction of the cost and are much more reliable and less corrupt.",,,,,
"  They kept the money from a canceled flight in 2020 and said they won't refund it nor issue a voucher or anything. No matter how many times I contacted them, also it's very very hard to get a hold of someone and they never reply the email requests.",,,,,
" This was the worst airline experience I have ever had. On our flight from Chicago to Mexico City our bags were forcibly checked for being the “last to check in” even though we checked in via their app at 6am Thursday for a 12:30am Friday flight and then checked in again upon arrival at the airport at 7pm. This was the first flight to be delayed, the staff at the gate and flight attendants were beyond rude and unhelpful, and the plane ride itself was horrendous. Our flight home from Cancun to Mexico City was delayed for over an hour and we were not informed of this delay until we were supposed to be boarding, we still do not know why the plane was delayed. We had a connecting flight to make in Mexico City which we made them aware of and they promised 3 times that we would make it, Mexico City would hold the plane for us. We were told we would touch down in Mexico City at 6pm, instead we touched down at 6.37. Our connecting flight left at 6.50. We ran across the airport only to miss our connecting flight and play the game of how are we getting home. It was a struggle to find anyone in the airport in uniform who spoke enough English to understand us. Person after person just told us, we don’t speak English, sorry we can’t help you. We finally get someone to help us book a new flight that was 15 hours later. Aeromexico gave us vouchers for a hotel, transportation, and some food. Very generous, thank you. We get to the hotel they put us in to find out the hotel was booked up completely and we were going to have to wait 30 minutes to then be shuttled another 20 to a new hotel. By this time it was 12.30 in the morning and we had to be up again at 5 just to head back for our new flight. It was such a frustrating travel day. Our new flight starts boarding on time at 9am, we are so excited to be leaving and leaving on time until we sit on the plane fully boarded for 40 minutes before we even take off. Again, the flight was delayed. Out of 4 flights in total that we took on this one trip, 3 flights were delayed for at least 40 minutes. I do not recommend flying with Aeromexico and I especially do not recommend flying with them when you have a connecting flight. Your odds of making it are slim. The staff were unhelpful and rude and if at all possible I would rate my experience with them a 0/10. Never again will I be flying with Aeromexico.",,,,,
"  Never Again. Aeromexico was a very bad experience in so many ways. Food is cookies and coke, chairs are so old, on-board Wifi connections with no Internet, Movies stop working every five minutes, passenger boarding from front to rear instead of rear to front, insufficient overhead storage, no gates in Mex City. Inability to arrive/depart on time, lack of accountability, Lying to customers and blaming air traffic control for company delays to avoid issuing hotel vouchers, cabin crew who disappear during the flights. I arrived 2 hours ahead of departure time and checked in with no problem. I was told that flight was on time and boarding would start 320PM for a 4:10 PM departure. The plane arrived at 3:40 in Merida. Shortly after they announced that, the flight would be delayed until 5pm due to air traffic control delays. A big lie of course. Around 430PM the gate paged me and told me that I should not get on the plane because most likely my connecting flight would depart before we arrived. The gate agent manager said tough luck and refused my accommodation request. I opted to board and take my chances.  When we arrived my flight was still on the ground. But the pilot parked 3 feet short of the spot he needed to be and a tow truck took 15 minutes to move the plane another 3 feet. First class disembarked using the staircase, but then the staircase broke and another 15 minutes were required to get another staircase. Pilots did not inform the passengers about the bad parking job nor the staircase. My name was removed from the passenger manifest to Miami without even informing me or asking consent. The new flight was the next day. With me off the passenger manifest, my original flight to Miami could take off without me. After I made a huge scene in the middle of the hundreds of people waiting at the Mexico city counter, I was awarded a hotel room and 4 hours of sleep. And of course as mentioned by others, another COVID test costing 750 pesos was required. Aeromexico is a total joke.",,,,,
"  I bought a ticket for a flight from Ecuador to Russia with Aeromexico and Air France. The day after the purchase, I received a letter that one of the flights was changed, the new route was not suitable for me, because I do not have a visa to Europe and I was not able to fly on the new changed route. In this connection, an involuntary refund was issued, the money for which the airline does not want to return. Today is March 7th 2022 and support is just ignoring my refund messages. ",,,,,
"  We were scheduled to fly from Merida on 28Feb 2022, flight# AM 829 and connect to Delta flight# DL605 to Minneapolis. AM 829 was 2+ hours late causing us to miss our connection to DL605. We were told we would have to return to the main ticketing counter to find a solution to our problem. Going back out of the security area and waited to talk with an agent. When we finally spoke with an agent, we were told we would have to wait until the next day to get the same flight. Asked if we could take a different flight to anywhere in the USA, then to Minneapolis, was met with a resounding NO! How about a hotel voucher? NO! How about a voucher for a new COVID test because AeroMexico delayed our travel? NO! Several other passengers were in the same situation. One person did talk someone into a hotel voucher, but we were refused. Our decision was to get out of Merida right away and make it to Mexico City, so we did not have to deal with the endless no responses we were encountering from AeroMexico. AeroMexico did get us boarding request with Delta (not boarding passes) but offered us nothing for our extra lodging costs and inconvenience. They said Delta would determine if our COVID test were still valid. We were lucky to find seats on DL605. We had paid for Comfort+ but had to settle for Main 1. If I was Delta, I would cut my alliance with AeroMexico yesterday. Local flyers said this was typical for your punctuality.",,,,,
" My wife and I left Nicaragua on 20 Feb 22, Business class to Vancouver via Mexico. There was no meal served other than a packet of chips on the first leg, on the leg from Mexico to Vancouver there were 16 business class seats and a proper meal for 8 people other than a disgusting 2 minute noodles which went in the bin. Be warned do not fly with these cheap skates, their cabin crew are rude and meals almost non existent. ",,,,,
"  Their customer service is worst. They seem very helpful but each one gives a different solution. I canceled my trip in December 2021 and was issues an open ticket. Since then have been calling them to get a new reservation some agents says they can help some say that there is an issue with the reservation and only customer support (AMCS) can help. Its been 15 days and this AMCS and responded to my email. I lost my hotel booking and had to pay penalty. I called the number again hoping someone can assist. Was on a call for 2.5 hours (1.5 hours was on hold) and she said she can exchange my ticket but will need to call me in an hour. She didn't call but generated a new pending reservation with difference of $3500 while she said the difference will be not more than $200. I called the number again today (the next day), after 1 hour of explaining the entire issue she says only AMCS can help but I need to pay for exchange and she can do it. Finally I agreed for new dates for exchange, she hung up the call. This is so frustrating. My $5400 is stuck with Aeromexico and I have lost around $500 dollars on hotel booking cancelation due to their pathetic customer support. their agents itself have no way of contacting the AMCS which seems like a high authority of customer support who can only take decisions about upgrades or refund. Such a frustrating and disappointing experience. ",,,,,
"  The staff in Mexico City are rude and unprofessional. I went to terminal 2 which is what my ticket said and waited for someone to check us in, finally at 830 they said no you go to terminal 3. I go over there and the lady said sorry your flight is already gone? I said it wasn’t supposed to leave until 915? She said you should of checked in, I told her I’ve been trying nobody will help me and my phone has no service here. She said to me not my problem you have to buy more tickets I asked to speak with a manager she sent Javier to me, he said nothing I can do you gotta buy more tickets or go to a different airline if you don’t like i. Which I ended up doing I went to American airline and thanks to them I got home.",,,,,
" Disappointing on all fronts. They offer online check-in, but there is no bag drop line. Which means despite having checked in in advance, I still had to wait in the same line as people that didn’t even have boarding passes. Furthermore, the check in agent informed me that my electronic boarding pass would not work so he issued me a new, paper boarding pass. The boarding process in YUL was chaotic and disorganized. I had to connect in MEX and luckily I had plenty of time as there was no gate information available, not on the boards in the airport, not on the app, not on the website. The aircraft were underwhelming, uncomfortable, and the service subpar. I won’t be taking Aeromexico again unless absolutely necessary.",,,,,
Shanghai to Tehran return July 2012. Direct flight to Tehran. Economy class. Aircraft A310. Fare was quite good. Check-in fast. Cabin crew showed Iranian hospitality. No individual inflight entertainment but fairly speaking since the flight was at night. One toilet closed for whole trip the other two were not clean and almost out of tissue. Food was enough and fine for me. Many drink options. Flying time was less than 10 hours on my way to Tehran and less than 8 on the way back to Shanghai. Considering all the above I will certainly choose this airline next time for my trip to Tehran.,,,,,
DXB-IKA. A300-600 aircraft clean cabin with friendly flight attendants variety of meals were good but the quality of meal was very poor.,,,,,
Madrid - Santa Cruz B747-400 economy. Checked in at Palma okay on connection but no through booking for seats. Check in at Madrid and Aerosur cabin luggage allowance less than originating airline (through ticket) so cabin bag removed and put in hold. Entering plane strong toilet odour throughout the cabin. Generally a very dirty cabin interior with hard uncomfortable seating. No inflight films available. Bar service once glass of wine and water. Cabin staff said they had run out. Dinner was a greasy stodgy rice. I've got my return to look forward to - and all for £1450.00 return. Awful - I do this trip 3 times a year and nobody else treats passengers like this.,,,,,
Santa Cruz to La Paz. The flight we were booked on was cancelled two days in advance and we were switched to a later flight. This flight was then delayed by over an hour and there was no information given as to how long the delay would be - the aircraft just didn't turn up. Once finally on board no acknowledgement of the delay but otherwise ok - a small sandwich and drink were served which was fine for such a short flight. The aircraft was quite old although not as old as some others we saw - they still use 727s for some flights.,,,,,
Zero: contact their reservation/sales desk by sending 7 emails in Spanish and English. To this day I never received any reply of any kind. Still don't have my reservation code so still unsure if my reservation exist. Have not travelled yet so can not rate on board experience.,,,,,
Buenos Aires to Miami with a delay in the output of Buenos Aires 5hrs. After a scheduled stopover in Santa Cruz in Bolivia suffered a further delay of 4 hours. In addition to this as the plane that took us up was very small for the flight he was forced to make an additional stop to fuel in Cali Colombia. The planes we had to take us to get to Miami were dirty with broken seats no kind of entertainment (such as TV). The poor and inattentive staff of course had to deal with few resources. The return flight similar. Delays old planes but most of the journey by plane Miami-Santa Cruz had a noise in your engine that was intolerable to the ears. Large number of passengers frightened by the strange sound was heard constantly.,,,,,
Santa Cruz to Cochabamba Cochabamba to La Paz. This airline tries hard to fill the gap left by the collapse of Aero Lloyd Boliviano but is still plagued by constant changes to schedules usually because the aircraft flying the international route (Brazil) is late in arriving in Santa Cruz and therefore delays the local flights. It also tends to overbook flights and then moves confirmed ticket holders to later flights (it is really important to reconfirm flights) and will even change flight schedules back in time so flights depart 2 hours earlier then scheduled. The airline is fine if you are not in a hurry and don't mind delayed flights changed schedules and don't mind having confirmed tickets ignored.,,,,,
Santa Cruz Bolivia to Sao Paulo Brazil - a saving of about $50US over GOL. At the airport check-in was easy. I recommend that you arrive early to avoid the impending line. The counter staff was as friendly and they did not charge me for my extra luggage weight. I was impressed by the 737 that AeroSur is using on this international flight [do note that most AeroSur flights use aging 727s]. The flight attendants served a box meal and drinks on this two hours flight and we arrived on time. .,,,,,
La Paz - Sucre in an ex-Mexicana 727. Ticketing process is manual and very slow - beware and get your tickets before the airport! We were handed a little snack bag as we boarded then served drinks on board - a great way to provide good service on a short flight.,,,,,
Santa Cruz Bolivia to Sao Paulo Brazil. At the airport check-in was easy. It pays to arrive early and avoid the impending line. The counter staff was friendly and they did not charge me for my extra weight (about 4 kilos). I was impressed by the new 737 that Aerosur used on this leg - most AeroSur flights use older 727. The flight attendants served a box meal and drinks on a 2 hours flight and we arrived on time. I would use them again for this route.,,,,,
AeroSur has become the leading Bolivian airline after the breakdown of Lloyd Aereo Boliviano (LAB). VVI-CBB-TJA. Checking in took about forever and the Aerosur ground staff forgot to mention airport tax that still had to be paid. This was mentioned by security officers with only 15 minutes to go. We still made it on time despite the lack of help of ground staff. TJA-VVI. While checking in I was offered to take a flight right way or two hours later. I choose the latter but was refused because the luggage guy had already tagged my suitcase for the early flight. Of course they couldn't get it back. Again total lack of service of ground staff. The flights were ok albeit not on time. Flying in these countries is never on time. Despite all this I would certainly choose AeroSur next time but only because there's no reasonable alternative.,,,,,
" Africa World Airlines is unclean, unsafe, unpunctual and unconcerned. My premium economy flight from Kumasi to Accra was delayed by 2 hours after checking in but nobody from the airline told us any reason. All the passengers were crowded into a small area with no social distancing as if there was no pandemic happening. When we finally boarded the flight, the hostess was constantly removing her nose mask to flirt with some politician in the front seat. I asked her for a cup of coffee and was refused because she said only water is allowed due to COVID. For the extra price that we are paying for premium economy and the number of hours that they hold us hostage we deserve better! The seat was dirty and the armrest plastic was chipped, while the signs on the ancient noisy plane were all in Chinese. You could feel the plane shaking the whole time during the flight which makes you wonder if they even do proper maintenance. We finally reached our destination nearly 3 hours late but my baggage did not arrive. There were people from earlier flights also waiting there for their bags so this seems to be a very common thing. The airport staff were rude and told us to wait and maybe our bags would come, maybe not. I wound up missing my flight on Turkish Airlines while waiting for the bag and had to pay for a hotel and to get a new PCR test to travel the next day. I will never fly with this airline again even if it was the last airline in the world and nor will I allow my loved ones to risk their lives. Next time I will just take the VIP bus from Kumasi to ensure I arrive in comfort and punctuality.",,,,,
"  Needs to hold itself accountable for their actions. Arrived at our destination only to realize about 99% of passenger's luggage was not on the flight. Only one passenger had her luggage, how was this even possible? Had to wait for about 2 hours more without any form of compensation. What was even more annoying was the fact that they didn't seem to care much about it as many clients were frustrated with the situation. They need serious competition from another domestic airline in Ghana.",,,,,
  AWA needs to be held accountable for their bad service. They have never been on time ever in all the times that I have flown on their planes. The planes are small and old and dirty and staffs are rude and arrogant. It is normal for your flight to be two or three hours delayed every time. But if you come even one minute late for checking in they will sell your seat to another person and make you buy it again. During the flight they used to give sandwiches and pastries and juices but now only water is given for flights of almost one hour. Also during the Covid times they are not maintaining any social distancing on the plane. ,,,,,
"  Africa World Airlines is the worst airline in the world.  I was supposed to fly from Lagos to Accra on the 3rd of September, but my flight was cancelled without notice. I tried to travel again on the 7th of September but this was also cancelled. They have no office in Lagos so I had to drive all the way to the airport every day, only to find that they were closed. I was finally able to book my flight after paying 20,000 Naira to one of the airport workers who knew someone who worked there. They also require you to pay 50,000 Naira to take an expensive Covid test before they allow you to board their flights. When I reached the airport for travel, they refused to check me in because I was wearing a face shield instead of a mask and they made me pay extra to buy a mask from one of the airport shops. Then when we arrived in Ghana, they charged me another £120 to take another test at the airport there. Why can't they just charge one single price for their services instead of advertising one price and then trying to squeeze more money out of their poor customers? The Covid tests should also be free for their passengers instead of trying to make even more profit from us who are struggling with reduced income in the pandemic. I will never fly with this airline again.",,,,,
" Accra to Freetown. Terrible service. 4 hours before our scheduled flight and cancelled our flight. There was no notice from the airline, we received the email after we were told that it was cancelled. The customer service response was not professional. When asked for why it was cancelled, we were notified that it was a technical problem which is surprising that 4-hours before the flight, only then did they think about confirming a cancelled flight. Normally, airlines would provide compensation to make sure the customer is not inconvenienced. Their first question was, ""do you have a place to stay here in Ghana?"" This of course should not be the first question to ask a customer who is not from the country. Had it not been for the collective anger and frustration of all passengers on the original flight, there would not have been any quick movement to get us on another flight. Even though it is a small airline or growing airline, the experience was more frustrating for us as a customer. Lastly, the manager or person in charge of transferring us to another flight did not care enough to get our contact information to notify us that we had successfully been transferred to another flight. Instead, when we happened to pass by again he looked at us surprised saying ""Why are you here? You should be checking in right now at the other airline!"". When we were never told of such thing at all. Overall, a frustrating experience and not looking to book with Africa World Airlines ever again. I would hope to be wrong and they improve, but the stress and risk of surprise cancellation are not worth entertaining the cheaper fare. I cannot comment on inflight experience because - well, I didn't fly with them.",,,,,
"  Accra to Kumasi. The flight was cancelled three times. I book the flight 2pm which was more expensive than travelling in the evening, but at long last I travel in evening which I don't like. And when I was coming was the same cancellation also three times cancellation",,,,,
"  Kumasi to Accra. Very bad service, my flight was delayed over 2hours and there was no communication from the staff as to the time we will board the flight. Neither did they show any sense of sympathy towards our being delayed. They completely ignored us knowing that there’s not much we can do. It mess up my business trip . I will surely not use this service again.",,,,,
"  
Tamale to Accra. Good onboard service, juice snack and a meat pastry. Thing that let it down was pre flight experience. Their online card payment system for the flight never works. It charged me twice for my flight and their customer service call centre is so shocking that after one month of trying they didn’t refund. Had to do a charge back through my card. They then cancelled my booking although I had still paid. They didn’t tell me they had cancelled it. I luckily checked my booking 2 hours before the flight.",,,,,
"  Domestic flight Accra-Tamale. 1hr flight. One time in both directions. Water, juice and snack (fish or meat pie, savoury biscuits) provided on this short flight (more than you get on BA domestic/European flights three days). Friendly and very polite cabin crew. Marvellous captain who gave great information about the flight. Joint venture between Hainan Airlines (China), Hahn Airways and Ghanian investors. An excellent service which makes domestic travel much easier in Ghana",,,,,
I bought the ticket in February to travel to Kinshasa in April - in March all flights were cancelled because of the conflict in Libya. I went to the travel agency to ask about what I should do - the answer was to wait until the end of the conflict. Agency was unable to rebook me or to transfer to other airlines. I am having difficulties to find their offices in London or contacts - can someone help. I have lost my money and time and no one to help.,,,,,
Gatwick to Joburg (troubles just beginning to brew in Libya). The start seemed off putting when I noticed an extra three hours on the flight time from Tripoli to Joburg which the booking office could not explain also when I was not on the reservations list at check-in. However the latter was sorted without hassle. Service on flight to Tripoli was fine plane new and clean food good. However we landed in a sandstorm which was worrying. Fortunately we were herded along to the departures lounge as all signs in Arabic. Onward flight delayed by a couple of hours due to sandstorm. Toilets at the airport were inadequate in number but reasonably clean. We were then taken on what felt like a mystery tour on an airport bus down a dirt road - turned out to be to the other end of the runway where our plane sat all on its own amidst military aircraft. The three hour extra time was now clear as it was a much smaller plane than expected (a few passengers had seats allocated on row numbers which were not on the smaller plane - however there was enough room and extra for everyone boarding). Once again food and service fine. There was a refuelling stop at Kinshasa. During my week in S Africa the revolution in Libya took off. I expected to lose my money and have to rebook myself back on an alternative carrier. However when I contacted Afriqiyah in Joburg they said I was re-booked on Egyptair travelling back same night as my original booking. They sent me email confirmation and my trip home went smoothly. The Afriqiyah staff were helpful and efficient in spite of what was obviously a stressful time for them. On the basis of value for money Afriqiyah is excellent but be prepared for a journey with a difference.,,,,,
I booked a flight to Lagos via Tripoli. We had delays at Gatwick but once in Tripoli we were told to wait two days for our connecting flight to Lagos which - totally unacceptable. We stayed in the airport from early Mon morning until monday evening stranded without any local currency and offered refreshments approx 11am. After a lot of protest we were put on flight approx 8pm that evening. This was my first experience with Afriqiyah and will be my last - despite the savings it wasn't worth the terrible experience. The lack of communication in Tripoli was disgraceful and =on the plane the staff were curt.,,,,,
BRU-JNB-BRU with a stopover in Tripoli. There were some troubles with the in-flight entertainment. On our way to JNB there were not enough headsets so we couldn't use the inflight entertainment. On our way back from JNB to Tripoli the inflight entertainment in our part of the plane didn't work at all. The food was okay and the cabin crew friendly. It's definitely value for money but there are some things to improve.,,,,,
LGW-TIP-LGW on A320/A330. Both flights approx 1 hour delayed Servisair lounge at LGW basic and overcrowded quiet lounge in Tripoli. Uncrowded flights - very few pax in Business cabin. Comfortable seats for 3 hr journey but angled lie-flat seats on A330 too short for me (1.80m). Food tasty (no alcohol of course) limited but OK film choice on AVOD. FAs sweet but not all spoke english. Be aware Tripoli airport can be difficult to navigate as all signage in Arabic only!,,,,,
We flew to Johannesburg from London Gatwick via Tripoli to attend the World Cup. All flights near enough on time and a smooth transit through Tripoli. Tripoli airport is not too bad although I wouldn't like to spend more than a few hours there. The entertainment was good food as good as expected the were polite (but spoke little English) and the seats comfortable with sufficient leg room. I did get the impression that the staff were probably a little too laid back at times. Overall the value for money was excellent the customer service was good and the planes were modern (although they did need cleaning up a bit.),,,,,
Firstly the take off was delayed with no announcements when we asked at the desk they just said 'we will go when we go'! Once on the plane we noticed it is empty so we had extra space but it looks like they failed to clean properly my table was covered in food smears when I asked for a wet towel to wipe it off I was told to 'just relax man just chill'! It was almost funny how clueless they were! Staff were friendly but no idea of customer service or professionalism. The quality of the food seems to be dependant of the airport you last left leaving SA or the UK the food was ok with a North African theme but when we left Tripoli the food was inedible. The flights are dry so they only serve warm juice or soda. The movies are heavily censored at first it's quite amusing but it gets irritating after a while. Woman's shoulders are blurred out and they even censor out all references to alcohol or gambling but blood death & murder are all good! Tripoli Airport is awful you can barely breath for the smoke and there's no organisation it's like going back it time.,,,,,
London Gatwick - Tripoli - Accra return. Tripoli to Accra was delayed a little as only one scanner was working so when they started boarding about half the passengers were still on the wrong side of the security check. The other flights were on time. Food good seats comfy checked luggage was where it should be price was excellent. Having read previous comments here I had to see how bad the loos at Tripoli airport could be and was disappointed : clean and even soap in the dispenser!,,,,,
London -Johannesburg via Tripoli return. I took the precaution of travelling hand luggage only and making sure not to use the bathrooms during the stop over at Tripoli and was pleasantly surprised. The service matched any I've travelled with over the years and at half the price. Considering they offer the option of twice as much luggage in the hold as any other airline I've travelled with I might even travel with lots of luggage next time!,,,,,
CDG-TIP-OUA out ABJ-TIP-CDG return. Excellent flight to TIP clean new A330 with good food and friendly staff. Flight to OUA similarly well presented. Unfortunately the flight from ABJ-TIP was operated by Nouvelair on Afriqiyah's behalf other passengers also noticed the difference with grumpy staff and terrible food. Happy to return to CDG with Afriqiyah again and more good service.,,,,,
Crew dreadful food cold - delays from start to finish on outbound and inbound. Tripoli is the filthiest most hostile place and staff bully passengers especially female. We were delayed for 8hrs and no one would help. They all smoke in the no smoking areas the toilets have to be seen to be believed. Brand new planes are good but there the value stops - it is just not worth the saving on flight costs.,,,,,
"London Gatwick-Tripoli-Johannesburg return. I booked on price so my expectations were fairly low. The first three sectors were more or less on time fourth just under 30 minutes late. I was pleasantly surprised to find LGW check-in desk open nearly 4 hours before the scheduled departure time! Airline food is rarely very good in economy but Afriqiyah's compared quite favourably with most. My only criticism is that a couple of dishes were quite spicy - and a choice was not always offered. I was pleasantly surprised by the in-flight entertainment which had a modern touch-screen interface and seemed to be reliable. Legroom was good. For me the only negative issue really was Tripoli Airport. The departure lounge is small and not very comfortable. There were people smoking despite ""no smoking"" signs. Maybe smoking is only allowed in certain areas but the smoke carries everywhere. The toilets are in serious need of modernisation too. I was glad I didn't have to spend long there. The staff there were pleasant and helpful though. I would consider flying with Afriqiyah again if the price is right especially once the expansion and upgrading of Tripoli Airport is complete.",,,,,
"In June 2009 I booked a trip from London to Cape Town (via Tripoli) with Afriqiyah Airways leaving on Christmas day for about £400 - a pretty good deal. However in September they decided to stop in Johannesburg instead and booked us a transfer from Johannesburg to Capetown. Alas on our way out after an unscheduled stop in Paris to pick up ""a few passengers"" and a 4-5 hour unexplained delay in Tripoli we missed the connecting flight and had to pay £200 each for new tickets - despite reassurances from Afriqiyah Airways in Tripoli that they had transferred us onto later flights. In the end we were travelling for over 24 hours. On the way back the travel documents we used to travel out were not accepted in Johannesburg airport and we had to call the UK from a mobile to get further details. Once again we got stuck in Tripoli airport for over ten hours due to snow at Gatwick. Tripoli airport is awful - it is one giant ashtray with disgusting toilets. Despite the lovely planes this was the worst airline experience I have had.",,,,,
I flew to Johannesburg via Brussels and Tripoli return. Flight attendants great who provided a cheerful and competent service. One even went to the business class to get me a lovely cup of coffee when he realised coffee was crucial to my travelling pleasure! Yes there were delays in Tripoli - but immigration officials were welcoming and we were kept fully informed as to the reasons for hold up. Toilets in Tripoli are as bad as everyone else suggests - do avoid. Useful to know that they accept Euros in their Duty Free and cafe.,,,,,
I have used Afriqiyah Airways for four return trips Gatwick - Accra over the last 14 months. Treatment has been unfailingly good. Yes there have been delays but informed of the reasons for the delays and on one occasion we were given drinks while we waited to go into the airport. The cabin crew are excellent and value for money is good.,,,,,
London-Tripoli-Johannesburg. Tripoli airport toilets are so bad you really have to be desperate to use them. Airline good value for money. Cabin crew not very cheerful looked tired all times. The only reason I would fly with them again is value for money but more friendly and cheerful cabin crew needed. A330 plane has good leg room and clean but the A320 plane not much leg room and needs cleaning up.,,,,,
Tripoli - London Gatwick - Tripoli. New plan good entertainment attentive service. No problems apart from painfully slow Check-In at Gatwick and no alcohol.,,,,,
Dakar-Tripoli-Gatwick. Fantastic seats and legroom. Food was good as was in-flight entertainment. Friendly efficient cabin staff. Late departure but arrived on time. Price lower than alternative carriers.,,,,,
Lagos to Tripoli was ok except the deplorable condition of the toilet no inflight entertainment cabin crews were boring beyond description meal was ok. Landed at Tripoli airport on time and cheerful ground crew. I have never seen a worse and appalling toilets like what I saw at the Tripoli airport. Tripoli to Gatwick flight was ok a better and newer aircraft more responsive cabin crew inflight entertainment though without headset arrived Gatwick on time. Return flight was almost a replication of the inbound flights except that there was headset for inflight entertainment. Afriqiyah should replace aircraft flying Lagos leg its below international standard and they dare not fly such aircraft to Gatwick. Will fly them if they improve on the hygiene,,,,,
Dubai - Tripoli - Dakar. All in all the flight experience was a pleasure with very good food good seat space and regular drinks - the spare seat next to me also helped. It was also good not to have the flight constantly interrupted by announcements of one kind or another in three different languages as seems to be the trend these days. Tripoli airport isn't a pleasure but no worse than you would expect and every landing seemed calmer than I am used to on the bigger planes. Two big faults though: firstly we had to turn the plane around for a sick passenger and no one made any announcement until about 5 seconds before landing which made most of us think we had turned around for a plane fault. Secondly on the outward flight my bags arrived two days late. Not a disaster for me but certainly it could have been for some people. No apology no attempt to trace me when the bag arrived (though they said they were just about to). Also only 3 movies for 26 hours of flying. Very cheap and comfortable.,,,,,
London - Tripoli - Accra. Have to say that in both directions a pleasant and trouble free flight. Onboard catering was fine and Coach class seating exceeded standard specs both pitch and quality of seats. New aircraft but remember that this is a dry airline so no alcohol available. Overall I would be happy to fly with them again.,,,,,
The airline has improved since I first started travelling with them4 years ago. The airplanes are new food is great seats comfortable and staff are improving. However the baggage service is a big disgrace. At the airport in Mali the service is useless and at the office in Bamako they cannot tell us anything. So until Afriqiyah can improve this I will not be travelling Afriqiyah again.,,,,,
Gatwick to Accra. I was not disappointed with the quality of service - time seat cleanliness entertainment and food. Each section of the trip proceeded smoothly and I felt comfortable. Whilst the airline was superb I was disappointed with the toilet facilities at Tripoli. On both the outbound and the inbound flights I have never seen an international airport with deplorable and unhygienic toilets like the ones I saw in Tripoli.,,,,,
Ouagadougou to Gatwick - the plane which was due to leave Ouaga at 1.00 am arrived at 4am & departed at 5am. I asked one of the ground staff before departure if I could possible catch the connecting flight at Tripoli which was due to leave at 8.30 am considering that it was a 4 hours flight to Tripoli and 2 hours time difference in advance. I was reassured more than once that I will catch the plane and even a message had been sent to wait for me there. I boarded the plane with a lot of apprehension and when we arrived at Tripoli I was not surprised to find that the plane had left without me 2 hrs earlier. I contacted Afriqiyah staff and they looked embarased and didn't know what to do with me - I had to stay in the airport lounge till the next day when one of the staff took somehow pity on me & upgraded my ticket to the first class. Food is not bad inflight service good and 48 kg baggage allowance for somehow modest ticket price.,,,,,
I travelled London Gatwick-Tripoli-Douala with Afriqiyah recently. Arriving 4 hours late at 01.00 hours I discovered that my luggage and that of most of the other passengers was not on the plane. I could get no information from staff at the airport but was told that I would have to wait until Monday for the next scheduled flight to see if it was forwarded. With my schedule completely ruined and no change of clothing I had to book a hotel at my own expense and wait till Monday. I spent most of Monday at the airport trying to get information without success. Finally at 22.30 I was reunited with my luggage. Some passengers on that flight also did not get their luggage. I will not be using this airline in future even if it is still the cheapest deal.,,,,,
Gatwick-Accra-Gatwick and found the journey up to expectations. On time both directions and the onboard staff very attentive without being fussy. The let-down was Tripoli airport on arrival from Gatwick: very scruffy and down-at-heel and staff bullying passengers into line for us to obtain Boarding Cards for the Tripoli-Accra leg of the journey. Information was less than brilliant too. The return transfer was a better but that's probably because I knew what to expect! Afriqiyah Airways are good value in my opinion.,,,,,
London-Tripoli-Dakar returning in June. Much better than charter flights from Paris or charters to Gambia. Very few people on all legs of the flight meant that everyone could stretch out over 3 seats fast and efficient check-in I was told I could have taken 40kg but the ticket issued through last minute.com only said 23kg. Entertainment good western and arabic films interesting documentary and tapes of Koran. Staff responsive but dont fuss laid back will give extra food plenty of drinks. Food all Halal and more'real than that served on 'western flights' but the same on return. Delay at Gatwick but they held all connecting flights in Tripoli. Planes modern and clean. Staff helpful and responsive in Dakar in changing return flight for under £50. Good cheap way to get to West Africa. This is an airline that caters for ordinary people and adequately meets those needs.,,,,,
Afriqiyah Airways customer service is non-existent. I travelled from London via Tripoli to Cameroon last December. I lost my luggage - I am still to be compensated and nobody seem to care. I will think twice before travelling again with this airline.,,,,,
Have just flown to and from Tripoli. They were late leaving Gatwick on the outward journey due to missing passengers and luggage having to be removed but check-in etc was fine although we only had hand luggage. We returned on a new A320 Airbus. We left Tripoli on time and touched down at Gatwick on the dot. The service was fine and the food was acceptable.,,,,,
" Just don't travel with this company. It's simply not worth it. It's not a trustful company. It was my first try with it, but they have already disappointed me. They cancelled my return flight Paris to Sao Paulo with a message saying only: ""your flight is cancelled. If you need to contact us, go to our webpage or call us on xxxx number (0,06 euros per minute)"". I tried to call immediately, and I didn't get any answer. I tried many times. Then I requested a refund through the online form and I'm waiting to see how much time they will take and how much they will actually refund once their policy says they do not refund services fees, which they put up the double price of the actual flight. My guess is that they do that very often to oblige costumers to fly with them when they want, or when they have enough passengers. They cancel your dates and then you will have to rebook your flight to another date which they will impose to you and which may be the one there are enough passengers. I won't do that though. I will get my refund, whatever they refund and never deal with them anymore.",,,,,
" Kiev to Paris. So, I bought tickets 1.5 months before the trip. Unfortunately, plans had changed, I had to cancel my trip. I also purchased insurance for cancellation with tickets. So a week before the flight, I wanted to cancel my tickets. I tried to call for 3 days in a row to their support line and every time I was listening to music for 10-15 minutes and getting billed for that (calling from abroad is quite expensive), but no one ever picked up the phone (during their official business hours). I sent multiple emails about my request - no reply. I tried to submit multiple requests via manage my booking on their website - but every time I tried to submit I got the ticket number with status closed right away and no ability to check it. So, in the end, I just lost my money and their insurance is worthless as nobody will ever get back to you. Do not recommend at all. First time seeing such big company who does not care about their customers at all. And their website has a lot of bugs as well. Find another company to flight with.",,,,,
"  I visit my parents regularly in Paris, I always use Air France, Transavia, or Middle east airlines. But today was the first and last flight with this Aigle Azur. On the passport my name is Ludovic while on the ticket its Ludwig. The family name is the same. So because of 3 letters difference, they want to charge 80 euros. Why changing 3 letters cost 80EUR? This is how you lose passengers. ",,,,,
"  It was my first time flying with Aigle Azur. To be honest, I didn't choose it, but Hainan Airlines. To start with, we took off with more then 2 hours delay without notifications. It wasn't the airport issue, but the company problem, because we had to wait for the plane to arrived from Sao Polo. I will skip the on-board service. So we arrived with 2 hours delayed, and, with other customers, we have a connection flight to Shanghai. This second flight is Hainan Airlines. Obviously the flight didn't wait for us. No one to received us after landing to give instructions or anything. When we asked to change the connection flight ticket at Hainan counter, we are told ""Aigle Azur didn't confirmed the delay in your flight, so we can't change your flight ticket"". The company is late and didn't even assume its responsibility. As a result, we had to pay for an other flight ticket, Aigle Azur customer service doesn't even exist / isn't reachable. Worst airline I experienced, I should have considered to read the reviews about this airline first. ",,,,,
"  Berlin to Paris. Flight on time, clean and modern plane. It was impossible to buy any drinks due to an issue with their visa machine. The crew was ok but they could smile a bit more. At Orly airport, we had to disembark by bus, which took 10 minutes to finally be at the south terminal.",,,,,
  Beirut to Paris. Worst experience ever! I booked online a two way ticket for a very tight scheduled business flight and after taking the money from my bank account a few days later i received a notification that the return flight was rescheduled to two days later which does not suite me although tickets offerings for the same date were still available on many sites online. A couple of days later the original return flight was totally cancelled. I was later offered in return another ticket two days earlier or full refund. Upon choosing the full refund I got back less than 40% of my paid amount for this trip and the argument was that they only full refund the return ticket that was changed and the outbound ticked is non refundable. The funniest thing is that the cancelled flight was charged much less than the outbound flight and this was the only amount subject to full refund. I never recommend Aigle Azur. I rate this act as a sort of phishing. They lie to you about cheap available flights and then reschedule it based on their interest so you will be the only and major loser for cancelling if the rescheduling does not suite you.,,,,,
"  Berlin to Paris Orly. Bought the ticket online a week ago and it was impossible to add a luggage. I connected on the official Website add my luggage for 25 eur, received a mail saying it was charged. Checked the morning of my flight and no luggage added, no money debited. Tried all morning to add a luggage on the bugged website. Declined, declined they it seemed to work since it displayed the total amount of the flight and the luggage of 25eur. To discover at check in that that did not work and that they would charge me the double. Not good. Second time with Aigle Azur and always an issue. Definitely the last time.",,,,,
"Basel Mulhouse to Algiers on 19/03/206. It was scheduled for 14:50 and departed at 20:06, without any explanation, excuse or apology. The only representative the company had at the airport could not give any information, nor provide any help to the hundreds of passengers stuck at the airport. What is even worse is that the company has no customer service to contact, no telephone number and no email address. The only way to contact the company is through a form on their website to which you will never get any answer ever! ",,,,,
Paris Orly to Lisbon new airline for me seat and leg room average but if your traveling with baggage the 20kg baggage allowances included in the fare makes Aigle Azur worth considering. Cabin crew did a quick run through the cabin with a (paid) drinks cart then duty free cart and promptly disappeared behind the curtain for the rest of the flight. The airline appears to be unsure of its identity although they provide a baggage allowance they are not a full service airline as this flight was over a meal time (dinner) no food or snack service provided but not a LOCO as no food was available for purchase either so we went hungry!,,,,,
Porto to Paris Orly on ZI 312 (A320) on 28 March 2014. First time on this airline and I'm a little bit unimpressed with check-in at Porto Airport. No effort to direct passengers to correct boarding desks hence I ended up in the web-check in/bag-drop queue with passengers who had not even checked in online. Thankfully queue was processed within 20 minutes and got to the gate with plenty of time to spare. My seat was next to the emergency exit so I had plenty of legroom. Seat itself was comfy and perfect for a nap. Crew extremely professional and always had a smile on their faces. Flight took off on time and landed smoothly in Paris-Orly 20 minutes ahead of scheduled arrival time. Once on the ground we were told by the cabin crew that the captain of this Aigle Azur flight had piloted his last flight so we promptly congratulated him as we departed the aircraft. All in all Aigle Azur was worth the money that I paid . Not sure if I'll have another chance to travel on them again but if they have routes that I want to fly I'll keep them in mind.,,,,,
BSL-ALG-BSL on A320 both legs. First time flown ZI and overall was an impressive experience. The cabin was quite clean and the seat was quite comfortable with good pitch. Warm and delicious meal for 2 hrs flight was a very good service. Another positive was the 30 kg free baggage for all economy class passenger.,,,,,
"Lyon to Oran. Two Airbus A320 are mainly dedicated for operations between Lyon ad Algeria. I would allow that the service tends to decrease. I can't stand how Aigle Azur operates ""charter planes with high density configuration for regular flights between France and Algeria. It is unbearable to get sat so tight in those seating rows impossible to move or eat correctly.",,,,,
I did some flights with Aigle Azur on Paris - Hassi Messaoud route (Algeria for those who are not familiar). This flight has only one type of customer: oil & gas people. I have found the service as fair overall crew friendliness and meals are actually in good category (crew friendlier then Air France). It's a pity Aigle Azur does not have baggage transfer handling agreement at CDG which means that each time we transit at CDG to / from other airlines we need to go through the immigration to recover our luggage no automatic transfer between Aigle Azur and other airlines at CDG (leading to LOSS of luggage at CDG for those not in the know such as in my case). I hope they could one day operate inside Algeria (the company owner is Algerian - French) since with the local monopoly by Air Algerie the service is non existent.,,,,,
Have flown Paris Orly to Oran return several times over the last three months. Whilst there have been some delays this has not always been due to the airline. Air crew seem extremely helpful carrying children and baggage to seats etc. Overall service much better that I would have expected and a generous luggage allowance.,,,,,
"  The most dirty airplane I’ve been in, gum sticked to the chairs, drops of dry dirt everywhere, the table is dirty also something was poured on it and wasn’t cleaned.",,,,,
"  Very nice cabin, comfortable seats and good entertainment systems. The food tasted very good and there was enough food for the flight length. The flight attendants were all very friendly except 1 steward. (Plane: 7T-VJA, Date: 8 July 2019).",,,,,
"  Paris to Oran. Very bad service for an extremely expensive price. The plane cabin was dirty, the seats uncomfortable. The cabin crew were incompetent and very haughty. Take this airline only when absolutely necessary. If you choose to spend your vacation it is a very bad choice. Unfortunately this company puts our country to shame",,,,,
"  Amman to Barcelona via Algiers. I would not recommend this airlines at all. During my trip from Amman to Barcelona through Algiers, all my checked in luggage was lost, and it has not been found since. I submitted two claims, but the airline never got back to me (not answering phone or email). ",,,,,
"  London to Algiers. There was a slight delay, but the service onboard was excellent. Clean, very nice food and friendly personnel. Very pleased with the whole experience. Would fly Air Algerie again.",,,,,
"  Algiers to Paris, the worst airline ever. Aircraft is old and dirty. Flight time was delayed and postponed. The check in process at counter is very slow. The only efficiency thing is their system down time. The staff is not well trained etc.",,,,,
"  Bamako to Algiers. A 21:15 flight was delayed around 21:30. This was the first we heard anything. At around 22:30 we were told the plane would take off the next day. We were fed by 23:00. Around 00:00 shuttles started to a hotel. I got yelled at by airline personnel while boarding a shuttle. The last of us got to the hotel around 2:30 where we were dropped off with no information. The hotel was absolutely horrid. The hotel personnel shared no flight information so around noon the next day I asked for a number for the Air Algerie personnel who'd made the reservation. He picked up after about 3 calls and told me not to call back. Around 17:00 we were told to be ready to depart at 00:00. Around 23:40 2 shuttles came. There was a mad, unorganized rush to board the shuttles because there wasn't enough space. I got pushed and shoved but left behind. One shuttle left the hotel without having its door closed. Around 00:30 another shuttle came and I managed to get on. After standing in line at the airport for an hour I got a new boarding pass. I was assured that the luggage that I had handed over the previous day would be on the plane. Service on the flight was fairly decent. Plane landed around 8:00 and took off fine. The seat was absolutely filthy, however, and the bathroom was disgusting. My luggage did not come in. I tried to report my luggage as lost but was told I could not because I had no baggage claim tickets (they'd been taken by the airline when I got my new boarding pass). I was told to come back the next morning at 3:00. I got yelled at again while reporting the luggage lost.  Another passenger said that a plane from Bamako was coming in at noon and we should wait so I did. luggage came in around 12:30.",,,,,
"  Excellent flight, good service with hearty meal (starter main course dessert tea and coffee) Duty service on board. A generous pitch for economy class seats. Note the delay at departure due to the closure of Orly airport and the flights diverted to Paris CDG.
",,,,,
"  Paris to Algiers. Very good flight, excellent catering, clean plane, but crowded. The cabin is spacious for a 737, room for the legs, comfortable seat. Very good meal for a 2 hour flight. The crew is listening. Only complaint, the windows were dirty.",,,,,
"  Algiers to Montreal. The service is very bad, actually, there is nobody to whom to talk my flight was supposed to be on Tuesday at 12;40, But we flight at 1830 cause a strike. The food was  inedible. I missed my connection in Montreal to Toronto (knowing I bought my ticket 160$) And for sure, no one from Air Algerie in Montreal to receive us. I spent the night in the airport. I will never ever take this company again.",,,,,
"  Flew Air Algerie from Oran to Paris. I do not understand where this airline got 3 stars from, 1 should be more appropriate. The cleanliness, or rather lack of, is a major issue. The newer planes especially are already really dirty (food crumbs everywhere, seats are not cleaned and toilets a disgrace). Staff are a mixed bunch, some are friendly but others have never heard of politeness or friendliness. Languages spoken are Arabic and French, you can forget about English. Food is just acceptable, nothing more. Flights are usually not on time (especially flights later in the day). Legroom is, in fact, acceptable.
",,,,,
"  Air Algerie is the worst airline I have flown. Algiers-Ghardaia flight: one flight attendant, not speaking English, smallest pack of cookies to eat. Algiers to Timimoun flight (2nd May 16) cancelled, due to sandstorm - OK, but no other proposal given, had to fight to get rebooked to Adrar, 9 hours at the airport waiting. Timimoun to Oran flight od 4th May 16 - at the airport nobody knows if the aircraft will come and take passengers, not to mention that nobody knows when. 3 hours delay. Of course at the airport you can not buy anything to eat or drink (not even a bottle of water), just sit and wait. Nothing to eat onboard as well, not even peanuts nor cookies. Altogether over 6 hours with no food. Oran to Algiers flight the same day - the same situation. Nobody knows in Oran if the aircraft will depart today nor when. At the time of scheduled departure we took a taxi to Algiers not to risk missing the flight to Europe (fortunately with Lufthansa). Aircraft (ATRs 72 and B737) are old, very used, dirty. The seat covers are sticky of dirt, seat pockets full of old crumbs and rubbish. If you wish an inflight magazine, you should buy business class ticket, as it is non-existant in economy class.",,,,,
"I returned on the flight from Algiers to London Heathrow on the 20th December - the flight was over 3 hours late it was scheduled to take of at 10.20am, however 2 hours later no sign of taking off, no information given for the delay, no refreshments offered and worst no apologies specially since the staff where hovering around passengers like zombies. Anyway 2 hours later a call on the speakers said that all Air Algerie passengers should go to gate 16 for an immediate take off which was at the other end off the airport - everybody rushed to the gate thinking that we will be on air in few minutes. When we got there was a long queue and no sign of the aircraft the staff where sitting there like zombies and there was no explanation offered for the delay - about an hour later a very painful and very slow gate checking process started. Still no information on the delay however by that time it was too late anyway, the transfer to the aircraft was by bus and I waited to the last moment to present myself to the gate desk to avoid stuck in the queues unnecessarily. The waiting in the bus was like for ever and to make matters worst it seems the bus did the tour of Algiers to get us to the aircraft because it was at the other end of the runway. When I got in the aircraft I asked why the delay and I was told it was due to the baggage handlers strike. I asked why didn't Air Algerie offer any information, explanation, refreshments or apologies I was told that even the staff didn't know as they where told to carry on with their duties. Still nobody apologised until take off by the captain which was at around 13.30pm. I have championed Air Algerie over other carriers like British Airways but I am extremely disappointed and to add insult to injury I have paid £50.00 more than traveling with British Airways for the same journey. I can promise you that I will not fly with Air Algerie ever again.",,,,,
"My  flight on 1st June from Algiers to Lisboa (Portugal) was a nightmare. The check in was extremely slow and the sequence of spot check was complicated. All forms were in French and fortunately I knew some words, but most of the guests got confused. The aircraft was very old and food was lousily prepared. The toilet was like a public non-cleaned toilet for years. Seats were not comfortable and some could not be reclined. But the captain and crew were nice, particularly since they knew I was from Vietnam and they talked in both french and english nicely. Appreciated when they found the lost wallet of my friend. ",,,,,
"Lille to Algiers. The flight has been delayed (2hrs), but the Air Algerie's airport workers gave us some sandwiches and soft drinks to apologize for the delay, a good point. The cabin crew were very professional. The aircraft (B767) was clean and in a good shape. The meal was excellent. Tea, coffee, and soft drinks have been served inflight. We landed smoothly at Algiers. The ticket price was good, and includes in it 30kg of luggage. A very good experience with Air Algerie.",,,,,
ALG-CDG-ALG Dep 14/01/14 Ret 21/01/14. Very nice trip with my wife and my son (2 years old). No delay B737-800 sky interior not very clean and the cabin crew are not professional. Very good meals and wine. The price was cheap (450 euros for 2 adults and 1 child).,,,,,
Had a scheduled flight from Algiers to Annaba at 10.30 and a return flight at 17.30hrs. Algiers to Annaba 4 hour delay no explanation no assistance was supplied. Annaba to Algires 2.30 hours delay no explanation no assistance was supplied. Old and dirty planes FA's neither friendly or helpful. Ground staff very unfriendly did not speak English either.,,,,,
Flight Paris CDG - Algiers. Flight was more than 3 hours late and no explanations were given by the Air Algerie ground staff. The aircraft was old and very dirty. Food was still on my seat. Cabin crew were very unprofessional and not friendly at all. Food was ok. Only one toilet was in service. I will never fly again with Air Algerie.,,,,,
Paris to Algiers then to Ouagadougou and back. Overall I found this airline good value for money: they are cheap and offer minimal service. The aircraft's were old but kept in a good state except for the washrooms which were disgusting. Seats were rather comfortable. On the Algiers-Ouagadougou leg 1st class seating was attributed randomly to economy passengers. The meals were excellent even on the shorter Paris-Algiers flights. The food is halal but wine is available. Of my 4 flights only one was late by about one hour. No information whatsoever was given while we were waiting but the crew apologised once we were let in.,,,,,
"Nov 1 Algiers-Ghardaia by ATR 72. 1 hrs late departure due to late arrival of the aircraft. Confusing as destination ""Oran"" was shown at the departure gate. Flight full. Some biscuits water and a soft drink was provided. Announcements in French and Arabic only. It is a domestic flight but on arrival and departure immigration has to been cleared. Return Nov 3 Flight on-time long wait for the luggage in Algiers because of a parking problem. Airline recommended as flying is better than 10 hrs by bus.",,,,,
DXB-ALG. 4 hours delay without explanation and they didn't give us anything for this. The aircraft (A330) was pretty old the bathrooms were disgusting and the plane was dirty! Very poor service on-board and cabin crews are not professional. The food was not appealing. The overall service was very poor!,,,,,
BRU-ALG-BRU. Both flight were late - more than 4 hours on the return flight. Food on board is average. The plane was not very clean and looks old. Personal friendly but not very helpful in the airport.,,,,,
London Heathrow to Algiers on an old 767. Cabin crew are simply not professional food wasn't appealing and toilets were filthy.,,,,,
Frankfurt to Annaba this Summer return. The age of the plane from FFM to Alger was pretty old. The Alger- Annaba flight the same. On the return both planes were new. There was no delay. Service on the ground and onboard is ok. Food was excellent even during Ramadan. Take care at the Airport especially on the way from the international to the domestic Airport in Alger! Don't give anybody your papers except if you are sure they are really officials.,,,,,
ALG-MRS. 3 hours delay and no explanation. Only drinks were offered for this 1hr 10mins international flight. Flight attendants are really not professional.,,,,,
LYS-ORN. Clean and new aircraft FA's could be a little more professional. Nice complete meal. I am used to taking this airline to go to Algeria and it is really improving.,,,,,
ALG-AAE. The flight to Annaba took 1hr and was uneventful. Air Algerie will always serve you a drink and a close an eye to your baggage allowance which is good. But service is non-descript and like many airlines of North Africa when there is a problem there is nobody to speak to and nobody is responsible for anything. So when flying them have lots of time on your hand patience and a good book. Their prices are usually good especially for domestic flights. Would fly them again but as I said it is nothing memorable.,,,,,
TUN-ALG in the new 737-800NG (Business Class) a very good trip no delay good meat (champagne before take off). On time at Algiers clean cabin a very large seat and big space not like Air France or Alitalia in Business Class.,,,,,
NIM to YUL. Planes were new and clean (B737-800 and A330) on time crew was friendly and helpful. I had a stop in Algiers for 5 hours the staff at Algiers Airport were friendly too. A very good experience and the cheapest prices. Reading experiences from others it seems like I was lucky.,,,,,
Algiers to London the flight was fine save for the lack of information in English. Lunch wasnt great and the toilet was messy. Aircraft was a newish 737.,,,,,
I have decided to give up on Air Algerie after waiting nearly 3 days for a flight from Heathrow with 2 small children. The airline is a joke - you have to wait at least 3 hours before they tell you your not flying. We had 2 pay for my 2 young children nearly the full fare and then was told to give up a seat as they had overbooked. I am not from Algeria my husband is though - Algeria is like my second home. I feel that the Air Algerie gives the country a bad name - it should pull its socks up and start following the other airlines.,,,,,
I am an Algerian living the south East of England for last 24 years. My family and I use to fly Air Algerie from London to Algiers about twice a year. The service and the London office became so bad that it was almost impossible to buy a ticket. When Air Algerie was the only airline flying to Algeria people had to travel to London to buy their tickets. In the last few years more European airlines started to fly to Algeria. A lot of Algerians living in the UK prefer to fly Algeria via a connecting flight (Rome Milan and Paris) than flying with Air Algerie. The price of the ticket was in most cases more expensive. More recently BA started flying to Algiers from London and this provide us an alternative option. My family and most of our friends fly with BA with travelling to London. I think Air Algerie provides better food than BA but the FA on the BA flights project a more professional image.,,,,,
The service is a shambles! I have travelled with Air Algerie more than 6 times since July 05. Their systems need to be modernised! No allocated seating carry your own suitcase to the porters on the runway cabin crew never smile or ask if you are okay. Baggage allowance for different people. The only positive comment is they serve relatively hot food. What saddens me more than anything is the fact that the flight is so short it doesn't take alot to make it a good flight! The price you pay is extortionate in comparison to what you receive!,,,,,
I have never encountered an airline where the passengers themselves have to collect the luggage from the runway! This happened to me thrice with Air Algerie: Lyon to Constantine 2002 Lyon to Annaba 2004 and Constantine to Paris 2005. I am afraid Air Algerie had a lot to learn to be internationally competent.,,,,,
What a disappointment! Air Algerie need to improve if their star rating and credibility with other operators is to be upped. My ticket was purchased in the UK through an independent travel broker. No problems there but the ticket was not available for collection when I arrived to check-in at Heathrow. The incompetent Air Algerie rep then took one hour to sort this problem out. To add insult to injury I was flying business class but did not get to see the lounge or do any shopping as the check-in desk had closed by the the time my problem had been resolved. Business class on Air Algerie is a joke. The only additional privilege I could see was an extra four inches of leg room. The interior of the aircraft was shabby the upholstery was dirty and there was even old food and hair in the table stowage area. The food was ok and the service was relatively attentive but I couldn't help but think that it was all a bit too much of an effort for the staff. Come on Air Algerie. Get a grip on your customer service priorities refurbish the aircraft change the menu provide service with a smile - and keep the cabin clean!,,,,,
I'm an Algerian living in Ottawa Canada. I fly with Air Algerie every two years for my vacation to Algeria. I always leave Montreal or Toronto for some European city and then connect with Air Algerie to Algiers. I also use Air Algerie domestically when i arrive to fly Algiers-Annaba. Flying with them every two years has given me the privilege of seeing the airline grow and IMPROVE. The food is great and plentiful even on the 2h flights from Paris and Frankfurt and the 1h30min. flights from Casablanca. Most other airlines don't even offer HOT meals on such short flights. I find their planes to be quite nice and they are trying to improve them. They phased out the 727s and 732s leaving only the newest and best also adding to it the Airbus 332s. The extension of the International terminal at Algiers gives you a more comfortable and modern lounge/check-in area and hopefully with the completion of the new terminal it will be even better. I find their only problem to be frequent delays. Other than that good service and good planes.,,,,,
Lyon to Annaba on Air Algerie yesterday. My father who lives in Annaba flies Air Algerie regularly on work and is absolutely fed up with the airline. At Lyon one corner had been allocated for Air Algerie check-in. It seems even the airport authorities have given up on that corner. A good amount of chaos. In the line before the immigration gate few Algerians broke the wire cordon jumped in and broke the queue in spite of being reprimanded by airport officials. Boarding was disorganized with no priority boarding for business class or for the elderly. Upon entering the plane I discovered that seat numbers meant nothing. My seat was occupied and the FA politely told me I could sit anywhere! Food was horrible. They ran out of water bottles and started serving water in glasses poured out at the back of the aircraft. The water had a fair amount of salt in it. Upon landing at Annaba it took us over an hour to get out of the chaotic airport despite having cleared immigration in 10 minutes. Basically the bags took that long to come out and this when the Lyon flight was the only flight that arrived at the airport that time...when we landed there was not a single aircraft other than ours (domestic or international!!),,,,,
I live in London . I agree with all the negative points said by the people in the comments and I would like to add that it is impossible for people to get through the phone to contact Air Algerie agency in order to book or to buy a ticket - and if we make a booking through internet we don't get an answer that the booking has been accepted or not !,,,,,
Positives : Food quality. Recent efforts to renew the fleet. Crew friendliness Non-smoking restrictions (though I'm a smoker I consider this a plus) Negatives : Delays (too frequent). Transit lounge (poor comfort). Business & First Class lounge (poor comfort as compared to other airlines). Hygiene on board (dirty WCs sometimes even dirty seats). Inflight entertainment (non-existent). Seating allocation (non-existent). Algiers airport duty free shopping and facilities (poor standards). One of the most expensive airline for $ per distance.,,,,,
The Air Algerie fleet is totally renewed they now have brand new A330 on international routes safe and clean all flights are non smoking. The airport security is top notch. The food served onboard is good for medium range flights. Contrary to what some people say Air Algerie does allocate seats like other airlines but it is true that some passengers seem to not take that into account which tends to stress the staff into attitudes that are not very friendly during the first 15mns of boarding. Air Algerie has seen a huge improvement in service with the introduction of new planes. I recommend this airline yet I would like to see them adopt a world class frequent flyer program.,,,,,
What I don't understand is why AIR ALGERIE is not allocating seats when people check in. This creates a big confusion. It is not the passengers fault but it is the airline which doesn't allocate seats. It wasn't used to be like that in the past.,,,,,
My wife and I use Air-Algerie twice a year to go from London to Algiers and we usually use the company for internal flights as well. I can say with confidence that both security at airport and food during the flight are the best in the world. The Fleet maybe a little old but the level of maintenance carried out on the planes must be very high. The service provided by the crew is probably poor but I can assure you that the worst of Air-Algerie is the quality of the passengers. Everyone thinks the plane is his or her so he/she can seat anywhere smoke whenever they are pleased take overweighed hand luggage and use their mobile phones during the flight. I do advice people to fly with Air-Algerie but remember to be a good passenger and you will see how will be treated.,,,,,
My wife and I travel regularly between West Africa and Europe and about a year ago we decided to try Air Algerie to avoid the burden of Air France's unpleasant staff and ridiculously low checked baggage weight limits (economy: 23 kgs!). We were surprised to enjoy a relatively pleasant experience with Air Algerie (Y class) flying recent aircraft (738 and 735s) with acceptable delays (~15-30mns) and fast connections in Algiers on both legs for about half the cost of the AF ticket. The only negative side was a cold uncomfortable transit room in Algiers airport on the outbound flight. On that leg travel time incl. connection was shorter than that of AF. Given the above plus the quality and quantity of food served onboard highlighted by others I consider Air Algerie a fair alternative to Air France on Europe-West Africa routes.,,,,,
As it's the only option in Algeria I travel twice a month with Air Algerie and I can’t tell lots of things need to be done within the company itself for instance all Personnel need to have a worthy training to learn how to treat customers to improve their poor service quality.,,,,,
I fly sometimes with Air Algerie and it is not worst nor better than all other flight companies. For the security all the airplanes in world are submitted to the same safety constraints so it is not more dangerous to fly with Air Algerie than to fly with others (All Air Algerie airplanes are from the last generation Boeing or Airbus). And the greater decision Air Algerie has taken is to eliminate smoking in their airplanes. For the delays I think is problem of security which is taken really seriously by Algerian authorities and also because there are simply not enough parking place at Algiers Airport which will be resolved with the new airport.,,,,,
I am an Algerian living in London I used the the service once from London it was the most expensive horrific and time wasting in my life. It was the first and the last it took me 9 hours where it should have taken only 4. I complained to London branch manager but no action followed nor an apology.,,,,,
As an expat living in Algeria I frequently have to use the services of Air Algérie for going on business trips. As a frequent user I can only confirm what others say about Air Algérie. The planes are 90% of the time late the service is miserable and the planes are in a state where most airlines would take them out of service. Only small highlight is the consistent quality of the food which is not refined but good tasting. Air Algérie certainly is part of the Algeria experience but those who are scared of flying may not find this the most reassuring airline to go with. A word of advice as a business traveller - take business class there is a small lounge at the Airport in Algiers where you can at least pass your time when the flight is delayed.,,,,,
I fly Air Algerie on a regular basis - they are habitually late because of security. For instance when departing Algiers all passengers must identify their luggage which is laid out on the tarmac prior to boarding the aircraft. For this I have no problem. The latest I have ever been leaving Algiers is 45 minutes. It gives me ample time to catch any connecting flights to my next destination. The other reason why they are quite often delayed flying back to Algiers is because there are simply not enough parking spots at the Airport in for incoming flights therefore they wait in Paris Rome Frankfurt etc until a spot can be allocated for the aircraft. The crew is always more than accommodating with refreshments and anything they can do to assist with comfort. They have eliminated smoking on the flights but some people still light up. When this happens they tell the person to put out the cigarette and if the person refuses they are told that should they refuse to extinguish the cigarette - then once they arrivedat the destination the local authorities will be contacted this usually takes care of the problem.,,,,,
"  Atrocious customer service (the landline never answered), online complaint form never answered or vaguely answered or rarely answered. They also remove, amend, cancel what you have type on their online form (what they call e-ticket) so as to hide their suspicious activities or behaviour. You have to fight to get your money back (if you still have energy left after 3 months of constant harassment from me let alone 1 year) if it happens that you need to claim a refund. It has been a very traumatic experience for me and as far as I'm concerned this would be the last time I will be taking this airline.",,,,,
"  This airline has constant maintenance issues, the plane on arrival lost one engine. The replacement plane came in late, we were told they were in touch with the connecting airline, someone would be getting us from the plane and immediately escort us to the connecting flight. They confirmed multiple times that the connecting airline would hold. When we landed, we saw the connecting flight pull away from the gate. The connection was only available once per week. They would take no responsibility, we had to buy a ticket to another airport (Fort-de-France) to catch a connection to our destination the next day. Change fees, extra ticket, hotel for the night, taxi, food, etc. cost us $500 per person. Air Antilles lied to us every step along the way and did not cover a penny of the extra expenses they were responsible for. Do not fly this airline.",,,,,
"  Point-à-pitre to Saint Martin. This airline is disgusting. They have no respect for people or their time. They are the most unhelpful and rudest people we have ever encountered on an airline. They were unwilling to help us try to book an earlier flight, after discovering the plane was delayed two hours which would have made us late for an unexpected funeral we were to attend. Then, even though it was two hours late, they still made us go into the boarding zone, where there was no food and only warm bottles of water in an expensive vending machine. Once, the plane was finally nearing boarding time, they announced another hour of delay. Delays are common and sometimes unavoidable, However, the rudeness and complete lack of help is unacceptable. We not only felt like we were receiving attitude because we were white, we also just felt that they didn’t feel like dealing with us because they were too busy eating lunch. Unacceptable. Do not fly with them. We should not be giving them our hard earned money.",,,,,
"  My first experience with this regional airline on a short hop from Point-a-Pietre to Melville Hall. Very pleasant and relaxed flight, nice staff and decent leg and hand luggage space. Will be happy to fly with them at any time again.",,,,,
  I booked the ticket for my mother on 15.3.2023 from Sharjah to Calicut. The ticket was booked 60 days prior to traveling and direct booking from Air Arabia portal. It was with return ticket and my mother already travelled from Calicut to Sharjah 45 days back. We reached the airport two and half hours before flying and they informed your ticket is on hold. They made us to wait in the area for the entire two and half hours and informed the flight do not have seat.  The airline is so rude that they do not even care about a senior lady traveling alone and did not in any manner addressed their mistake. They did not even send any notification. ,,,,,
"  I would never recommend this airline. It was a very bad experience. The seat was dirty, with chewing gum and other debris on it, and despite informing the hostess multiple times to either change my seat or clean it, nothing was done about it. This was by far the worst travel experience I have had.",,,,,
" I have had a very terrible experience with my luggage. My luggage was left in Sharjah. When I got to Entebbe airport I was told I would get it the next day and 5 days later nothing yet. It's my first experience using this flight and I'm not sure I will use it again. Unfortunately, I have already booked a return flight with them but after my return flight. Not sure I want to ever use Air Arabia again. I am so disappointed. Then the flight set off almost an hour late from Almaty.",,,,,
  I was on flight G9291 Sharja to Tbilisi flight on 16/4/2023. I found that cabin staff Alexandra was positive and very well mannered. She was managing everything perfectly and it was a great pleasure to watch her go about her work.,,,,,
"  Helpful cabin crew. Wide distances in seating. Clean aircraft. Good treatment. Only point is waiting area in Cairo airport is bad. Professional pilot. Very bad arrival gate (northern airport) due to long time waiting at passport gate, very bad",,,,,
" It is an OK airline, not very good. Timing is punctual. They made a lot of overbooking and asking passengers (including me) whether we can postpone one day. They promised hotel stay with all expenses. I did not accept their offer due to the urgency. Food I booked and got it in fine but quantity is very small. Air India Express is far better I think.",,,,,
"  The worst airline i booked with ever, it is not comfortable and I booked flight from Delhi-Sharjah-Amman. Delay happened in Delhi but i arrived Sharjah 15 min before departure of Amman flight and it is same airline so they should wait for 10 min. Instead, Air Arabia employee took my ticket and change my flight to another flight after 6 hours and gave lunch and Breakfast vouchers which means nothing for me. I don’t recommend this airline to anyone.",,,,,
"  Flight was delayed from Doha with no reason given to passengers. However, afterwards passengers were informed this was due to weather. On return from Sharjah to Doha, in the month of Ramadan, music was played by the airline with Muslim passengers having to listen to the music. I was fed up of listening to a love song forever. Eventually after a passenger complained and it was turned down. We were informed it is computerised they can’t switch it off!",,,,,
"  Irresponsible and careless handling of our belongings. They asked me to submit my baby stroller at the aircraft and so I did. However, the stroller that I got at my destination was completely broken.",,,,,
"  Abu Dhabi to Cochin. The flight timings were great.  We were traveling with twins who are one and half year old. One has to understand that traveling with small kids is not easy let alone with twins! Cabin staff first spoke to us rudely because we had left our folded prams on the tarmac as we didn’t have free hands to bring it up since the flight did not have an aero bridge but stairs. I respect rules but there is a manner to convey the message and it cannot be rude! I did not expect her to carry my bags/prams but I do expect some understanding and courtesy. Secondly, when I requested her to clear the food tray so that my toddler wouldn’t make a mess she seemed to have a problem with that too and was sulky when I insisted. Clearly she didn’t get the memo that in a service oriented industry customer is king I would give the person the benefit of doubt had she been new to this but she is the cabin manager and I expect better behavior from someone like that.",,,,,
"  Air Arabia charged me the equivalent of 50 euros to put my carry-on bag under the seat. This was the same bag that Ryanair, EasyJet and Air Europa all allowed me to carry for free. Air Arabia's carry-on bag restrictions are ridiculous and when I questioned the check-in person, she told me that all airlines have their own restrictions and later that it was not her problem. I wrote to 'customer service' who simply told me that they suggest people limit the amount of carry-on they bring and refused my request to be reimbursed for a ridiculously small carry-on allowance. I got nothing I didn't get on the 3 other low-cost airlines I traveled with except a little green tag on my bag, indicating that I had been properly cheated & could therefore carry my bag on and place it under the seat in front of me, as I did with the 3 other low-cost airlines for free. ",,,,,
"  I am never flying with this airline again and never will recommend to anybody. I flew with Air Arabia the first time in 2017 and then I left my Pandora under my seat which I bought from Armenia on my way back to UAE. I called customer service several times but nobody was ever willing to help me and just simply said ""We found nothing"". So that's when I know this airline cannot be trusted or perhaps its crew. 2023 came and my friends decided to book with Air Arabia because it's cheaper so I had no choice but to go with them although I've already warned them how horrible the service of this airline is. We checked in online via the Air Arabia app and when we arrived at the airport, the online check in we did was actually useless as we still had to queue like the others who did not do the online one. They could've put up a separate counter for those who did the online check in like how we have in Dubai. Also, all the crew of this airline looks so evidently unhappy with their jobs that it is reflecting in their service. Getting inside the plane, nobody would even smile or even look at you.  I asked a crew to help me put my luggage up the cabin as I am a little short to reach and she said, ""You have to help me because I cannot put it up myself"". ",,,,,
"  This review relates to my experiences using Air Arabia Maroc. The website is straight forward to use but I was later frustrated when the system would not allow me to check-in online. I flew from Tangier to Gatwick on 17th February 2023 and found the check-in agent to be friendly and efficient as well as polite and clearly a gifted linguist too! The check-in process was prompt as was the departure. It was reassuring to see that security was taken seriously and several checks took place before boarding. My only gripe was that no provision was made for elderly people, disabled passengers and those with babies to have priority boarding. Some passengers were allowed to take far too much hand luggage while others were strictly controlled. A lack of consistency was apparent. The cabin crew were efficient. Service was based on those who preordered items online. The staff then performed a purchase trolley service. This service was well organised. Full credit to the staff. The seats were comfortable and a route map was used on this A320. Disembarkation was a reasonable affair but the crew were not to be seen to say farewell the passengers and the captain did not make any announcement either. The fare was very similar to that charged by larger airlines. The departure and arrival time was convenient and so I would consider flying this airline again.",,,,,
"  The check in counter staff were rude and slow, and whenever you ask them to hurry up because you're late to your flight they say you should've come earlier. Jeddah to Sharjah they forced me to pay for extra luggage for the handbag i came with from Sharjah to Jeddah. I came with this bag same bag, same weight, why you force me pay for it? Either you pay or you split the weight into two bags.",,,,,
" Had a really nice flight with Air Arabia. Great seat pitch, comfy seats and easy process all the way. Cabin was perfectly clean and crew sufficiently attentive. It was my first time on Air Arabia but it will not be the last",,,,,
" You have a great pilots, that's the only point where I may put 5*. Lets start: the crews are extremely poorly trained, turbulence doesn't give you an excuse to not serve ordered and prepaid lunch or at least to get that poor bottle of water, at least do it once landed. Connected flight...departing delay for almost an hour, crews are chatting, laughing - no one bothered to explain passengers what's happening, unless you ask, next: the passengers walking, standing for almost over an hour and talking loudly to friends or whatever - why are the crews quiet? Again lets go back to prepaid food allowance - why the sandwich was served frozen cold and the Bottle of water 200ml only? Oh these delays. Last year had the same experience, plane arriving late for an hour then definitely will depart with delay, spoiling passengers mood, can you think of those who has short time connecting flight later - why cannot you follow the time schedule. Why SHJ bus driver giving passengers instruction to leave hand luggage outside the plane under rain, my hand luggage bag suiting all the parameters and allowances, what was the bus drivers problem with it? Other luggage I received after a long wait - same Sharjah flight, was full of water inside and arrived unwrapped, can't imagine how did they kept throwing it as all new bottled stuff has been opened, absolutely every single tube opened and leaked out all the liquids. That WiFi even didn't work. $500 ++ ticket, disappointing experience!",,,,,
"  I had a terrible experience with these guys. Flight came 4 hours due to medical emergency as they said we understood but they didn’t carry none of our luggage. Whole passengers arrived at destination without luggage. It took 3 days to get out luggage that too we were helped by our friends working in Abu Dhabi airport. No Air Arabia staff showed up or came for help. The only response was from call centres we called, they were asking to email Air Arabia but ended up receiving “your situation is handled”. Really disappointing service.",,,,,
"  I booked a flight for next week mistakenly I chose November instead December. Like every one I tried to change the flight both online and by calling. Online my experience was awkward , gives the option to change one way and not both! Phone call, number in Madrid is not working and voice message tells you that . Next level, contacting customer service by email imagine after explaining to them what I have done (online and calling) they have sent to me a link to change the flight which is the same in there official site which is not working and a call center number in Morocco. This is my first I have seen an airline who does not care at all with their clients. My last option is booking another flight but not anymore with your irresponsible Company Cheers",,,,,
"  I recently flew from Ahemdabad, Gujarat, India to Tbilisi, Georgia by Air Arabia and the experience was so horrible. The ground staff was so rude. I had 30 kg allowance. And, 10 kg cabin bag. I had 9 kg in my cabin bag, and laptop in hand bag. I was trying to add extra baggage from 3 days prior to my flight. There was no option where I could add extra baggage. I called up the call centre, and even the lady was so rude. She told me the flight is booked. I asked her if what If I'm told at the check in to lay for my extra baggage? To which she replied, I don't know. So, this clearly means the flight was not booked and the customer service so nicely lied. This is not the first time it happened. I was travelling from Tbilisi to Ahemdabad in June'2022; and I was faced with the same issue. I wanted to add extra baggage. And there was no option to add. And when I called up the call centre, they said the flight is booked. This is not the way to treat the customers. This is such a bad service! I was holding my medical book in my hand. I told them I have to study in the flight. They did not let me carry the book. They made me weigh my laptop bag and my cabin bag. They asked me to pay for my laptop bag. The airport price for per kg is 1300 inr, which is comparatively eay too expensive than online prices. They clearly only wanted to loot us customers. When I told the check-in authorities about it, they clearly blamed me that I'm lying. I showed them my student residency card, telling them that I'm a student and I need my book. They didn't listen to anything. No airline checks the laptop bag. Yet, they do this to us everytime. I tried explaining them so much, no one was ready to listen. It was a horrendous experience. I would not suggest anyone to travel from this airline. And, especially if you are travelling from Ahemdabad, Gujarat I'd suggest you not to take this airline. The staff is obnoxious and ill-mannered!",,,,,
"  Do not take this airline. We had two small carry ons for our short flight from Marrakesh to Fez, but they would not allow us to take them. My friend had to check in his carry on. The reasoning? They claimed it was a full flight, but we knew that was untrue; upon entering the airplane, the flight was only half full, and there was ample space for baggage in the overhead bins. The people who checking in before us didn’t have this issue. In fact, no one else was asked to do this except for my friend.  To top this experience off, our seating arrangement was not honored even though we paid extra to have specific seats next to each other. They were randomly assigned seats totally separate from each other. Luckily the flight was (contrary to airline staff) only half full, so we seated ourselves. When traveling within Morocco, take the train. ",,,,,
"  My co passenger was suffering from headache. From his frustration since inside flight i enquired about this. So he asked for one tablet just to survive the time of fight .. no one care of this. Then he requested again, the air hostess gave him one tablet, after he asked for water. The strange thing is that they asked him for money for water. Its so strange and disappointing situation. I am so annoyed how they may consider for passengers during emergency/ medical conditions.",,,,,
"  It’s was one of the worst flight that I used, I made a online checkin and I selected a seat, which they changed it at the time of obtaining boarding pass without my consent, then the family next to me were cleaning and changing the kids diaper on the seat and didn’t consider the cabin crew instructions. The food was served after 2.5 hours to me and they didn’t accept the currency which from the flying location. Very bad service! Shouldn’t choose airlines who don’t care about their customers, even the tickets were costly.",,,,,
"  I booked family ticket from Delhi to Abu Dhabi last year to travel in December. Unfortunately travel had to be cancelled. But came to know that they don't refund the money, but allow reuse the ticket within 1 year. Now came to know that they have stopped flights to Abu Dhabi. And there are number of restrictions to re use the ticket. I think Air Arabia is worst airline where rules are made to grab travelers money. ",,,,,
"  I was on a flight from Tangier to Amsterdam, the worst flight I have experienced. A passenger had a health issue and the aircraft had to stop in France for emergency. The flight was delayed by almost 2 hours. I missed my connecting flight, and I ended up booking a hotel stay and a new flight which has cost me an arm and a leg. I also had to re-schedule other travel activities which cost me a lot of money. In total the damage was over 1,200 EUR. I raised a complaint. I never heard from them, they did not even acknowledge receiving it. The form does even accept PDFs (how would you supplement a complete compensation claim!) I had similar problems in the past, once there was a half day delay! Once I sent a request for information and never got a reply! The flight was horrible! ",,,,,
  Air Arabia reschedule my flight for 26th August instead of 25th for returning to London UK. Even they emailed me for information and issued an e-ticket. Eventually when I arrived at Kathmandu airport to fly to the UK. They couldn't find my schedule in the system. It was a blunder mistake from them. After carefully checking at Kathmandu airport then found out the airline cancelled my ticket without my authorization. Now I am still in Kathmandu n couldn't fly back and they don't refund me after their stupid mistake. Even I emailed them 10 times but not replied yet. This is their error and they should resolve it. Please be careful with this kind of airline. I don't want anyone to suffer like me. Customer satisfaction is the priority but they are after only money.,,,,,
"  I did not like the airline at all. Staff was rude, they also charge you for water.? On top of buying ticket and choosing the airline, they cant even show courtesy to provide water. That is really rude.",,,,,
"  Really atrocious service, both my flights in the same day were delayed with no solid updates on what is happening. The bus is late and thete are no staff at the gate to inform us what is happening. I personally need to get back to my home in Qatar quick and i do not appreciate all my flights being delayed by so long. Air Arabia really need to get their priorities straight and fix these constant delays. Really really bad. Worst airlines I've travelled on.",,,,,
  Worst airline for everything. Boarding late for more than 1 hour with no information for bus. Very bad attitude from the staff. Not recommended to anyone.,,,,,
"  The journey was postponed three times, from July 17 to July 18 at eight in the morning, then we got an email by changing the date until six in the morning instead of eight in the morning, so I contacted customer service to make sure that it is a deadline ،because of my mother's health condition, and security problem in Sudan and difficulty of The movement in it and the closure of the roads leading to the airport, the customer service told me that another change will happen, and the flight will be at 6 pm instead of 6 am without any email or sms notification.",,,,,
"  Give this airline a miss, at least in this route. I flew 3 budget airlines on this trip (others were Thai Smiles and Vietjet). Both were far superior on everything from check in to leaving on time (currently 5 hours past boarding time on this flight) to quality of food to keeping passengers updated. Only fly as a last resort.",,,,,
  First time I travel in Air Arabia. In food time I was sleeping. Cabin crew called my name and confirmed my name. I prepared the table for food. I already paid it while booking. But she didn't give the food to me. She gave my co passenger with same procedure. I was so embarrassed as I had prepared table for food. I don't think that it happened by mistake. She purposely done. Please do the needful. It shouldn't happened to anyone further. ,,,,,
"  I had a bitter experience of flying with Air Arabia two times, they keep on rescheduling and they are not providing stay or food. Moreover there is no feedback tab in their website. Reply from customer call center and reply mail is a nightmare. There is no refund for the cancellation tickets too and I received damaged baggage one time too.",,,,,
" Bangalore to Doha via Sharjah. Worst airline, they charged us excess as we had 4 pieces of luggage instead of 2 pieces, totalling less than 60 kgs, as allowed for us (2 travellers). This is the first time an airline is charging extra for the number of pieces, as per our ticket we could carry 60 kgs, and our luggage was less than 60 kgs, still they made us pay at Bangalore airport. Staff were very arrogant, and uncooperative. This is the first and last time with Air Arabia.",,,,,
"  The company offered no refund when canceled ticket to Ukraine. Just dropped an sms that the flight has been canceled. When I approached them in a couple of weeks, they offered three refund options to choose (exchange the flight to another destination, get a voucher for future use and a refund to the card). I responded to clarify a time-frame, during which I can respond with the destination for the first option. Instead of responding, they just proceeded with the third option (least desired by me). During back and forth communication they refused to acknowledge their mistake and offer any correction or compensation. After all they just stopped responding. To make things worse, today (in 11 days after the last interaction) I got charged again by their company - who knows for what. Now I have to pay additional money to my bank for the chargeback process to take place and wait for 60 days to get my funds back. I believe this is the worst interaction with an airline company that I've had.",,,,,
"  I just booked today and they charged me for insurance which I did not select. When I contacted them they mentioned that you cannot cancel -  you charge your customer for a service which I will not use. It's really disappointed experience, zero customer service.",,,,,
  Worst airline I have ever used. They treat us like we are flying for free. Staff here is very rude to customers and things are not even organised a bit around here. This was totally disappointing and i will never travel Air Arabia again.,,,,,
"  Worst experience ever. The flight from New Delhi was cancelled just 48 hours advance. When contacted with the call center several times (almost whole day wasted)they offered an alternative flight from Chennai or Trivandrum instead of Delhi, saying both the cities were in India. Imagine, they want passengers to travel to South India first to reach UAE. Then when I explained the customer care representative that it was almost an impossible option he said only flight till Sharjah was available. I requested a transfer, even a shuttle, bus, taxi anything could do as unlike Air Arabia we cannot change our duty schedules at 48 hours notice. The option was out rightly rejected. When requested to reach the higher officials, even that was impossible.=",,,,,
" This was the most horrible flight in my life. It was a nightmare. I booked a flight from Bishkek to Riyadh through Sharjah with this airline. They boarded me on the flight to Sharjah without a problem but in Sharjah, they denied me. The reason they gave me was that I did not have a QR code on my vaccine certificate and I am required to present an institutional quarantine package booking which I didn't have. I had to spend two nights in this terrible cold dirty airport crying all the tears my body could ever produce. The Air Arabia staff treat people like sheep. I saw them being extremely rude and disrespectful to South Asians who were in the same situation as me. On the third day, they sent me back to Bishkek where I booked the institutional quarantine and bought another fright with Flydubai. Flydubai didn't even ask me for a QR code for my vaccine certificate. Moreover, when I arrived in Riyadh the customs officer did not require a QR code and told me I do not need to quarantine. Imagine my anxiety and despair caused by these incompetent Air Arabia staff. Never in my life, I am going to purchase anything from you.",,,,,
"  Such a disgusting service. Never again. Was denied boarding for a flight from Casablanca to Basel on Dec 31 for no reason. The guy at check- in counter just said to me “you can’t get this flight without a transit visa”.  A connecting flight to my home country was departing from Basel in just 6 hours (24 hours visa-free transit is allowed in Switzerland for Russian nationals). I tried to claim compensation from the airline. They replied, but with “We don’t have any refund/cancellation policy”, didn’t even apologise. ",,,,,
"  Very pathetic service from Air Arabia. I wanted to change my meal preference. Tried changing online, but before it reach the final step, system encountered error. Tried multiple time and left with no other option other than calling customer service. Call got connected after 17 mins, and the lady kept me on hold for another 12 mins and she hanged up the call just like that. Again tried calling them back, waited for 15 mins to get the call connected. Even this time, the lady kept me on hold for more than 13 mins and came back telling that I need to pay additional. (The amount initially paid was matching with the selected meal). She told this cannot be done.. I would give Minus star for Air Arabia service.. Very unprofessional company.",,,,,
"  Total unprofessional services from Air Arabia. Zero care for passengers.  Flight got postponed for 24 hrs and Air Arabia doesn’t have any courtesy to update the reason for the change or provide any compensation or not even reasonable discussions (Only response provided is the flight changes are beyond their limit). If it is few hrs we can understand. But how can an airline justify change in flight timing for 24 hrs. I booked premium seats by paying additional amount. And when the flight got changed the new itinerary received removed seat booking just like that and they adjusted the amount as credit. If there is any change in original commitment, being an airline company, it is Air Arabia's responsibility to call customer and inform about the change or removal of some service. Rather they expected customer call them back and the worst part is no one answers the call for more than 40 mins in 2 instances. I would rate less than single star for Air Arabia service. First impression with Air Arabia in overall dealing with customer is much below any acceptable quality standards.",,,,,
"  Air Arabia is the worst airline. They don't care for the passengers. Boarding is totally un-organised. I travelled on 16th Dec, due to delayed & worst boarding, flight was delayed by 45 mins. When it arrived, aero bridge was not used. Passengers were kept waiting in the bus for 30 mins as all three buses were made to go together. Passengers were jam packed in the buses. After completing the PCR test, immigration (which took 2 hours due to Sharjah's Airport's worst management), the baggage hasn't arrived. It tool another one hour, the baggage was removed from the belt and scattered around the hall. It was my worst travel experience. Will avoid travelling with Air Arabia to the max.",,,,,
"  The worst experience, I have traveled from Sharjah to Kyiv for big celebration the flight was delayed plus i was waiting for the luggage which they told us after one one didn’t come and will be tomorrow as of overweight, i had one kg extra which paid at the airport. When I asked if they will deliver luggage home they said i have to come to the airport again. Very bad experience.",,,,,
"  Horrible company. We had the worst experience ever traveling with this airline. They didn’t let us get in inside our flight even we are vaccinated and we have all our documents in law. They didn’t know the rules to get in at Egypt, even with the official website of the Egyptian government says clearly that people with the vaccine can go to Egypt for holiday. We were vaccinated in the United States but they didn’t understand that our vaccine is the same as in Europe and they didn’t let us to take the flight. Horrible attitude from the Italian supervisor and the guy from the counter. This supervisor didn’t speak a proper English and he didn’t help us in nothing. We showed up him the official information from the Egyptian government but he didn’t understand that he was totally wrong with his decision. I don’t recommend flying with Air Arabia airlines. They do the impossible for the customers don’t have a nice time flying with them and they don’t give you proper answers. It look like the people in the counter l don’t even know what they’re doing, besides a horrible attention. The supervisor was even worst. They are not prepared at all. My worst experience flying and I’ve been in more than 55 countries. I hope this situation helps to save you a lot of problems with this airline. ",,,,,
"  I am passenger of Muscat to Calicut on 19th September. I have lost my backpack luggage weighting 10kg. As per the request, It was handed over to airlines staff while boarding to flight in Muscat. As they informed i would get the baggage in luggage section. But unfortunately i didn't receive hand bag with my other luggage. There after reached at the destination i complained in the aiport (Air Arabia office). A week passed, no one turned to me with registered complaint. While i called customer care number they were unaware about luggage lost procedure. After connecting then 3 times they shared some contact numbers, which never answered and invalid. ",,,,,
"  I booked a flight with them from Doha to Baku for Sep 17, flight was supposed to leave 09:30 and arrive at Sharjah at 11:30am to connect for the flight to Baku at 13:00 and arrive there at 15:55. They sent me an email at 21:00 the night before( keep in mind my flight at this point is in less then 12 hours) saying that they have changed the flight and I should go online and either cancel or accept the new flight. Here is the catch. The new flight they purposed was leaving Doha on Sep 17 at 18:30 and arriving at Sharjah at 20:30 with a 4 day layover and not leaving for Baku until Sep 21. Naturally this is absolutely ridiculous and I cancelled the flight after which they refused to reimburse me. You see they put you in a situation that you can not accept the terms and at the end stiff you out of your money. ",,,,,
"  My flight was canceled and I don't need any credit voucher, I'd rather prefer the amount transferred to my bank account. But they say it's not possible. What am I supposed to do with the voucher if I don't need to travel with them in the next year?  It's even more unrespectful and ridiculous that they reply with a copy-paste of the previous email and don't have the time to answer their unsatisfied customer.  Really bad experience.",,,,,
"  I had booked with this airline in Feb 2020 before COVID19 hit the whole world. Australia had borders shut since March 2020 till now still closed with no opening date set. My ""fully flexible"" ticket that was paid at an extra cost, all meals and including luggage for 3 people, A$1,787.11 charged has now been taken from me from this airline with ZERO in return. Travel was booked for August 2020 and they refused a refund. They gave us a credit after countless emails with a expiry date that meant i could not book because we are still within travel restrictions, there is no reasoning with this airline. All i asked for was an extension of the expiry date to allow us to book once borders are open and they declined... over and over again i asked and escalated the matter to their complaints team and they all declined. All other flights were refunded for the family and friends we were traveling with but they booked with ryannair and Iberia and both airlines provided a refunded in full no questions or hassles.",,,,,
"  On our first flight from Brussels to Casablanca on Friday 27 November everything went excellent. We had registered our self for the flight and received the boarding cards and delivered our baggage at the airport. We have registered with our valid Moroccan passport and our valid resident cards; they were accepted without any issues at all. We did not get any further notification from the registering team that the same documentation will be refused during the back-flight... On 13 December we had our flight back from Casablanca to Brussels. We had the flight at 07.10 in the morning; we were at 03.30 in the morning in the airport. We have waited until the gates were opened to deliver our baggage and register for our boarding cards, however when we wanted to pass to the gates office to weight our baggage we were intercepted by two Air Arabia agents (one was the responsible of the flight that day and the other was controlling the documents). They refused to let us go to the gates office to deliver our baggage and they stated that our documents were not legal, the same documents that we have used to register in Brussels, our Moroccan valid passport and valid permanent residents cards. We have even double nationality, as we have the Moroccan and the Dutch nationality. When we tried to explain our case to the agents, they became aggressive and started to insult my wife in front of all passengers present in the hall. I went to the Air Arabia office in the floor below but the offices were closed. The agents kept on refusing letting us pass to get our boarding pass while we had a valid ticket and valid documentation, the same documentation that we have registered and used from Brussels to Casablanca. If the documentation was to be refused, then we should be notified in Brussels before even boarding to Casablanca... but that was not the case. The agents were executing police task by refusing us to board, I have registered a complaint at the police office in the airport and the police has confirmed to us that the agents do not have the legal rights to hold us from passing as our documents are valid. If someone should prevent us from passing that should be only the police that has right to. The agents were becoming more aggressive, the responsible as insulted my wife and shouted to her and after went away without giving any sign of presence, time went by and the gates have been closed and the time of flight has arrived (7.10), I could go through and escalate the problem and even prohibit the flight, but because my wife is a heart patient I didn’t want to escalate. My wife became unwell and had problems with breathing due to the stress caused by the agents, I have called for the airport doctor and we have waited for him in the cafeteria. When he came she was already better, he has examined her and confirmed she might flight back to Belgium. I have bought new tickets with Royal Air Maroc to Amsterdam as there were no tickets still to Belgium and we had to take the next flight and could not stay longer because I had to go to work next day. At the gates of the flight of Royal air Maroc, that was going to Brussels at the same time (12.30) I have presented the same documentation to the flight responsible and asked if the documents were OK to go to Brussels and she had confirmed it, when I said that the agents of Air Arabia have refused to let us pass she confirmed that it is ridiculous and there was no reason for that and that",,,,,

" I bought a ticket with Air Arabia in March for a vacation in Morocco. Because of COVID the flight got cancelled. I requested a cash refund but their call center charges crazy amounts. I sent numerous emails to their customer service only to receive standard reply messages. I did not give up and after some time their customer service center finally answered my messages only to let me know that Air Arabia's policy is not to offer a cash refund for COVID-cancelled flights. They said they only hand out a voucher that has to be used within 1 year. Since we couldn't go on vacation, this is completely of no use to me. Moreover, travel to Morocco is currently forbidden by Belgium. EU regulations clearly state that they are obliged to offer EU passengers the choice of a cash refund, but they seem not to care at all about passenger rights. This is the last time ever I travelled with Air Arabia, and I strongly advise anyone to not do business with this company.",,,,,
  No refund policy and call center 1€/minute even if line busy. My flight was canceled in March due to Covid-19 and they offer me a ticket valid one year that I cannot use because Morocco has been closed for the last 6 months and no sign of near reopening. I explained that I cannot use their ticket because we can't fly to Morocco and they keep sending the same email with the voucher valid one year (now 6 months) and if you call them you never get to speak to someone but I received a 30€ phone bill for the call. ,,,,,
"  Jouf to Nairobi via SharjahI booked the flight for my girlfriend, was cancelled by airline and 3 months later didn't get no response whatsoever.

"  My flight has been cancelled due to COVID-19 regulations. I insured the flight beforehand and asked for a refund. I received three blank, copy-pasted emails where it was clear nobody reads my requests, telling me I will get a travel voucher.

" I'm reviewing on behalf of my friend who I was with through all the stress and money lost by dealing with Air Arabia. In all my years in the travel business I am shocked at the unprofessionalism and sheer lack of empathy for passenger. Their condition of contract and other important information is non existent. My friends arrived through Milan to Cairo on 3rd July. It should have been from Naples but Air Arabia cancelled. Email arrived telling them their flight for their departure was cancelled out of Sharm El Sheikh on the 31st July. Air Arabia offered to go back on the 17th August. Nobody in Sharjah contacted them. My question was how were my friends to survive for 17 days. Another email canceling the flight on the 17th August. Rang Sharm airport who advised that there were no flights coming in from air arabia at all. So looks like they sold the seats knowing they wouldn't be flying in or out of Sharm. My friends had to buy 2 tickets with Egyptair yesterday to get to Cairo to catch a flight. They have to stay in a hotel for 2 nights in Cairo, I had to lend them 2000 egyptian pounds. Through all this their visas had run out and on arrival today in Cairo they were told they would have to pay for the visa being out of date. Air Arabia had the cheek to charge them for the seat increases on the two cancelled flights. This is not a covid problem, this is disgraceful. I live in Egypt and I know AA are based in Sharjah but their agents in Cairo couldn't care less. I'm disgusted at the behavior. ",,,,,
"  Had a ticket booked this summer of July 18th 2020. Used this airline for over 10 years only to find out that I dont have a choice but the travel to Morocco instead of postponing until next summer due to uncertainties in regards to corona virus restrictions in Morocco. Company made it clear it was all about their terms and condition and showed no compassion towards me or my family situation. Highly recommended to avoid this joke of a company due lack of understanding for their customers. Furthermore, I ultimately choose to stay behind to be safe than sorry. Paid over £1200 and thats now down the drain. In reality, they only care about the money at the end of the day. Will never use again!",,,,,
"  Marrakech to London. I was denied boarding (despite being at the checking counter with my family well before checkin closing) because of overbooking on the flight to Gatwick at Marrakech Airport on 23/2/2020. The Swissport staff were rude and extremely unhelpful and just informed that there are only 3 spaces on the flight for the 4 of us- we were made to run around without any solution provided. The gentleman at the ticketing counter asked us to talk to the supervisor - who we had to find by asking around 5 other agents - The supervisor offered to rebook us on a flight 3 days later, without any accommodation or compensation (for something that was clearly Air Arabia issue - overbooking) which was not acceptable to us. Finally I bought myself a ticket on another airline and came home while my family members went in the scheduled flight. No replies from customer care email for 8 days now. The checkin agents on the ground were extremely rude and focussed on shifting the blame on the passengers rather than finding a solution. Air Arabia business model seems to hinge on overbooking and leaving passengers without any recourse - their business model seems to be lying and cheating. I would give negative overall rating if I could.",,,,,

"  Delhi to Amman via Sharjah. The flight was delayed for three and a half hours and the employees knew and did not inform the travelers except at the gate, and they did not answer our inquiries, and when they started answering, one of the employees who offended his rude manner, his answers, and his reactions to the travelers responded, and whenever we asked him something necessary like your internet service to tell our people Or our work was refusing, and he says this why didn’t matter to me, then we asked for food, and he did not respond yet after 3 hours, and when I asked him about my next trip, how will it be programmed?

  Worst experience with an airline in my life! I had a trip booked for March. Cairo to Istanbul. They emailed me to tell me the flight had been cancelled. I emailed back to ask when I’d be refunded so I could book another flight. I got a response telling me my email had been blocked! I tried the main customer service site and no response to that either. I’ve never experienced this kind of  behaviour from an airline. Don’t use them!!!,,,,,
"  Fes to Marrakech. Booked 7 weeks before travel, travel time changed 3 times, last time by e-mail at 18.55 the night before travel. Air Arabia charged extra for luggage. Each time they sent through new flight details, and each time the 30Kg luggage I'd paid extra for in advance disappeared. The last flight time was too late for me to travel, so I took the early train. Air Arabia have refused to refund me, and refused to refund the extra baggage I paid for, even though the extra luggage didn't fly. I couldn't recommend Air Arabia to anyone.",,,,,
" Coimbatore to Sharjah and had to catch the next flight to Riyadh, when I reached the Air Arabia staff for enquiry to understand how should I reach my boarding Gate he asked me to wait through the security check in line to reach the Gate-20 and I did without waiting for a second, when I reached the Gate they told me that my flight departed and when I reached the transfer desk I was treated as if I had missed the flight intentionally. I never expected such irresponsible behavior from Air Arabia staff in a international airport. It’s a complete mismanagement and pushing the blame on the passenger to shift the ticket cost to the passenger where the issue is from Air Arabia staff. Even when I was ready to pay for the new ticket the staff gave me a false information that there was no ticket in the next available ticket, but when I approached SATA they gave me a ticket seamlessly for 900 AED. I was shocked by irresponsible behavior of staff. There were three staff in the transfer desk counter a female staff and two male staff who all were rude and were repeatedly blaming me for the delay rather understanding that I was made to wait in the que by the AirArabia staff.

"  Casablanca to Tunis. Bad service, overcharged 60 euros at the airport for no reason, staff would not let us board the plane until we pay the 60 euros which they poorly explained was because we were ""late"" even though 2 other groups of passengers were allowed to board while we were there. The plane was then delayed for over an hour. We paid for additional meals when booking, we never got those, and the cabin crew ignored our requests and our proof of order, we were then presented a menu telling us we have to pay again to get food. They ignored our official complaint on their website.",,,,,
"  I am writing this with complete dismay, disappointment, shock, helplessness, and utter anger. If you know what is good for you, avoid this airline at all costs. I have dreamed of a Morocco trip since 2005. This trip is a lifelong dream. I've booked multiple flights in and around Morocco for October to November. In a span of several weeks, almost each single flight has been moved and re-scheduled. The last straw was when I received an email today notifying a flight change that will mean losing 2 days in Morocco and completely ruining the entire itinerary and losing some paid transfers and tours in the process. I am in complete disbelief as I have been traveling for 28 years and have never encountered an airline so incompetent. They have removed every single way to reach them. All emails are automated, you cannot contact anyone through email, and the number they gave to call is also not in service. I feel so helpless and our trip has been single-handedly ruined by Air Arabia even before it began. I have lost all hope and excitement for this trip and even if I somehow manage to find a way to adjust our itinerary, it will still not recover a portion of the trip that has already been paid for. This company should be banned because all reviews here have a horror story of their own.",,,,,

Although only an hour-long flight we were given beef shawarma - extremely tasty. Would use them again.",,,,,
"  This was probably the worst experience I've had with an airline. In hindsight, I should have opted for a full service airline even at the premium cost. Our flight was on the 22nd of August, Sharjah to Kuala Lumpur. We paid for seats up-front (in row no. 4) hoping that we'd be able to travel with others who place a premium on their peace of mind and convenience. I could not have been more wrong about this. As soon as I sat in my seat, a raucous, rowdy group of customers walked in and sat right in front of us in Rows no. 2 and 3. At first, it just looked like a bunch of young people who were flying to KL for a good time and they'd settle in after a few hours of in-flight fun. Something told me that this trip was going to be problematic, but I just chalked that up to older me nerves. Drink service started. Our merry band selected a plane load of coffee and Red Bull for dinner to go with some sandwiches that AA provided. Being an overnight flight, once service was stopped, cabin crew switched off their lights. As they say, the party started after the lights went off. The group on the left put on their reading lamps which needless to say is quite jarring and did not aid in anyone falling asleep in a 2 m radius. The group on the right seemed sober and some of them curled up to sleep. The others were high on Coffee and Red Bull so they were fully charged up.  I went up to the cabin crew and requested them to ask this bunch to simmer down. It was about midnight UAE time and it is my belief that a paying customer is entitled to his sleep during the flight. To my surprise the cabin crew shrugged and said there was nothing they could do. Apparently, this was a group of 'bloggers' who were invited by Air Arabia to review the airline or its holiday package. The cabin crew supervisor went so far as to tell me to go complain if I wanted to and they couldn't care less. The shenanigans continued late into the night and at this time, my normally docile wife spoke up. We asked them respectfully to tone it down so that we could get some sleep before our onward flight to the next destination; to which we got a casual dismissal and was yelled back at. Cabin crew came to calm down the situation, which was the best they could do. After this incident, their belligerence was unfettered for the reminder of the flight. The laughing and the talking were louder and unbelievably uncivilized.  In effect, I paid additional to be harassed by a bunch of low-life thugs aided and abetted by the service provider. We were rendered powerless by an apathetic cabin crew and an airline that frankly does not give two hoots about the rights of its paying passengers. I have been flying Air Arabia since its inception, but I am completely done now. A loss of one customer means nothing to Air Arabia but it is my hope that reading reviews like this would give people an idea of the kind of people they give their money to.",,,,,

"  Gatwick to Fes. Beware of the hand baggage allowance! They charged me 50 euros for exceeding the maximum of 10kg just by 3 kg. and on the same time the flight was almost empty! I didnt have any other complaints but the whole thing with the hand luggage was really ridiculous! The worst part is when I refused to pay 50 euros, the staff tried to bargain so I could pay 35 euros! Totally unacceptable and unprofessional on the whole. They were actually blackmailing me, without giving me the ticket to board if I i didnt pay for the 50 euros charge. And that was just for 3 kg more! I think rules are rules but when you know that the flight is not really full and you dont exceed the allowance by 10-20 kg, I think it should be acceptable that 3kg wont hurt anyone. I would never recommend anyone book with this airline rather than picking up a more serious one and more professional. ",,,,,

  Marrakesh to Fez. The domestic check in was handled by Swissport and was efficient. The security screening took about 30 mins. The departures lounge was relatively compact and seating was limited. We were bussed out to the aircraft an A320. The flight took off about 10 mins behind schedule As it was overcast there was limited views of the Morroco on the 50 min journey to Fez. The crew were friendly & efficient and were quick to serve passengers that had pre-purchased food and beverages on the short flight. Air Arabia is a dry airline and no alcoholic beverages are sold on board. We arrived into Fez on schedule. Despite being a domestic flight were were required to pass through immigration who required both the boarding pass and passport. We waited for about 20 mins for our bags to be delivered.,,,,,
" Flew Air Arabia from Sharjah to Muscat (and back to Sharjah) as part of a visa run (UAE visa change). Really liked the cabin crew and on-board experience. Cabin crew were very well presented. A lot of the passengers were non-English speakers and I noticed the cabin crew were very polite and treated all of them with dignity and respect to help show them to their seats and put away their cabin bags. Plane was new, seats were clean and plane had a free-Wifi network streaming movie/TV programme (they called it SkyTime) which I used via my smartphone - it was fast. Bought snacks and coffee on board - nothing special but the service was very good. I am an experienced traveller and I really liked this airline and their onboard experience. I would fly with them again.",,,,,

"  We bought two tickets from Prague to Kathmandu via Sharjah in November 2018. We were supposed to leave April 13, 2019,  Ten days before the flight we tried to add some food and to change baggage allowance through internet browser. It must be said that their website does not work optimal in any of the internet browsers. We managed to change baggage allowance but no food. From that reason we log out and tried to add food later but we realized we don´t have access to our PNR anymore. We had still ten days to departure so we tried to contact their customer service via e-mail. Till now we do not have any answer. We contacted sales department in Prague by phone and also personally. They proved our PNR with conclusion we had cancelled both tickets in internet browser ourselves and the flight is full. We are still in shock. Two weeks of holiday, year of preparations for our big way to Himalayas, another friend waiting us in Kathmandu, services paid in Nepal are gone. Mainly, nobody let us know about tickets cancellation.  If I wasn´t interested about my PNR, I wouldn´t know yet my tickets are cancelled. As proof they just reproduced conclusion of their IT Department in Sharjah. You have no chance to get in touch with somebody from their central agency in Sharjah. Mainly I would like to point out that I do not get any document confirming ticket cancellation.  Welcome in modern times full of IT technologies where human being is a poor individual and those big fish use it for making money",,,,,

"  Gatwick to Fez. Flying to Fez, the flight was delayed by 3.5 hours and we were sat on the aircraft without a clue as to what the delay was caused by. The staff were disinterested in serving passengers and they would only accept euros or sterling to buy some of their overpriced food items. They forgot to take payment from me for a sandwich I bought and seemed disorganised. They told me that drinks were free on this flight. Flying back to Gatwick - the flight was delayed again by 40 minutes, again for a reason we weren't told. Staff again seemed disinterested. I tried to order a drink and was told to pay for it when on my previous flight with Air Arabia, the drink was free. So there's really no consistency in the customer service you receive.",,,,,
"  Amsterdam to Fez. Terrible company! Just like it happened to other people, we had an extra luggage but the people at the check-in desk could not see it on the system. We therefore had to pay an extra 50 euros fee on top of the luggage fee paid beforehand through the website. When asked, the lady at the check-in counter said that this happens frequently. So please do consider this if you want extra luggage. For the rest it is overall not better that other low-cost companies that are much cheaper. Would not fly with them again and would not recommend to other people, unless you enjoy being robbed.",,,,,

I didn't have any extra weight so I was ok but when I arrived to Alexandria airport, I waited in front of luggage claim conveyor for 90 minutes with 15 travellers but we all couldn't find our baggage. We went to Air Arabia representative and he said he received mail from Dammam and 32 luggages were removed from the plane as they were extra weight. I asked them to send my luggages to home but they refused. Then, I said  we will come to collect but you have to provide us with transportation but they said no. After that, I asked to reimburse me for what I paid but no use. I called customer service many times and every time they said we will talk to you later. I sent 3 different mails but there was no response. Again, I contacted them through their web page at facebook and asked someone to call me but they gave me more than 10 promises but no one called me. They have the worst customer service ever. Their employees are very rude and don't try to fix their mistakes or give a respect to their customers. Again, I have never seen such customer service all over the world.",,,,,
  Kuwait to Kathmandu via Sharjah. The staff in boarding pass counter were rude and didn’t issue my pass until it was 45 min for take off which mean I have to run. This much was fine but at the end of flight in Kathmandu when I collect my luggage i found it was damage and same time I fill up the form for the claim and after a week I got a reply saying I’ll be compensated half of the amount of the luggage. Then never hear from the baggage department. So all I can suggest is never use this airline. We pay for the flight which means we trust them for our bags and everything but all I can say is they doesn’t care. And I’m sure they really don’t care,,,,,
"  Gatwick to Marrakech. Our flight was affected by the disruptions in Gatwick airport caused by drones. Understandable that unpredictable situations occur, but the way the airline company treated us was awful leaving us waiting on the plane for 7 hours without any water. Later and in the absence of any information we received an email from the company asking us to phone them. More than an hour on the phone at a charge of more than £50 and noone picked up. On top of that despite the company's representative informing us that we could get refund for the cost of the flight if we didn't fly with them and chose other means, the company now refuses to do so.",,,,,

The plane was not clean and I flew in a early morning flight.",,,,,

But that's not the case anymore, they are now charging same like official airlines which are giving much more better service and even sometimes charging more. low cost flights are now the exception as offers given every now & then same like everyone else. - Ground team i encountered least to say were rude. you feel like treated as a low cost traveller while you are actually not. Head of ground team was treating people very bad when arranging the bus to air craft from Cairo airport - No in flight entertainment whatsoever - Leg room is extremely small and you're always touching adjacent travellers which is making flight completely uncomfortable - people are fighting each other all the time because of reclining seat back (due to small leg room) and arm rests without interference of flight attendants - charging for meals & soft drinks - charging for baggage - flight attendants are not so friendly - Air craft smell was horrible all the time Bottom line, either review your fares or upgrade your service Wouldn't recommend and most probably won't fly it again.",,,,,
  Baku to Sharjah. The first time flying Air Arabia. I travel so much but no any other airlines given such bad treatment. They give us separate seats to my and my husband both way coming and going. I am lady sitting separated from husband and some unknown men was sitting to near me for whole journey. T We ask them to give same sit at registration counters but the staff was so bad. They are not supporting at all. I never fly with Air Arabia any more in future.,,,,,
"  Marrakesh to London. I had read some pretty bad reviews about Air Arabia however, I was pleasantly surprised. The was an issue regarding checking in - we were unable to check in online but had no problem checking in at the airport. The flight was on time, the staff pleasant and we arrived 20 min ahead of schedule. The was plenty of leg room and I would fly again with Air Arabia.",,,,,
"  Ras Al Khaima to Lahore. I have been frequent flyer of Air Arabia. It used to be a good airline. With passage of time, it service has gone extremely poor. First time in my 25 years of traveling I was called back from immigration and my lap top weight was included in the hand carry. It exceed few kilo. I was forced to remove my laptop. I left my bag in the car and travelled. The duty manager did not listen to my request. In fact a smile on his face showed how much non professional people this airline hires. It was worst traveling experience of my life.",,,,,
"  Sharjah to Goa. This was one of the worst experience. Me my husband and my daughter were travelling from Sharjah to Goa in the month of June. They were supposed to check the baggage weight during the boarding process. No one asked us about the hand baggage weight. After the immigration was completed, the officer stopped us while going towards the gate and said they want to recheck our hand baggage. We had already weighed our luggage in the local  office in Abu Dhabi and they had informed us that the hand luggage is within the limit as they would not check the laptop bags. The ground officer checked our hand baggage, laptop bag, yy Purse and my daughter's laptop bag. He said we have 12 KGs excess bag. Straight away he took the boarding pass and gave to the other officer where there was already a big rush of passengers negotiating on money the officers were asking them to pay in cash, we were asked to pay AED 400.  I refused to pay anything for the 2 laptop bags and my vanity bag. They made me and my family stand there for about 1/2 an hour and finally, they negotiated to excuse us if we are paying 100 AED. The worst situation I would not want to travel through this airline again. They are only cheap in service and costly in price.",,,,,
  Brussels to Casablanca. I had to pay extra 50 euros at airport for having just 2 kilos more. I am very disappointed. My ticket cost me 200 euros at the start now cost me 250. Totally ridiculous At the end had to wait 1 hour at arrival the get back my luggage.,,,,,
" Air Arabia is a good airline. The airport staff are helpful and always smiling. The aeroplane was in a clean condition. The in-flight magazine is great and the duty-free and SkyMeal magazine had plenty of options and the food was OK. The in-flight entertainment is something Air Arabia must improve on. The pilots made PAs at regular intervals. The seat was comfortable and legroom was better than I had ever seen on a low-cost carrier. The overall experience was above average and according to the money paid, there were more than enough services.",,,,,
"  Bangalore to Moscow via Sharjah. The total fare was not at all low for the low coster + I had to pay extra for the luggage what is not mentioned while booking and I decided to pre-book my food on 2 international flights. In first place ground staff wanted to offer me middle seat, I had to pursue the ground staff for the seat. The crafts are  really dirty same as the Sharja airport where they land for transfer. Flight attendants are the least bothered about your needs, they just don't care. I requested flight attendants both flights to try change my uneatable meal for something else, but they refused.  Worst of the worst.",,,,,
"  Marrakesh to Paris. The only airline that allows no personal bag, and makes you check small baggage and then charge you 50 USD for the abuse. No leg room, knees get crushed if over 6ft (182cm) maybe not the worst 3.5 hours of my life, but top 10. I wish that they were in my home country so I could avoid purposely ever using them again, sadly they are not.",,,,,
"  Sharjah to Jaipur. Being Low cost airlines is fine, but how fair is it even ask a passenger to pay for extra weight bought at duty free, after immigration. Just before boarding. I have everything in place. Had a weight limit of 30kgs of check in. But had checkedin only 25 Kgs. Had another cabin luggage for 10kgs. Now after immigration I came to duty free. Made purchases within the applicable limits. And reached my boarding gate as I was getting late. Just before the gate. We were stopped and cabin baggage was rechecked. My duty free luggage was 6kgs & my hand luggage was within 10 Kgs. The gentleman at gate says, we will only allow 3kgs for duty free. No guidelines for this given before. We would have made purchases accordingly.  According to air Arabia 10kg + 3kg (duty free), that’s all what they will allow. I had to leave my luggage behind as they won’t agree or willing to listen what I’m trying to explain. Last minute changes. Hopeless low cost carrier.",,,,,
"  Manchester to Agadir. This is the best budget airline, 30 inch seat pitch, comfy seats. Excellent staff. Clean planes. Came on the company by chance. Baggage fees less than some budget airline.",,,,,
"  I had have one of the best experiences with Air Astana because my April trip from Dubai to Ust-Kamenogorsk via Almaty and Astana and back included 6 flights and all  were in time. Different types of aircrafts, such as B767 from DXB to ALA, Airbus 321 long range from ALA to NQZ Astana and Embraer E2 to UKK, all were clean and their condition was also good. Of course in this challenge A321Long range definitely wins because it was brand new. As for food everything was nice and wide choice of beverages is still available as before pandemic. And one more thing I took part in air Astana stop over holidays program for international travellers and my hosting in Almaty and Astana in hotels was very friendly. On international flights airline gives complimentary amenity kit even in economy class. I just have to mention that my screen of entertainment system on my way from Dubai to Almaty didn't work. That's why I took one point from my overall mark.",,,,,
 I fly this airline weekly for Almaty-Baku-Almaty and I have never ever had the flight on time. 40-60 minutes delay is routine for Air Astana. They have to reassess their attitude and schedule because those repetitive delays are not acceptable for what they call 4-star airline. The airline prices are not on level of service they provide either - Disappointing service to be honest.,,,,,
" This is really a different airline. The plane was impeccable, clean, looked young. Cabin staff is really amazing, taking care and checking during the hole flight. Food was exquisite. The Samsonite amenity kit was amazing, sleek and modern. A real pleasure to travel on this airline.",,,,,
"  I booked with Air Astana for a flight from Tashkent to Astana transiting in Almaty. Our flight was delayed for over an hour in Astana - an additional one hour later than my original booking. This meant that I now have too short a transit time and need to be re-scheduled. I received an SMS advising that I am rescheduled for a morning flight (arrival 10 a.m. the next day instead of 6 pm) I then went into frantic messages to my hotel in Astana cancelling my booking - about AUD100 extra for a few hours! On check-in I was moved to another later flight with no discussion with me. So I am unaware of this, land in Almaty transit and go to the counter to check my hotel voucher. There, I am directed to the amended boarding pass and it is for a night flight arriving 10pm. So, again, frantic messages to my hotel - after over 20 minutes running around to get a Kazakh SIM card - to re-book my room. I found the place now fully booked. Called them and thankfully, they re-booked my room. ",,,,,
"  The flight that I report was supposed to take place in March 2022, but it never took place. It was cancelled. However, a year after the flight, I haven't got any repayment although I've sent all the necessary documents to the company. All I got was promises. I did try to believe the company and even traveled with Air Astana once again in October 2022. Still, no keeping promises. ",,,,,
 What a nice little airline! Air Astana provides economy passengers with a surprisingly generous amenity bag which was a nice touch. Cutlery was real metal (rare in economy!) The food was really good and the staff were friendly. This is how an airline should be run! Well done guys.,,,,,
"  It was an amazing experience on all the 4 flights with Air Astana (IST-ALA-DEL and DEL-ALA-IST). Seats were very comfortable with enough leg space. Food was fresh, delicious and filling with lots of options (if you book pre-meal). Airline staff was exceptionally helpful and caring, they were just a bell away. Definitely value for the money.",,,,,
"  Everything was perfect, but not in Atyrau or in Almaty, no ground service available for business class. No lounge, no private vehicle or at least priority check in. There was a line in Atyrau in business class check in but only one agent was available and service was not welcoming at all. I suggest to provide an access to VIP lounge if you don’t have own lounges in Atyrau and Almaty airports, and add it to the ticket price. In flight service was exceptional. ",,,,,
"  My flight from Aktobe to Almaty was canceled. I had another flight to Phuket and then from Phuket to Sydney by another airline. Air Astana didn’t provide any option to get to Almaty, they only offered to return money or re-book to 3 weeks later. Call center couldn’t help. I bought by my own ticket to Almaty through Nur-Sultan and requested refund for this segment and compensation of my expenses for ticket I purchased by myself. I haven’t received yet any answer from them from July, 5, 2022.",,,,,
"  I experienced exceptional customer service from the ground staff who checked in our baggage was professional and exceptional customer orientated. Not only she helped with our special request (which she could easily deny as per rules and which required an extra effort from her side) moreover, she went beyond that. She send an email to the Air Astana representative in Georgia asking for assistance, which we never asked for.  She even accepted a slight extra bag weight and wished us a pleasant flight. Airbus 320 Neo - nice aircraft with comfy chairs. Good selection of movies, would be cool to have some podcasts though! Overall flight was good, rest of the staff did well also.",,,,,
" Thoroughly enjoyed flight from Nur Sultan (Astana) to Frankfurt with Air Astana Sunday 14th Feb 2021, I was travelling from Almaty to Frankfurt via Astana. First leg economy, second leg business. The service on both flights was very good and the food and drink outstanding. Tasty sandwich on the first domestic leg and given plenty of choice and excellent presentation of starter and main course on the international flight. Good Job Air Astana.",,,,,
" I have been using Air Astana on various domestic and international routes for 15 years. I have seen great improvements in this time from the early days. Not only in the quality of the aircraft and facilities but especially in in the cabin services. My recent flight this month highlighted this. Though I travelled economy I found the cabin staff very attentive and helpful. They were polite and supportive and prompt with any requests. The food was excellent, it was breakfast but hot, tasty and filling. The amenities packs are now eco friendly. They contain all those items that one requires on a journey of 3 hours or longer. They look good too. It was a new aircraft that was very clean, with comfy seats and was equipped with an excellent entertainment package. My only concern was travelling during these difficult times and the flight was full, understandably with the reduce number of flights scheduled. The in cabin safety brief, which is excellent and worth watching in all three languages, has had an amendment to relate to the latest pandemic requirements. The cabin crew enforced these rules without fear or favour in a very polite and professional manner. Keep up the good work Air Astana, you are my favourite airline.",,,,,
"  Poor service with customers. I booked 2 tickets in February and March. The company canceled the flights and sent emails automatically. No clear information or explanation. I tried many times to contact the call-center of the air company to get more information about the flight and discuss the schedule, but no answer. I sent an email immediately but replied after 2 months without detailed information. I have been waiting for a refund for 3 months. This is my first time to face such as poor service and no respect for customers.",,,,,
" Almaty - Saint-Petersburg is my favourite route. Flight was on time. Aircraft was brand new A320NEO (2 months old). Service was excellent, food was very good, choice of beverages perfect. Now airline using eco packs for amenity kits and it looks so good! And also inside of the kit they even put neck pillow, because flight was longer than 5 hours.",,,,,
"  London Heathrow - Nur Sultan - Almaty in December 2019, returning 8 days later. Check in at LHR was efficient and fast track through security excellent. However the flight was then delayed at the last minute and there was hardly any seating at the gate where we had to wait, no announcements/updates and few staff who seemed a little disorganised and unhelpful. Several passengers including myself had connecting flights which was making people quite agitated as they were unsure what would happen if they missed their connections. Once aboard, the cabin layout and space were excellent. Staff were efficient, polite and you were made to feel very welcome. The food choices were great, very tasty and portion sizes just right. There was a huge choice of drink options too. The seat converted easily to a very low level lay flat bed and I managed to sleep for a few hours. Upon arrival in Nur Sultan I was met off the flight (pre-arranged) and taken through security with a quick stop in the lounge to freshen up before joining my connecting flight on to Almaty. The lady who met me was excellent and couldn’t have been more helpful. It was a huge help to me as I was travelling alone and there was very limited time to pass from international to domestic and then find my onward flight to Almaty. She spoke perfect English and made the transfer very smooth for me. The flight to ALA was good. Plenty of leg room and great adjustments on the seat, especially for leg support, but perhaps more tricky to climb out of from a window seat than the previous flight layout. The breakfast menu was excellent as you could choose anything from a pastry and coffee right up to a full cooked breakfast. The cabin crew served this efficiently in a limited time frame. My return journey was equally enjoyable. On the Nur Sultan to LHR leg there were about 40% seats not occupied in business class which made the experience even more special as the staff had more time to ensure you were comfortable. It was nice to be able to enjoy this leg during daylight hours as I’d slept a chunk of the outward version of this leg! All in all I really enjoyed my first experience with Air Astana. The only disappointment was the initial delays at Heathrow, the area we had to wait and how these were handled by the ground staff there.",,,,,
"  I want to say thank you to the Nomad Club team. Recently I had a trip from Almaty to Dubai, this trip was quite difficult, we went through all sorts of delays to weather and other reasons, flight changes, etc. Once this trip was over I described everything to Air Astana Customer care, and I was very satisfied with their response and actions. ",,,,,
"  Almaty to Bishkek. Have flown this route number of times in past year sometimes via TSE, the older version of Embraer used which in my view is more comfortable than the new model in their fleet. All Sectors on schedule, very pleasant crew.",,,,,
"  Atyrau to Almaty. Cabin crew was inattentive and rude. Twice requested for a blanket, didn’t get it till the end. That time I thought maybe it’s not included for economy seats. But last time had to take business class ticket, yet no blanket was given and service was still not the welcoming. Aircraft was clean and comfortable. Food quality was satisfying. Also my friend’s luggage was lost on his flight. Asked me to help him to negotiate with lost and found team since he doesn’t speak Russian. The operator was non-helping. When i asked her the approximate time his luggage will be delivered she told me that it will be there after one hour. We waited 3 hours at hotel lobby at night, and didn’t get it. The lost and found was already out of service. I guess company like this can afford to make the lost and found service 24/7. So the luggage was delivered only at noon, even though airplane that brought it from Amsterdam arrived at night. ",,,,,
  London to Nur-Sultan in August 2019. Awful experience. They used to be good but not anymore. I often fly from London to Almaty using Air Astana. The check in company ASC at Heathrow Terminal 4 used by Air Astana are rude and not friendly at all. ,,,,,
"  Tashkent to London via Almaty / Astana.  Air Astana customer service is horrendous, especially if you’re stranded at an airport trying to get home. On my 7-hour flight, there was no inflight entertainment or USB charging points. I’m on the verge of tears midway through a journey from Tashkent to London via Almaty and Astana. My flight from Astana to London has been delayed, which happens. It’s not the first time and won’t be the last. Air Astana’s handling of the delay has bee utterly abysmal and frankly negligent. I was at the airport 1.5 hours before my flight was due to leave as I was transferring from Almaty. I had no notification or text message, I just found out when I wanted to make my way to the gate! I tried to find some staff, no one was around to ask questions. I went to the business lounge, who rang someone and said “they’re coming”. A whole 40 mins later, no one came. I went to one of the gates to ask staff there. They asked if I was on the Dubai flight. When I said no, they walked off. At this point I didn’t know whether my flight was cancelled, delayed or what time it was due to London. I eventually found a desk in the corner of the terminal and they advised me to go upstairs to get some food and water. They had no vegetarian options at all and tiny cups of water. I’ve been travelling for 20 hours at this point and still don’t know when I’m going to get home ... but at least I have a drop of water to keep me going.. Do yourself a favour and book any other airline.",,,,,
"  Novosibirsk to Almaty via Nur Sultan. Check in was easy and straight forward. There were no problems with being 1kg overweight. Both flights left and landed on time. Cabin crew were polite and spoke good English and managed to serve a snack on each flight, despite them being short flights. Seats were comfortable. I had paid extra for the Nur Sultan - Almaty leg and quite spacious.",,,,,
"  Kuala Lumpur to Almaty. I credit Air Astana for their superior service on a recent flight from KUL to ALA last Tuesday 1st October. The service received on the flight was second to none, where the team leader provided a first class service during the the 7 hour flight. The quality of the main meal, wine and snack was excellent. I know Air Astana has received some criticism in the past but it was one of the best experiences I have had when flying. They made you feel welcome and special from start to finish.",,,,,
"  Beijing to Almaty. Airline billed me R1800 for my hand luggage bag, while was within its weight limit. According to their statement hand luggage and a laptop bag is 2 items, hence the reason I needed to check in my hand luggage, knowing only on bag is allowed. They than ask me to pay via my debit card. We were a team and I was asked to pay, my team was allowed to take hand luggage and a laptop bag. I demand my money to be refunded.",,,,,
"  Moscow to Shymkent via Almaty. For foreign passengers buying Air Astana's tickets through travel websites such as Expedia or Priceline, beware of tactics in getting people to buy their low priced tickets, only to find out the 'Economy Class with one piece of checked luggage included' actually means only 1 kg of checked luggage, which is less than the weight of most suitcases! On their website, the baggage policy for Economy class is stated as 20 kilos, with no mention of a 1 kilo policy. We flew from Moscow to Shymkent and even though our confirmation page clearly stated we are economy passengers with 1 piece of luggage included, we were forced to pay for excess luggage because their system showed we are not allowed checked luggage. We complained to the supervisor in charge of Air Astana check in desk at Moscow SVO airport but she was rude and unhelpful. She was basically saying 'I don't care what your Confirmation Page says. We go by our system so either pay or don't fly!' We have since complained to Air Astana and asked for a refund, but no reply yet. Beware!",,,,,
"  Kuala Lumpur to Almaty. I would like to express my deep gratitude to the crew of KC936 at the 25th August for their good work in conditions of prolonged turbulence. The stewardesses, in spite of the shaking, carried out the service, organize food and drinks. The food was excellent. Service was on top! Thanks to the pilots and the entire crew for the excellent flight.",,,,,
" Astana to Delhi via Almaty with Air Astana. Horrible experience, airlines delayed the flight but gave no updates or indications when the flight would go. They changed the pre blocked seats, shifted me from aisle to window, this is despite having a boarding card for aisle seat. When I complained to cabin crew, they were arrogant and told me you did not pay to block so we can move you if we want. They were not at all apologetic for the delay, on top of that they did not serve a proper meal saying that I had not made a special request, which is strange as I had not made a special request while coming into to Almaty as well, but the they served the meal. The passenger in the seat in front also had an issue and the stewardess was like you can write if you want it doesn’t matter.",,,,,
"  Our flight from Baku to Nur-Sultan was supposed to depart at 11.50pm on 23 June 2019. However, due to mechanical problems, the flight got cancelled and we were rebooked on the flight at 11.50pm on 24 June 2019. Therefore, we were delayed to depart Baku for 24 full hours. The Air Astana ground staff in Baku Airport made absolutely no formal announcement in English about the process. So we did not know what to do and what to expect. Many passengers just formed a circle around the ground staff and it was a total chaos. The whole process took almost 5 hours from flight cancellation until we got our bags and left the airport. All passengers were very exhausted and we were not provided any food or drink during that time. We were provided food or drink for the first time around 6 hours after flight cancellation. It seems to me that Air Astana could not professionally handle flight delay/cancellation situations. I also requested Air Astana to provide us delay compensation according to the ""Air Astana Rules on Long Delay Cancellation and Denied Boarding"" policies on 28 June 2019. I have not heard from Air Astana since then.",,,,,
"  Almaty to Moscow. Every time I used Air Astana I was always satisfied by the service provided and attention to every detail. Aircrafts are ideally clean, quality of food is good, personnel are professional and attentive. But this flight positively surprised me. New aircraft, updated stylish kits for passengers and especially children, comfortable chairs. I felt myself, like I was in business class! In general, compared with other airlines, Air Astana differs by its client orientation in every element of service: dessert choice, music, responding to requests, desire to do all that is possible to solve client issues, cleanness inside aircrafts - which is very important (blankets, toilets, etc). ",,,,,
" Almaty to Dushanbe with Air Astana. Forced me off my flight during check in (plane was not cancelled, it was overbooked) even though I booked 3 months in advance. Staff said this happens everyday and could provide no help. They suggested I contact their office who has not responded to my questions. Staff even asked me to please complain because this happens so often and they are clearly sick of it. To avoid this problem for others, I would recommend not using this airline as they were extremely unprofessional and no one could answer my questions. I travel every month to many countries across Asia and have never been treated so poorly. Later, Air Astana replied to my compliant with A) Wrong flight/date, and B) blamed it on a travel agent (I didn't use a travel agent) and C) stated an email notification was sent when it was not. The fact that they will lie to invalidate my legitimate complaints shows the type of business they do.",,,,,
" I have never been so positively shocked by any other airline in my life! I've heard nothing but good things about Air Astana, but my experience even exceeded those high expectations. On the 2hr45m trip from Baku to Almaty, there was a full amenity kit provided (that which rivals those on transatlantic routes) ear plugs, pen, toothbrush and toothpaste, lotion, comb, eye mask, and socks! Small candies were provided before takeoff on both flights. The meal provided from Baku to Almaty was average (it's always a risk coming from a city which isn't a hub.) On the Almaty-Bishkek leg, water was provided before takeoff, as it's a less than 1 hour-long flight. The cabin crew were so pleasant and well spoken in Kazakh, Russian, and English, and the pilots gave beautifully detailed and eloquent messages in all three languages as well. Seats were average, but I didn't mind with all of the other services provided. Important - Row 14 on the 757-200 aircraft has no window, so please take caution when reserving seats. All in all, I would go out of my way to fly Air Astana again!",,,,,
  Nur Sultan to Shymkent. Extremely nice experience. Food and drinks served on short flight all included in the ticket price. Cabin crew very friendly and professional.,,,,,
"  Almaty to Istanbul. Please review your Cabin crew training program. KC 911 on 17/06 delayed for 30 mins. Actually there were at least 3 flights, which were delayed around of this time. Ground staff of Air Astana did excellent work. Even though it was crowded, they handle situation professionally. 5 star to Ground staff. (Except of one thing. Lady on the check-in counter told me, that there is no delay of the flight, when actually it was a delay for 30 mins. I mean, not a big deal and most probably delay wasn't announced to staff at that moment. But fact is fact, I would rather spend 30 mins with my beloved ones, instead of crowded ""transit"" area (if you can call Almaty airport hall a transit area)). Real bad experience starting with announcement of the flight. Not sure, whose fault it is, airport or airline, but should be sorted. You can not hear, what staff announced, it is simply hard to understand about which flight she was talking about. Sound had a really bad quality. Waiting area was crowded and too loud. Almaty airport is very old and small. It should be replaced a long time ago. The reason, why I'm leaving this comment are cabin crew. Seriously guys, you need to review your politics and training program. As a constant customer, you can see how quality is going down. If Supervisors and business class crew are still on track, your junior/economy staff is losing a mark. Crew was rude. They commanded to do procedures, before take off and when customers (who may never flew before) looked for explanation, the answers were very sharp and again rude.  Crew responded with single words, time to time mixing it with Russian, and it was obvious that it was hard for them to express themselves in single sentence.  They gave an option of two meals, as usual chicken and beef. However during serving, crew literally served us without asking anything. When someone noticed, that they would prefer beef, crew responded, that she would prefer beef as well, but what is left is left. Same crew complained, that she has to wait for customers when all of them visit restroom, and because of what she is not able to serve the rest, who were keep calling her.",,,,,
"  Nur Sultan to Frankfurt. In every sense a 4 Star experience. As a frequent traveller it was my first 4 flights from FRA to ALA via TSE and back and I was impressed. An excellent product with attention to detail. The presentation and quality of the inflight catering in my opinion is slightly above a 4 star carrier. Great airline,great product.",,,,,
"  Seoul to Istanbul via Almaty. I was uneasy throughout the flight. Passengers have been on board for over an hour and have not left. In the meantime, the announcement came 40 minutes later. The children's food came out as baby food. I asked stewardess the adult meals because child could not eat, but she declined firmly.",,,,,
"  St-Petersburg to Istanbul via Almaty.  A21 neo for both ways with Recaro seats,comfortable for 5-6 hours flight. Food was perfect, especially from Istanbul. Good choice of beverages.  On the way to Istanbul I over slept my dinner, but I got it after and the coffee was hot. In Istanbul new airport I had to visit Air Astana kiosk and I got  qualified assistance there! Other flights Saint-Petersburg to Almaty, from Almaty to Astana and back to Saint-Petersburg were very good.",,,,,
"  My flight from Tbilisi to Bangkok via Almaty on 15-16APR. I wasn't sure what’s wrong with inflight service for sector ALA to BKK. My friend and I have asked crew for blanket as it’s very cool and we were unable to adjust the temperature due to the type the aircraft which didn’t have the option on the compartment. She was providing blanket to passengers and when she reached my row/seat, she said that “Women/Children first” Her tone/sound eye contact was very rude. Is this policy to provide blanket to women and children first? I don’t mind if I get after, but I didn’t get it. I doubt that Women/children paid more expensive ticket? However, I also paid for the ticket. I was’t taking free flight. We were waiting until she provided blanket to all women and children. However, she has never come back with blanket to us. My woman friend sit behind has offered her blanket to me as I was so cool and freezing.  Have sent this comment to the airline and they apologized but not response or clarify from what I doubt/questions. In addition, drink has’t served even water in the morning before landing at Bangkok. I asked for water, but the crew said I am busy with collecting blanket and never come back to us. ",,,,,
  Excellent economy flight with Air Astana. This was an afternoon flight and they provide an amenity cit for all passengers and a blanket. Cabin crew friendly and hospitable. Several times they go around with drinks and the food was really delicious. A perfect Economy flight.,,,,,
"  Almaty to Istanbul. I use Air Astana for my domestic and international flights, I can say that they are best option for the region. The quality of service, aircraft quality keeps increasing.",,,,,
"  Dubai to Almaty. Overall impression is great. Flight attendants very attentive and nice - food is good. Entertainment, since I am traveling often, variety is limited for me. Renewed in two months, not enough. Some some standard business class seats, but I would prefer to Beijing a bed seat, it is night flight.",,,,,
"  Almaty to Astana on an early morning flight in economy class. I was impressed by this aircraft which still feels very new inside. Inflight entertainment is available at each seat (with a USB port) and there is a good selection of programs. The flight attendants were nice and professional, good info from the pilots and we arrived to Astana with no delay. Overall a very nice experience.",,,,,
"  Almaty to Astana. Consistency of ground service, food, cabin service and inflight entertainment are core values of this airline. Sometimes I push myself to have connecting flights to the destinations where they have no direct flights.",,,,,
" The shared Lounge Facility at Heathrow was very good. The ground crew and cabin crew were all very friendly as my wife was travelling with a very painful condition. The Business Class seats offer a great deal of room and can be arranged to lie flat, but are a bit hard, the food was good. The cabin crew arranged for a wheelchair and assistance at Astana, which was there on arrival. We unfortunately had to cancel our onward flights to Bangkok as my wife's condition took an unexpected turn for the worse. We had a nightmare in trying to confirm cancellations and working out the refund due. Customer service had not replied to an email after 10 days. However, it is not that mistakes happen that is a detriment to airlines, it is how they are handled by senior management. I wrote to the CEO vie email and got a very prompt response, with a 2 page letter explaining some of the background, but more importantly what would be done to avoid a repeat should this happen to someone else.",,,,,
" This journey was 6 legs long with Air Astana. Saint-Petersburg to Almaty, from Almaty to Ust'-Kamenogorsk and back, Almaty to Aktobe and back, and finally from Almaty to Saint-Petersburg. If my trip from LED to ALA is usual thing almost two times a year, but my new discovery was domestic flight KC863/864 from Almaty to Aktobe. Oh my god, even choice of hot meal dish. Other stuff just have to mention : clean cabin, perfect meal each way. I also had my air astana's mug I got last year. It's capacity is about 400 ml and asked to fill it up with coffee: ""no problem, sure!“ I heard the answer! My flight from Ust'-Kamenogorsk was delayed, but I got notification by e-mail 4 hours before departure, so I was still at home. 6 flights and only one delay. I think it's good factor. overall: everywhere I saw attentive staff, helpful managers and perfect service.",,,,,
  Amsterdam to Atyrau. I am a regular user of Air Astana for work purposes and have been for over a year now. I had never heard of Air Astana before so I was very skeptical to say the least. What a mistake that was. I would put Air Astana right along big international carriers. The on board service and food are excellent the flights are on time. The cabin crew are very professional and language skills are excellent. ,,,,,
"  Tashkent to Hong Kong via Astana/Almaty. Arrived early at Tashkent airport just to be told that Astana Air does not offer a lounge at that airport anymore. Boarding was chaotic, as they annouced boarding, traveling business class I rushed to the gate, only to be told to wait 10 minutes. Then, they started boarding the around 100 economy class passengers as I waited standing by the counter. After around 15 minutes, I was invited to board, very weird process. Once onboard, I was greeted by 2 friendly flight attendants, who showed my seat and offered an welcome drink. Cabin was beautiful with mood lighting and well apointed, very comfortable seat for 2 hours flight. After take off, they offered more drinks with warm nuts, plus took dinner orders. Food was delicious, well prepared and of high quality. Next flight from Astana to Almaty, they offered a good lounge in Astana, with some basic snacks. They had a special boarding line for business, boarding was very efficient and fast. 767 cabin is really beautiful, well appointed and comfortable even for longer flights. Welcome champagne offered and menus distributed. Food, once again, excellent and high quality, as well as drinks options. From Almaty to Hong Kong, the longest portion, I was invited to the lounge, but as I entered it, I was advised that Air Astana passengers cannot use the buffet facility or bar, and must pay for any drink consumption of drinks, even water. Noticed passengers from other airlines using the same lounge to have access to a full buffet and drinks choice, so very poor experience for Air Astana premium customers. Anyway, they also offered a separate line for business class and boarding was fast and efficient. Once again a 767 with beautiful cabin and very comfortable flat seats. Also this time, crew was courteous and friendly and dinner was of high quality, as well as drinks. They also offered a very nice ammenities kit and noise-reducing headsets, but wifi was not working on this flight. All in all, in those 3 flights, I received excellent service from professional and courteous flight attendants plus high quality ammenities and food / drink choices. Only aspect to be improved are the lounges experience, especially for international flights. But all flighst were ontime, with excellent crew and modern and well appointed planes/cabins, so I am looking forward to fly on Air Astana business class again in the future.",,,,,
"  Saint-Petersburg to Astana, Astana to Almaty and from Almaty to Tbilisi. Food just perfect, chicken with baked potatoes, next flight potato dumplings with bacon, and the last one beef with pasta. Good amenity kit on international flights in economy class - useful brush, tooth paste, socks. First flight was on A320 with no personal screens, but I used KC TV app. Next flight about 1 hour and it was B757 with personal entertainment, and the last one was Embraer 190 also I was using KC TV. Cabin crew on the flight from Almaty to Tbilisi was unbelievable attentive.  All flights on time, clean cabins.",,,,,
"  Frankfurt to Bangkok via Astana / Almaty. Air Astana was way more than I expected. Check in was super easy and the cabin service is great. The food, drinks and entertainment make long flights easier. They took amazing care of me when flights changed but I had an important appointment and they moved things around for me to get me back in time. They also put me up in a great hotel where I was also able to go explore Kazahkstan for a day! I will definitely be looking for flights with them again. ",,,,,
"  I'm replying back on Air Astana's response which been posted on 18th September 2018 : Air Astana's response: Let us highlight that the transfer counter in Beijing is not just an Air Astana or Cathay Dragon transfer counter. It is a general airport transfer counter for all airlines, and all transfer passengers wait there for the counter to be opened at 6am. Based on the report from our colleagues in Beijing, on arrival you were met by our staff, who checked your baggage tag and passport. After the transfer counter opened, you were provided with boarding pass on time and continued with your flight to Hong Kong. I asked so many times Air Astana representatives to recheck exactly this details about operation hours of transit counter in Beijing, they weren't able to give me an answer. Based on the report - ""your colleague in Beijing met me and provided the boarding pass""?! Nobody met me at the transfer zone, the lady from the immigration desk saw i was crying and offered me the help, she wrote on a piece of paper details of my flight based on my ticket on my phone, the boarding pass i got only at the gate, couple minutes before it closed! My baggage was founded by Cathay Dragon - yes, but when at the same day i called Air Astana representatives before my baggage been found and asked to check regarding my missing baggage, i got an answer over email only after 1 week. I have been a loyal customer of Air Astana over 11 years and instead of apologies, Air Astana representative try to look this case that it's my fault - its fault of Air Astana representatives. You cannot sell on your official website the tickets which have only 1H transit time, i believe you should recheck transit desks operating hours before you sell those connection flight or at least notify your clients about potential risk of missing the connecting flight, as flight arrive at 5AM transit desk open at 6AM next flight at 7AM. 2. I believe Air Astana representatives should have better knowledge about those details and when clients ask about transfer activities in the airport where will be connection flight, your rep. should be able to provide this info. I will not even bother to write all this post but its very affair that after 11 years using your airline I have been treated like this!",,,,,
"  Delhi to Almaty. The aircraft was new and clean. Business Class passengers were greeted and escorted. The staff were attentive and courteous. Food on board was as good as airline food can be. We were a group of over hundred passengers that flew in over 3 days for a celebration and in spite of a some celebratory behavior, the crew were friendly and tolerant. One of the return flights had some technical issue and the aircraft had to be changed. We are looking forward to travel back again.",,,,,
"  Delhi to Almaty. Great airline and service, no complaints. The staff was courteous and helpful. New planes, overall a solid experience, highly recommended.",,,,,
"  Delhi to Moscow via Astana. The Check-in staff at Delhi airport were more suspicious towards Indian passengers. The staff was asking more questions than the immigration officers. The ground staff was managed by Air India. And the staff of the Air India is the worst, they were very rude and behaved unprofessionally. The in-flight entertainment looked like it was from the 90's. There was no personal inflight entertainment system on board. The plane looked the older fleet. Cabin Crew was quite friendly. But the food was the typical. I expected Kazakhstan cuisine on board. Beef was not served on Board. And now the Transit part. Astana airport was of good size and very well maintained. But the problem is that the airport doesn't provide drinking water to the departure and transfer passengers and people have no choice but to buy drinking water (1 euro for 500 ml). Wifi was not working, the login wasn't opening (neither in my laptop nor in my mobile phone). Astana to Moscow no complaints for this flight because everything was perfect. From food to the in-flight entertainment system. Returning, Moscow Sheremetyevo to Almaty in-flight service by the cabin crew was very good. Problem was that there was no personal inflight entertainment system. The Check-in staff at the Moscow Sheremetyevo was quite friendly and helpful. Almaty to Delhi flight was late due to transfer passengers. But it was not a problem because the duration was not much. The problem The cabin crew looked exhausted for no reason. The food served on the flight was only a light breakfast (omelette and a small piece of potato cutlet) which is not sufficient for a 2 hour+ flight. A complete meal should have been served. There was personal no in-flight entertainment system. Only a screen on top at a distant which was playing a movie in Russian/Kazakh. Almaty airport was quite Small but well maintained. The airport looked crowded because of the huge amount of passengers. And also no potable water for passengers. Only payable bottled water. ",,,,,
"  Flew Delhi to Almaty with Air Astana. Excellent service, the aircraft was well maintained and they exceed our expectations on ground too. Even though we had a technical glitch with the aircraft they were super fast to resolve it.",,,,,
  Hong Kong to Tbilisi via Almaty. A horrible and awful experience I ever met. Unprofessional ground crew and poor arrangement of delayed flight. I wont take Air Astana again and wont recommend.,,,,,
  Delhi to Almaty return. Our group was more than 20 passengers travelling to Almaty from Delhi on 10th Sept. We were very impressed with the in-flight service and the personal touch. One of the air hostesses also welcomed us both in Hindi and English. Our group’s return journey was on 17th September from Almaty to Delhi which was again very comfortable and the service was extremely good. ,,,,,
"  Bishkek to Kuala Lumpur via Almaty. Worst flight experience in 30 years! The flight was grounded unannounced by the pilot after a minor medical emergency of an elderly lady who had become unconscious in economy class and all +200 passengers were forced to evacuate at Turkmenistan airport and were left there for 15 hours with no water, no food and zero care, whilst the crew was relaxing and recovering in their hotel. The flight resumed after 15 hours with the same crew, whom I perceived as careless and unprofessional.  For one unconscious lady passenger, more than 200 were left stranded. Needles to say we lost our connection flights (different airline) in Kuala Lumpur and were forced to pay. This was the first and last time I took Air Astana and so will be my associated, family and friends.",,,,,
  Almaty to Kuala Lumpur. My family and I travel with Air Astana and are accustomed to a high level of service provided by the airline. During a flight last week from Almaty to Kuala Lumpur I witnessed a crew have to respond to an emergency medical situation about an hour into the flight. The professionalism of the Captain and Crew in handling the situation resulted in saving the life of a passenger. Medical emergencies can happen to anyone and at any time. Having experienced the crew's actions first hand I am confident that my family and I are in safe hands with Air Astana.,,,,,
"  Terrible experience and terrible service. Its overpriced flights, for a direct 6H flight from Hong Kong to Almaty i paid 1700USD! For this price during the flight we didnt have TV, worked only 1 toilet, can you imagine the toilet condition, it was disgusting! Food was terrible and stewardess completely ignored when i asked for water at list 5 times. I was flying back from Almaty to Hong Kong with the stop at Beijing. When I was doing check-in at Almaty airport at Air Astana counter, as i have Nomad Club and its automatically set request window seat when i buy an online ticket, a representative from Air Astana said, they don't know why it doesn't work and they don't have time to check what is the problem. They gave me only one boarding pass, however, did check in to my baggage directly to HK. Air Astana representative said i don't need a China visa as only 2H transit and boarding pass they will give me at Beijing transit, as it was 5 AM flight transit counter was closed. i couldn't go through immigration as I don't have Chinese visa. I almost missed my flight, luckily because i been crying for 2H at immigration desk, the lady at immigration helped me and wrote on a piece of paper my boarding pass, to let me go through immigration so i can go to different Terminal where was my flight to HK. I arrived to HK my baggage was lost! I emailed and called to Air Astana the same date when I arrived in HKG, they promised to find my baggage as soon as possible and study my case with their terrible service, it was one week since Air Astana baggage department finally contacted me. Plus my suitcases arrived broken!",,,,,
"  Almaty to Seoul. The flight was delayed because of technical issues and this affected our travel plans, which ended up emptying our pockets because we had rearrange our following flights that were following. We wrote a letter to Air Astana 6-7 times requiring the compensation. We sent the invoice of our expenses, that we received from Vietnam representatives as a check of payment. Air Astana told us that invoice is not a valid document for compensation. We talked to Vietnam partner again, and received a letter from them stating that invoice document they gave us earlier serves as a check of payment in Vietnam and they can only provide the invoice document in their country. We forward this letter to AirAstana and never got response. Terrible client relationship. For two months I can not get my money back, not talking about the time value of money. ",,,,,
"  Moscow to Delhi via Almaty. Moscow to Almaty on a new Boeing 767, with personal entertainment screens and mood lighting. Staff accommodating and professional. The meal was delicious with metal cutlery. Wine and beer were complimentary (no spirits on the menu, though), and extras were served with no frowns. IFE was one of the best I experienced, no lag whatsoever. One weird thing was that the screen by design could not be adjusted when the seat in front was reclined, so the viewing angles could be uncomfortable. We were given outstanding amenity kits with neck air pillow, slippers, pen, some hand cream, eye shades and ear plugs. Different coloured kits seemed to have slightly different content, so make sure to collect them all. The crew passed the cabin with drinks several times after the meal service. Seat comfort was okay, nothing outstanding. Almaty to Delhi was on an older A321, with no personal screens. The seats were very comfortable with great seat pitch and traditional ""thick"" profile of the seats. Cabin crew were lovely and the meal was even better. There were some amenity kits given as well, except a bit smaller ones (which makes sense on a 3 hour daytime flight). You could access their entertainment via your own device and onboard wi-fi for free with no issues, and the selection was impressive, but the lack of power ports meant you will run out of power quite soon. Delhi to Almaty was practically the same as the flight from Almaty to Delhi. For Almaty - Moscow I have made a bet to upgrade on their website (the lowest amount possible), and we were upgraded to business. The flight on a Boeing 767 was wonderful with lie-flat seats, lots of privacy and space, great IFE and pleasant cabin. The cabin crew were very accommodating, greeting us with champagne as a pre-departure drink, and the purser greeted us by name, making sure we had a fantastic flight. Meals were delicious, each course was brought separately. If I could think of any improvement in business class, it would be alcohol menu, because there were just one type of champagne, one type of white and red wine (plus lots of spirits and cocktails). I believe the wine card can and should be improved. Their Bloody Mary was perfect, by the way. Almaty airport is an absolute disaster - it's small, crowded, with nowhere to sit or relax, no decent cafes, everyone is shouting at everyone. Even in business class lounge there is nothing to eat or drink for free, which is just a disgrace. Our luggage made it, and the flights were on time, though. To conclude, I recommend Air Astana, and the economy experience is outstanding, but I will try to fly via Astana next time, since Almaty airport is just so awful.",,,,,
" St Petersburg to Ust-Kamenogorsk via Almaty / Astana. Clean new cabin, perfect meal each way, especially from Astana. I have to mention that food cooked in Kazakhstan always better than from other airports. Wide choice of beverages. Good schedule : short connection in Astana on the way back to LED. KC TV app very useful and its good thing for flights no longer than 5 or 6 hours and cabin not equipped with personal entertainment system. Service unbelievably attentive. Absolutely recommended.",,,,,
"  St Petersburgh to Oskemen via Almaty. Clean new cabin, perfect meal each way, especially from Astana.  Wide choice of beverages. Even for the day flight they give you trip suite. Good schedule : short connection in Astana on the way back to LED. TV app very useful and its good thing for flights no longer than 5 or 6 hours and cabin not equipped with personal entertainment system. Service attentive. Absolutely recommended.",,,,,
"  St Petersburg to Bangkok via Almaty. There has been significant improvements to this airline in the fourteen years since I first flew. It was a day service between St Petersburg and Almaty on a clean A320. Seats were comfortable, spacious and with a reasonable recline. Food was good and well presented. In flight entertainment was on tablets and there was a reasonable selection. Cabin service was a little hit and miss - I asked for wine with my meal and by the time I realised that it had been forgotten I had finished and did not ask for it. The cabin crew spoke reasonable/good English but only spoke to me in Russian because initially I had spoken to them in Russian. The check in in St Petersburg was fast, efficient and in English. They had a bus for business class passengers to go to the plane. The flight departed and arrived on time and my luggage was among the first offloaded in Almaty. The Almaty - Bangkok sector was a night flight on a new Dreamliner 769 with a dinner type meal at about 2.30 am. Check in in Almaty was slow because the operator was dealing with problems for a couple of economy class passengers. (It would have been faster to use the economy check in counter)! Food was good and the seat/bed was comfortable and there was quite a selection of in flight entertainment. I was identified as a foreigner and so spoken to in good English. The plane left and arrived on time and again my luggage was amongst the first off the plane.",,,,,
"  Astana to Dubai. It was very nice family trip from start to finish. Everything about the flight was perfect, quick check-in, boarding, quality of special meal, reservation of seats and comfort, kids amenities, entertainment system, cleanness of cabin. I would only recommend to provide wifi access but cabin crew informed me that internet is available on some flights. Since I flew with my daughter of 4 years old I had things to do and hadn’t had a chance to enjoy internet anyway. Crew is very positive and i have been individually welcomed as a Silver member. Overall it was very memorable flight and I would recommend Air Astana!",,,,,
"  Kiev to Almaty. During my stay in Kiev transit, I was upgraded to business class, which made my day. On-board  service was professional, good english-speaking, good service. Food quality and presentation incl. menu fulfilled expectation without any complaints. Choice of beverages was interesting. Entertainment via wifi is working well, the provided screens on high quality. Air Astana are highly recommended from me.",,,,,
" Air Astana has practically a monopoly in the Central Asian region where I live and work and they don’t hesitate to remind the customer of that. I have travelled approximately 75-100 legs on this airline for business and have purchased several tickets to and from Moscow for both myself and my fiance. You’d think this sort of ‘loyalty’ (is it really loyalty when you consider the lack of available options?) would earn me a little more respect than what I received today, but judging from my experience with the gate agents contracted by the airline at various airports, all I seem to get is ignorance and hostility. Customer service is arguably not very highly esteemed in Central Asia in my experience so I’m long past expecting “service with a smile.” I was caught unawares today by a excess baggage fee when flying out of Dushabe. Apparently Air Astana has recently started offering bare bones fares whose limitations are in no way reflected in the pricing. These fares offer a downright insulting 1 kg baggage limit (10kg for Nomad Club Silver members) when the standard tickets allow for 20kg (30kg) respectively. I unknowingly booked this fare through a third-party website where there was no indication that this wasn’t a standard fare ticket. As I said, the ticket price wasn’t particularly cheap. I expect this sort of thing from FlyDubai or Wizz Air but from a national flagship airline? Seriously? Of course what incentive do you have to treat repeat customers well when you practically have a government-backed monopoly? And about the Nomad Club, it’s quite possibly the stingiest airline rewards program there is. Almaty Airport, the airline’s hub, is a glorified bus station which is insanely overcrowded, overpriced, and boring. On a positive note, the air crew staff are polite, if not exceedingly. Not the worst but not the best.",,,,,
 I have had to recently use some other airlines and this has reinforced my appreciation of Air Astana’s cabin services. Air Astana has set and manages to maintain exceptional high standards of service. Al the cabin crew appear to have fundamental English skills. The new uniform is fresh and professional. The safety video has been improved and is actually pleasant to watch even after many flights in a short time frame. The new aircraft have screens on the backs of the seats and passengers can select their entertainment. The new earphones are great and I always keep the set. The passenger pack is in a useful bag and the products inside are good but I miss the mini-biro pen. The food and beverages are of good quality with a proper cutlery. I have found the cabin crew to be attentive and responsive to my needs. Depending on the airport I have boarded check-in staff may not have the same consistency but my recent check in at Atyrau was good (this is not usually a friendly airport though there are some exceptional individuals working there). I would say without fear of reproach that Air Astana is my preferred airline of choice.,,,,,
" Flew Delhi to Astana with Air Astana. Fantastic service from cabin crew, and airport personnel. Improved meals. Still need to get personal TV screens on all seats, on all flights. The ""watching shows/films on my own personal device"" is a cheap way out, I definitely do not like this option. In the year 2018, all planes should have screens on all seats especially on long flights! Always feel safe on Air Astana flights! Air Astana is a top-notch airline!",,,,,
  Almaty to İstanbul in March 2018. There was no delay on flight. I remember smiling crew faces for that trip. There was delicious food and good entertainment for 6 hours flight. Note: wishing to see bigger planes for such a long vayage. ,,,,,
  Antalya to Almaty. I write to commend staff on an exceptional level of service when I traveled with Air Astana on the 23 May. The service I had was a superb experience throughout the flight. I trust that you will pass on this recognition to the specific staff members from this flight.,,,,,
"  Istanbul to Atyrau. I'm traveling for more than 15 years with this company (I am also a ""Nomad Club"" member as Gold). I can  recommend Air Astana since their prices even better than competitors in the region. The airline is improving. The last flight  was a safe, comfortable and pleasant flight. The staff is very nice and friendly the food is good. Topping all that were the good selection of movies on board.",,,,,
"  Tashkent to Almaty. Excellent food, high tech inflight entertainment via their application and on time. Although flight was only for one hour thirty minute crew was attentive. The only thing I would feel to improve to make announcements shorter since all are in three languages.",,,,,
" I am frequent flyer with Air Astana. Almaty – Dubai is the best available option.  The check in procedure at the business class counter works smoothly without any problems. Business lounge at Almaty Airport is not good. Boarding is OK, still some airport problems, not enough jet bridges. The seats are comfortable for a five hour flight if it is not a night flight. The catering is perfect, flight attendants are very attentive, beautiful smiles. The entertainment program is OK, we are provided with iPad in business class with good choice of the video programming. Internet is missing on this type of the aircraft.",,,,,
"  Frankfurt to Astana. It is my first time to refuse to bring my hand luggage because I have the computer backpack and a small handbag! The hand luggage is 9kg, but I took out a think book and said it could not account to the whole weight. They still not listen to me. i was refused to bring it on board and pay money as the overweight luggage. Afterwards I will select another airline but not Air Astana.",,,,,
"  Almaty to Dubai. Business class with 28 seats and 15 degree seat recline for more than 4 hours flight? First and second rows are for extra charge, that gave you no choice for meal. As they start asking meal preferences from back rows, by the first row it happens nothing to choose from. Only one restroom in business class. Broken multimedia system, tv screen did not work. Still there is least and not last - very nice crew members.",,,,,
  Almaty to Astana. The early morning flight allowed me to have the whole Sunday I could spend in Astana. We had a good breakfast in the aircraft. This year I enjoy my Silver Nomad. Despite of the downrating I was happy to know that Nomad Club members start to enjoy better scoring of points. Now we are 3 times quicker to collect the points necessary for the new tier or bonus ticket. Nomad Club develops well and I appreciate it. This weekend I will have my next flight to Almaty to enjoy running at Almaty Marathon that is also supported by Air Astana. As usual I expect good service from Air Astana that keeps me being a loyal client.,,,,,
"  I wanted to get a refund for a flight that I didn't take in January. Informed Air Astana in advance that I won't be able to travel. Asked to transfer my money back to another bank account as the old one was already closed. After three months of slow feedback, collecting all necessary papers by myself, contacting my previous bank in Asia, this company stopped answering my emails. But the strangest thing happened when they transferred my money to Cambodia, though I live in Ukraine. Though they said that ""your refund is in process"", now they just don't answer at all.",,,,,
"  Almaty to Kiev. Very good experience on this flight. The crew was very attentive and helpful,  and plenty of legroom considering we were on a 6 hour flight on A320. Amenities were great and they offer everything you need to enjoy the flight.",,,,,
" Excellent flight. This was quite different from the outbound KL-Almaty 10 days ago which was delayed 6 hours. The biz class is configured in 1-2-1, so every pax has his/her own aisle. The bed is flat at 180 degree (unlike the Air Astana 757). The service and food were excellent. While the TV screen was big, the choice of movies could have been improved. Air Astana, after the incidents with the outbound flight delay (Almaty - KL), you have redeemed yourself thanks to two of your very dedicated managers in the Kuala Lumpur operation. In addition, your b-class product in 767 is also way better than that of 757.",,,,,
 Excellent service from Air Astana team. A very pleasant flight of just under 4 hours flying from Moscow to Almaty. Service was exceptional and the crew very attentive. A very smooth flight and pilot was very careful with manoeuvres. Overall I was very impressed with this airline and felt very safe.,,,,,
  Bangkok to Almaty on Boeing 757. Quick and efficient check in and given priority pass and lounge invitation. Boarding was quick. Seats were angled flat but reasonably comfortable. Cabin crew were effective and had good English. Meals were quite tasty but not quite to the standard that I have come to expect from Air Astana. Flight was uneventful and landed a few minutes early. Luggage come quite quickly off the plane. Almaty to Moscow (A320) Early morning departure and the traditional sit up business seat with reasonable leg room and comfort. Food was a little disappointing compared to previous flights. Portable entertainment with reasonable selection of films although I mostly slept. Cabin crew were good and again had very good English skills. Plane left and landed on time and luggage came very quickly off the flight.,,,,,
"  Almaty to Kuala Lumpur. My final destination was Jakarta, but Air Astana could only check in my luggage until Kuala Lumpur as there was no facility to check in to another airline. The flight was delayed more than 3 hours from Almaty. Original departure time was 11:30PM - it was not until 2:50AM we boarded and left for KUL. During this time the flight time was changed at least 3 times - from 11:30PM, 2AM, 2:30AM and 2:40AM. There was no apology or information provided other than for technical reasons. Due to the delay I missed my connecting flight to Jakarta. The product flat bed is only 140 degree at the best. It is an old style low bed where you almost sleep on the floor. A 10 inch ipad was provided as an alternate to ptv. The movie selections are limited and nothing to rave about. The positive - no crowd in business class, great duvet and blankets, good service and great tasting food.",,,,,
"  Tehran to Tashkent via Almaty. At the moment I am in transit at Almaty airport (not the best airport to spend the night) but Air Astana pleased me on the flight from Tehran to Almaty. It is the first time I have flown with this airline. Excellent, punctual, well turned out crew. Polite. Clean toilets. Amazing service.",,,,,
" I booked a flight from Bangkok to Frankfurt (with a later connection to Valencia) at 23:00 local time. This flight was departing almost 7 hours later, at 5:50 am. However, when I approached the counter I found out the flight was already delayed to 19:00 pm. 13 hours delay! Ridiculous. And they let me buy the ticket from their own webpage. Most of the passengers accepted hotel and waiting, but ten of us couldn't wait. I explained to them about my connecting flight to Valencia and I accepted any possible route which would take me to Frankfurt on time or any part of Spain but they denied this option for four hours, insisting on my delayed flight with them as my only option (13h waiting in Bangkok airport plus 14h in Astana). Missing my connection to Valencia and being late for work. I even got the chance to talk to someone from management on the phone, but she would only say ""I'm sorry"". Only good part was their ground staff, which suffered this situation exemplary even though they were lacking the power to do something. Finally I accepted the refund of my ticket, which they signed, and booked a flight with another airline, spending a big amount of money to get to Madrid. After this, I was expecting the refund of the ticket, but they only offer me 3.930THB, which is not even a 1/4 of the amount I paid for the ticket. I have never in my life dealt with a despicable airline such as Air Astana. It makes me feel sad because they have really good staff onboard but, recommended? Of course not. They will ruin your holidays and feel ok about it.",,,,,
" A small gift provided on boarding the aircraft was a pleasant addition to the warm welcome for all the women travelling on IWD, a gesture which set the tone for a very pleasant return trip from Heathrow to Pavlodar. Each and everyone of the flight staff were friendly and helpful and very good representatives for the airline. There was more than ample space, I could stretch out on three seats and actually managed to sleep. The inflight entertainment was great and the safety notice really slick so I actually watched it in three languages. The catering and hospitality was super and I will look forward to flying with them once more. ",,,,,
" Whilst my journey from Bishkek to Alamaty was short, I found the flight to be a very pleasant event. The aircraft was quite modern and the seating was very comfortable. The safety advisory video was modern, novel and refreshing, rather than the traditional rushed human version. I found the Air Astana staff to be very pleasant and helpful. I would have no hesitation in recommending Air Astana for future flights. ",,,,,
" Flew Air Astana from Astana to Frankfurt. All very easy and positive, nice people, good food, comfortable seat and all on time, what more can you ask for? Wonderful safety video performed by silhouette actors, so good that I watched it in all three languages, very clever! Tablet screen just a little disappointing but had a good range of films.",,,,,
"  Astana to Paris. In general Air Astana offers decent service quality, acceptable food & entertainment on the board along with fairly new aircraft despite quite often being disproportionately expensive. I flew many times with them and never had problems until two days ago when they let me down real bad. When in the beginning of January they started offering promotion flights to several destination in March for their loyalty card holders, me and my sister decided to take advantage of it and planned our trip to Paris during Nauryz (3 day National holiday in Kazakhstan) in advance. However, on Monday they notified us that the flight has been changed from 21.03 to 23.03 due to ""Spring flight schedule corrections"", thus completely eliminating any chance of using these Holidays for a trip. These types of corrections are definitely planned way in advance and should have been addressed BEFORE offering promotions on the dates. Upon contacting their CS They declined to change flights or to compensate internal tickets. I'm deeply disappointed however, considering their near monopoly status in Kazakhstan i fear i cannot boycott them that easily. Shame on you Air Astana for scamming your frequent fliers.",,,,,
"  Moscow to Astana. Excellent flying experience. The company uses the newest and comfortable terminal of SVO, which is a definite plus. Very clean and new planes, comfortable seats with enough legroom. Entertainment system is on even during the short flights in economy. The travel kits including a toothbrush with toothpaste, sleeping mask, slippers and a pen is provided even in the economy class. Migration cards provided onboard to much convenience. The staff is extremely helpful, welcoming and nice. The food was absolutely delicious. Steel cutlery provided even in the economy, which is very nice. Great value for money.",,,,,
"  Astana to Almaty. Business class seat was comfortable but looks old style and pretty tired, not a flat bed though. For 1,5 hour flight is ok. Cabin crew was welcoming and supportive. Food was not designed to be served on morning flight as they served lunch or dinner menu (chicken and fish) instead of breakfast.",,,,,
"  This is a great connection between Almaty and Pavlodar allowing a return trip within 24 hours. I left Almaty for Pavlodar at 6.30 pm on Thursday and was back next day at 5 pm. Although I flew both ways on a smaller Embraer-190 plane, the flight was not long at all taking around 1h 40m in one direction. Both flights were on time, no delays whatsoever. The flight attendants were very friendly and welcoming. It was great to see that it is possible to use the KCTV flight entertainment on this flight via a mobile device - excellent service which will hopefully become available on all Air Astana airplanes. Overall a very good experience and thanks to Air Astana for maintaining high standards of performance on regional flights like this one.",,,,,
"  St Petersburg to Kamenogorsk via Astana, flights were in time. Cabin was clean, food was good, especially on the way from LED to TSE and service excellent. Inflight entertainment before I boarded, I got app KCTV to use aboard, this app for cabin WiFi. For me selection of movies should be wider, but when your trip just about 3-4 hours, it is enough. In some planes they still don't have WiFi or captain forgets to turn it on. New terminal in Astana is very good but for passengers flying to countries from former USSR, which now are Customs Union members they don't sell even water in duty free stores because of union's rules (they can't sell alcohol and all stuff with additional tax fee). ",,,,,
"  London to Dushanbe via Astana and Almaty. 2.5 hrs delay at Heathrow due to broken brakes. No TVs, chargers or AC on the very old plane. Due to the delay I missed my connection and am stuck in Almaty for 2 nights which I assumed Air Astana were paying for, but the hotel they've just put me up in have just come and asked for payment. Total shambles. Never flying with them if I can avoid it. Staff all very friendly and helpful.",,,,,
" Astana to London. Air Astana provided me with great assistance at a time when I needed a relaxed easy journey. All staff I encountered were polite and helpful. There were no delays or issues at any point. Plane journey was smooth and arrived on time. Seats were comfortable and food served was delicious, not just for airline food. Entertainment on board is lacing with each seat needed a screen rather than one between rows. Easy booking process and very flexible airline with a personal touch that goes a long way. Will fly Air Astana again.",,,,,
" Hong Kong to Almaty with Air Astana was amazing. Business class has extremely comfortable beds with your choice of a regular blanket or a lovely plush duvet. Food is terrific with at least four choices for the main course, lovely appetizers and soup. The flight attendants and crews cannot do enough to make you at home. The magazine and media selection is wonderful. Traveling with my eight-year-old daughter was especially nice. Air Astana has an amazing National Geographic branded children's kit which was a huge hit!",,,,,
"  Almaty to Bangkok. New plane, nice crew and very good service. I travel with family and also like treatment of my small children - they provide attention, and give gifts. The travel kit in economy class is also great. Excelllent qualty. The pilot kept great contact with passengers. I am really proud of our national carrier Air Astana.",,,,,
"  Moscow to Almaty, A321 is new aircraft with about 32 seats in business, not flat bed but for the 4 hours flight, the seat is enough. The food is good. Rich variety and tasty. Services of flight attendants are very nice, attentive and good. The entertainment system is provided through IPADs, it is good choice, but I would increase the number of the product -if you travel often, you watch everything. Generally, in my experience, it is always on time.",,,,,
"  I was flying from London to Almaty via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. I had planned to arrive in Almaty 3 days before the wedding. However, due to the heavy snow fall, the airport at Istanbul closed. I was stranded, without my luggage, and so worried that I would not arrive in time for my wedding as the earliest flight Turkish Airlines could offer was on the day of my wedding. My fiancé saw Air Astana were able to fly earlier and bought me a ticket. I was stranded, without my luggage, not knowing what was happening and when I would be arriving with my fiancé but Air Astana were wonderful and very professional. The cabin crew were a credit to Air Astana. I will certainly fly again with them and recommend. ",,,,,
"  Personnel au sol et navigant très agréable et attentif. Bonne ponctualité . Les sièges sont confortables en économie tout comme en sleeper eco . Très bonne qualité de services de manière générale . Les repas sont également de qualité. Le transit à Astana est très facile et les connexions sont bonnes. Très bon rapport qualité prix pour cette compagnie que je recommande vivement. Staff on the ground and navigator very pleasant and attentive. Good punctuality. The seats are comfortable in economy as in sleeper eco. Very good quality of services in general. Meals are also quality. The transit to Astana is very easy and the connections are good. Very good value for money for this company that I highly recommend.

"  Bangkok to Almaty return. First time flying with Air Astana and was incredibly impressed. The service from ticketing, check in to on board was exceptional. Travelling with a baby can often be tiring and stressful however they accommodated our needs every step of the way. On return we had a quick transfer in BKK to another airline. Air Astana staff were able check our luggage right through to the final destination & tagged it to ensure ground crew knew of the urgency. All went very smoothly and we made connections with zero fuss and; our bags arrived first on carousel. I highly recommend Air Astana and look forward to flying them again.",,,,,
  Bangkok to Almaty. I travelled with the Air Astana for the first time and it exceeded my expectations. The airline staff was responsive and extremely attentive. No issue with any request.  The food variety and quality was outstanding (I am considered to be picky).  The seats were very comfortable whether you wish to sleep or watch a movie. It was the best flight experience I have had.,,,,,
"  Air Austral is terrible. We booked a flight to the Seychelles with a layover in La Reunion. Then they changed the first flight to one day earlier and the second flight to four days later. So we were supposed to stay 5 days in La Reunion instead of a few hours. We would loose 4 days out of 7 on the Seychelles. Of course we don’t accept this proposal. Online we just could ""accept"" the change. So we went to an Air Austral office to not accept and cancel this flights, that it want be a no-show. To contact Air Austral online we need to wait 20 days for an answer. The guy in the office confirmed us, that he cancelled it and we must ask for the refund on the homepage of Air Austral, what we did. So we did everything that's possible, but the answer of Air Austral is nope. They don’t give us the refund of the flights! Of course we are very upset and will never ever again book with them. What a bad service. By the way, we are frequent flyer and never had a similar issue like this.",,,,,
"  We reached airport with my children and they mandated to do RT PCR test to return from Mauritius to india for my children who is only 5 years old and not yet attained 6. In the website they have not mentioned that a RTPCR is required for children for age 5. When i said it is their duty to inform the passengers about the mandatory documents to carry for boarding ,they said it should be known by you. First he asked me to take RTPCR test for entire family even after i have shown him the fully vaccinated certificate. Food served in the flight from reunion to Chennai is the worst food. They changed the travel date all of a sudden. Earlier it was booked for 27 July from Chennai and then they rescheduled to 30th. ",,,,,
" We booked the return flights for two people last October via Opodo and couldn't go due to the Covid restriction. We cancelled the flights immediately and Opodo helped us proceed. However, the airline company Air Austral did not issue the refund even when they have confirmed the cancellation. And every time we asked about it, they threw the problem to Covid, which is not reasonable. It has been 5 months already that they did not proceed the refund.",,,,,
" Mauritius to Madagascar via Reunion Island. The flight has been delayed from 4 to 7 and now 9.15 pm, no communication or support from the ground staff. They knew about the delay before the departure from Mauritius but did not inform the customers. Acces to lounge was given only after insistence from us and only to who has asked for it, not to all afected travelers, and no airline representative has spoken to us, as we should be grateful for the lounge access. No alternative connection was offered. Kids and old people were left without even water and waiting confused. Very unprofessional staff and airline!",,,,,
"  Johannesburg to St Denis. Service like it was 30 years ago, professional, attentive, amenity kit handed out on a 3 hour flight, and the quality and quantity of the catering I've not seen for years. Thoroughly recommended.",,,,,
"  I have flown with the airline at least six flights in the last three years. So far, I am pleased with the airline's punctuality and the services of flight attendants on board. Unfortunately, my 2019 flight in 23 June was very unpleasant. Started from at least the 15-hour delay of the flight, and there was not at all any special offer on board. The delay caused me to pay more at the hotel. The latest flight in July was terrible. Boeing 787-8 was booked, but A330 I was in. Headache during the flight , and asked for pills from the attendant but it was ignored. Terrible.",,,,,
  Paris to Reunion. Air Austral is a fairly good airline. The seat layout of the Airbus A330-200 was 2x4x2. The leg room was not too bad. In-flight entertainment was good and worked well. Cabin service was average but generally fine. The flight was on time.,,,,,
"  La Réunion to Paris. We missed our connection flight because of the delay of the the first flight with Air Austral. The worst thing about was the service of the staff at the airport at CDG. At first they denied to speak English and booked us for a flight 7 hours later, but other travelers were book on an earlier flight with the same destination. Vouchers for food or drinks were also denied although it is EU law. It was the impoliteness and ignorance of the staff that made the experience with Air Austral this bad.",,,,,
"  Reunion to Chennai. We were really disappointed in this Air austral. Around 13 hrs delay, they dint provide lounge, and food to still for 4 hours and then all complaint the ground staff and then they issue a burger and one drinks. All ground staff is not at all responding. It’s really bad service.",,,,,
"  We had to give up our luggage in Paris CDG on the return flight from Reunion, for the onward flight to Frankfurt, although no airport change took place. Reason: The gate for the onward flight to Frankfurt was too far away from the gate where we arrived !! Despite a complaint about the baggage claim in St. Denis, the responsible supervisor decided that. Was an unpleasant and stressful experience. On the one hand, because of the relatively short time window and on the other hand because of the many and sometimes also heavy luggage, which we push forever through Paris CDG and also had to transport an elevator and a bus. Wir mussten beim Rückflug aus Reunion unser Gepäck in Paris CDG erneut aufgeben, für den Weiterflug nach FFM, obwohl kein Flughafenwechsel stattgefunden hat. Begründung: Das Gate für den Weiterflug nach FFM sei von dem Gate, an dem wir angekommen sind, zu weit entfernt !! Trotz Reklamation bei der Gepäckaufgabe in St. Denis hat der zuständige Supervisor so entschieden. War eine unangenehme und stressige Erfahrung. Zum einen, wegen des relativ knappen Zeitfensters und zum anderen wegen des vielen und teilweise auch schweren Gepäcks, das wir ewig weit durch Paris CDG schieben und zudem in einen Fahrstuhl sowie einen Bus verfrachten mussten.",,,,,
"  This airline is shambolic. Our direct flight from Paris to Dzaoudzi was cancelled and another given after 3hours but via Reunion. On arrival in Reunion, shoved in my face a letter of apology. Agents very stand offish. Nothing offered, not even water. Crying babies, elderly customers not taken care of. Just herded like cattle to a small gate area. On embarking from Reunion to Dzaoudzi our baggage could be seen on tarmac but not loaded. Advised Purser and Captain but they shrugged shoulders. On arrival in RUN, a total of 8 hours late with no luggage. On return flight to Paris CDG we were advised maybe a stop in East Africa, then told once on plane, going direct. Served a freezing cold salad as an entree and thats all. A dry baby croissant for breakfast, but were made to feel grateful. We pay for service and products but must be grateful for something! I contacted Air Austral under EU LAW 261/2004 for my refund as laid out under EU Legislation & after 17 emails ignoring me, I contacted a third party attorney. Sure enough they are paying up my refund. I can only say, this airline is awful. They hold you to ransom after you pay your hard earned money, treat you like you are doing them a favour, glare at you when questioned, ignore the law they are contractually bound to, serve you cold salad for dinner, lose your luggage, contact you after 6 months once summoned by a lawyer, tell you where they are taking you with no chance to deplane if you need to change your plan. The situation is their Boeing 787 has many technical problems, the Boeing 777 is too big to land in Mayotte, so instead of being truthful, they just lie. Still, they are supposedly 3star?",,,,,
"  I wasn't a happy guy. There was an outbreak of pneumonic plague and especially in Antananarivo/Tana. So, I changed my return flight to avoid Tana and instead opted for my return from Nosy Be. The agent repeatedly said there would be no change fee due to the plague. Made perfect sense to me. I wanted to avoid a plague area! When I did change they had charged me the €70 change fee and they would not budge. Very bad attitude! The flights are horrendously expensive. I mean, I could fly DUB-MRU (Mauritius) for €700 return and this hop between islands cost me close to €500 return. They seem to have the routes tied up with Air Madagascar, would I be a cynic for thinking there may be a total lack of competition between them? More competition needed her ASAP! A two-star due to the change fee and cost of the flights!",,,,,
"  Flew Bangkok to Antananarivo via Saint-Denis. We were pleasantly surprised by Air Austral: the flights were on time, the aircraft relatively new, the amenities were good, and the IFE was ok. On the BKK-RUN segment, a pouch is provided with socks and eye shade in Y class. Wine is provided with meals. The staff tended to disappear after meal service, but they were friendly enough.",,,,,
"  Nosy Be (Madagascar) to Paris CDH via Reunion. The connecting flight was cancelled so had overnight stay in Reunion. Then next day flight was earlier than the original schedule, so had to overnight in Paris. The promised hotel booked by Air Austral was not honoured - had to chase to get refund for hotel booked myself. Still waiting for compensation, that was agreed by Air Austral, despite continued emails. They just keep stalling. Unfair and gives a terrible impression of Air Austral.",,,,,
"  Reunion to Johannesburg with Air Austral. One of the worst experience I have had. After we took off from Reunion, the flight had to go back to Reunion because of the technical fault. When we arrived at the airport nobody from the airline bothered to explain the next step and nobody at the airline spoke English. We only saw on the boarding gate the time for departure. This made us miss our connecting flight. Upon arrival at Johannesburg we tried to negotiate with the Manager and ask her to find flights home for us. She said there was nothing she can do for us. I can assure everybody who wants to take this airline that cheap is expensive. We ended up rebooking our flights.",,,,,
"  Great little airline. Although we left one hour late, the service for a 4 hour flight was outstanding from Johannesburg to Reunion. Even in Economy Class, you receive an amenity kit, a hot towel, and a full hot meal with first course, desert, and free wine and liquors. This was followed by a great French movie with subtitles on drop down screens every 4 rows. A great way to start a magical vacation on a paradise destination in the Indian Ocean.
",,,,,
"Paris to La Réunion. I was very disappointed with my flight on Air Austral - very damaged seats, small, uncomfortable, dirty. Due to health problems I have to eat neither fat nor sugar, so I always order a light meal except that Air Austral on this meal ""exceptional"" also has a price exceptional and is discriminatory. The meal costs the astronomical sum of 20 € for all that ultimately end up with a meal with fat! Between the outward and return flight I had email exchanges with the company following this concern and frankly they had nothing to do and were very ironic in their responses do not take seriously at all my problem, sending me a vegetarian menu instead of the light except that eating vegetarian has nothing to do with not eating fat and sugar. Staff incompetent. Movies and music were poor.",,,,,
A very pleasant experience with Air Austral. The food was above average for economy. The movie choice was a bit limited but there was enough in English to keep us entertained. As much to drink as you wanted. The onboard crew were outstanding - friendly and professional. The best economy cabin crew I have experienced for a long time. It is also by far the best route to Madagascar (and especially Nosy Be with a direct flight from St Denis).,,,,,
CDG-RUN return. Air Austral is the airline of Réunion Island owned by the local public authorities. On the good side food is average but not too bad particularly main dishes. FA are smiling and very attentive ground staff really nice. Boarding was very well organised. A small travel kit is provided with socks. Pillows are wide. Cabin looks fine although a bit ageing in Y. New livery on the planes is really great. On the downside choice of films on the IFE is surprisingly limited and most French films - and seats are really narrow because of 3-4-3 configuration on B777 particularly exit seats. All in all I find its service to be slightly better than AF and Air Mauritius on this area.,,,,,
Sydney-Reunion-CDG return May/June 2012. After reading mixed reviews here we were a little apprehensive at first but booked anyway because of price and also short stop over times. Staff were friendly upon initial check in blocking the seat next to us so we had more room. Actually the only flight we had to sit next to someone else was Reunion-CDG. Entertainment selection was great and the staff were very friendly and attentive. Food was tasty and very sufficient. And the care packs with socks ear plugs sleep mask and headphones were a nice touch. On return flight Reunion-Sydney the plane was virtually empty so we had a row of seats each as did most other passengers in the cabin. Again staff were very attentive constantly offering drinks throughout the flight. All in all we had an extremely pleasant experience and have no hesitation flying with them again. Have recommended Air Austral and will continue to.,,,,,
"Departed Jorge Newbury Airport (AEP) Buenos Aires to Galeão-(GIG) Rio de Janeiro. Flight number AR 2252- 22 August 2012. Embraer 190 aircraft. Arrived at the airport in time for a 9.50am departure. There were many announcements in Spanish but very few in English until English speaking passengers enquired at departure gates. Flight was 1 hour late with no explanation given. Flight itself was fantastic however cabin crew were less than friendly and did not even check our boarding pass to direct us to our assigned seat as we boarded. Inflight ""snack"" was some sort of carrot cake caramel filled biscuit covered in a white chocolate substance with a caramel sweet.",,,,,
Sydney-Reunion-Mauritius. Cabin crew extremely rude simple requests such as glasses of water plainly ignored. Food was sub standard and if you felt peckish after the meal you were abruptly told to go help yourself at the rear of the plane to a platter of soggy cheese and butter sandwiches. Same for drinks pour- your-own-glass at the back of the pane in full view of the cabin crew who just pretended you didn't exist. Overall cabin crew appeared quite blasé and pompous.,,,,,
Excellent trip between New Caledonia and St Denis of La Reunion. Onward and return on a Boeing 747 with good comfort on seats. Individual screens. Excellent service and good meals. The pitch was just too little for me and that's why I just give 9 and not 10.,,,,,
Mauritius to Reunion return. Onward flight was on a Boeing 737-800 with only a 20% load so we had enough space during that 20 mins flight. Service was a cookie and juice which was nice. Return flight was on a ATR 72 aircraft with the same service. Crew was friendly and helpful. Flights and bags where on time. Would fly them again even ticket price is quite high.,,,,,
Flew to Mauritius and my experience was unsatisfactory. The service was appalling. I pressed the hostess button numerous times with no response. One meal throughout the journey was inadequate with a very small snack before landing. My snack was a soggy sandwich and breakfast was no better. I will not recommend this airline. Quality is of the essence.,,,,,
NOU-RUN-MRS return. The overall service and meals were beyond expectations for a French airline crews were polite professional and present throughout the cabin. All flights with brand new B773 are pleasant with PTV's and conformable seats. The only flight with B772 was on the MRS-RUN leg and it was a shame because no PTV on this ageing aircraft. However the transit area in Saint Denis La Réunion airport definitely needs to be revamped there is nothing Air Austral can do about it but I hope this will be modernised shortly.,,,,,
MRU-RUN-SYD-NOU return. High level of service across the board. No difference between flying on an ATR 72-500 and a B777-300. The crew were well groomed polite and efficient. Great Creole cuisine with a French savoir fare. Hot meals for the main services and good open sandwiches in between. On Demand Entertainment System worked well with plenty of choices. International magazines available. Clean lavatories.,,,,,
SYD-CDG return. I have travelled to Europe several times and never look forward to it. Booking and check-in no problem staff and service was very good. The addition of a TGV ticket to get me closer to my destination was much appreciated and connection was easy. My only quibble was a limited entertainment selection.,,,,,
SYD to Mauritius. Excellent service and quite comfortable for Economy class. Flight attendants friendly always coming through the cabin with water. Plenty of food provided.,,,,,
Sydney to Noumea Business Class. Fast check in at Sydney Airport they use the Qantas Club which was nice. Boarding delayed for 45minutes due to late arriving aircraft. Business Class roomy and seats comfortable not lie flat but very angled. Crew spoke mainly French and some broken English - but they are a French Airline. Food good service attentive and friendly didn't use the inflight entertainment. Overall not a bad product.,,,,,
SYD-RUN-SEZ. Very attentive crew . Good and adequate food crew offering water . Leather seats comfortable and clean 777-300. More IFE options of movies and other programmes would make it better.,,,,,
Sydney-Reunion-Mauritius. Not impressed staff sometimes quite rude. One meal with drinks provided after take off soggy sandwich about half way and small snack before landing. Drinks few and far between we could go and help ourselves to warm drinks with no ice. Overall would not fly Air Austral again and would not recommend it. Return flight not better!,,,,,
Paris to St-Denis (Reunion) in Business Class. Seat is comfortable food is perfect and staff very friendly. In St-Denis lounge we got champagne and apetizers vry nice. Compared to Air France this company is excellent!,,,,,
MEL to MRU via Sydney and Reunion with Air Austral. Overall nice experience although the flight is long. On the long haul flight meals are quite good and there are quite a lot of things on the platter. Before landing a snack is served. Sandwiches and beverages are provided during the whole flight. On short haul drinks only are served. Flight attendants are quite efficient but can barely speak English fluently. No individual screens.,,,,,
CDG-RUN-ZSE. Outstanding service for the economy class good food very nice ground staff and crew. Fleet is modern with B777 with high quality entertainment system. Seat pitch tight and slightly cramped. RUN airport is small and allows very short connecting time if need to continue journey to east or Saint Pierre airport.,,,,,
Flew Air Austral Syd-Run-Mauritius-Run-Syd – it is 100% better then Air Mauritius. The food was great and flight attendants were excellent and friendly. I’ve got a 19 month old so they kept the middle seat for us - free and they kept offering to help and asked if everything was ok. The only drawback is theres no PTV and not much info from cockpit.,,,,,
Flew Air Austral return Sydney to Mauritius. Male flight attendants on the flight to RUN - nice however food provided is limited and alcohol only during meal times. Water is in short supply and passengers at the back of the plane were forgotten about almost all the time and rationing of water became an issue towards the end of the journey. Passengers were made to stay overnight in RUN - hotel stay provided to some passengers were terrible no assistance from the airline or hotel and dinner not provided (incur at passenger's expense). Return flight home was canceled with no word to most passengers (only upon check-in). Flight was canceled due to poor maintenance of the plane which suffered system difficulties on it's previous long haul journey and was forced to attempt emergency landing 3 times - and we were going to take this plane home! Was put up again at the same terrible hotel for the night. Female flight attendants extremely rude impatient and unwilling to communicate to passengers who cannot speak fluently in French. Very disappointed in the service provided by Air Austral will not fly again.,,,,,
Noumea to Sydney found Air Austral staff friendly and good customer service. My only issue was the size of the seats in economy - a tight fit.,,,,,
Only flew Air Austral for medium haul (RUN-SEY) but was excellent! Good service much space good food and very friendly staff! Next time we might choose them also for long haul.,,,,,
CDG-RUN-CDG: Checkin at CDG was fast and even faster at RUN. Very friendly staff at both airports and during flight. 777 are in good shape and the cabin clean and comfortable. Food was excellent - also a lot of choice for drinks including wine during dinner. Cabin crew present and often come along with water during the night. An amenity kit is distributed after takeoff with socks earphones earplugs and eyemask. Only drawback is that there are no PTV's and there's not much info from the cockpit. All in all a very good experience.,,,,,
CDG-RUN-CDG in Club Austral (Business) class. October - November 2006. Quick check-in nice lounges (although poor drink and snack selections) at both CDG and RUN. All flights perfectly on time quick delivery of luggage on arrival. Business class seat comfort (old) business class IFE (not on demand) first class service and meals. Overall a very nice product much cheaper than Air France and much better (at least compared to AF current B747 on this route ; new AF product using B777 is expected in 2007). Minor drawbacks : frequent flyer program does not seem on par with AF one ; CDG airport is further from Paris than ORY (which AF uses).,,,,,
JNB-RUN-JNB. I have travelled with Air Austral 4 times between Johannesburg and Reunion. My first trip was in 1992 - my latest was in November 2005. Before my latest trip I was of the opinion that they were one of the best airline I had flown economy class. Their B737's were configured 100% economy. Now they have a 'Business Class' and economy seems to have deteriorated to 'Cattle Class' - and they are 'just another airline'. All of their service levels have dropped to mediocre. I still plan to use them again this year as I love the island and Air Austral are the only airline that flies from Johannesburg to Reunion.,,,,,
I haven't had such a good quality of service or food on a tourist-class ticket in over 15 years (or more!). Our choice of Air Austral the first time was based mainly on the basis of our connection possibilities from Denmark. Next time it will be as a choice made by satisfied and loyal customers that believe that good treatment should be rewarded.,,,,,
I recently flew to Reunion on Air Austral and was very impressed. I found the service was excellent and far superior to that of Air France.,,,,,
I currently live in London and I fly once a year to Reunion for holidays. I use to fly on Air France in classe Alize (Economy Plus) but recently I tried Air Austral for the first time in Classe Loisirs (Economy) and was far more satisfied with the level of customer care in terms of punctuality high food quality and friendly staff. As being part of the Air France Frequence Plus scheme the good news is I can get some qualifying miles and this code-share flight makes my life easy as I don't need to change airport - ie remaining in CDG and not going to Orly. So I would recommend Air Austral in terms of: Comfort: their B777 is modern the seats are more comfortable and you have more space to put your hand luggage in the compartments above your head. Food: even in Classe Loisirs you have a huge plateau and you are really spoilt. Customer care: excellent staff. They provide you with warm towels as you get on board and in the morning. They also pass through at night asking you if you want some water while everyone is asleep. Everything with a smile! Punctuality: both outbound and return flights left on time. Unfortunately I read that Air France will stop this code-share flight with Air Austral and I find this decision very sad. I wish everyone who is part of Frequence Plus loyalty scheme to convince Air France to come back to its decision as the CDG-RUN-CDG must not disappear. Air Austral is the getaway to Reunion via CDG for all European and worldwide customers and you won't be disappointed. Thanks to Air Austral we are getting better airline service to Reunion excellent staff quality and well-deserved comfort. I'm very happy about their level of professionalism and the image the airline portrays of Reunion Island.,,,,,
I flew this with this airline around the Indian Ocean with this airline for business purposes. There punctuality is great they are more often before time rather than on time. Recently i got the opportunity to try there new RUN-CDG-RUN flight in club class. Here also am very satisfied. There REPS in Mauritius are very competent. I recommend you this airline.,,,,,
I'm used to fly with the french national airline because I'm a top-tier Frequence Plus cardholder but I have decided to try Air Austral on a trip from Reunion Island to Paris return in Business Class (they call it Club Austral). I have not been disappointed. The onboard crew was extremely helpful and smiley from boarding to disembarking. The seat which can recline 140 degrees -almost flat bed - is very comfortable good width and pitch. The food is tasty and includes a creole dish accompanied with spicy condiments and an interesting variety of wines. Even the bread is warm unlike other airlines I'm used to travel with. I have been especially impressed by the quality of the service on board and this from the FA to the captain. Good work.,,,,,
RGN-SNW. Quick boarding with allocated seating for 45 minute flight in ATR72 to Ngapali Beach. Good safety briefing before time take off and light snack and drink en route. Pleasant FA's smooth flight and great landing over the surf and through the palm trees to this small exRAF WW11 strip on the Bay of Bengal. Luggage is delivered by handcart to the entrance gates-expect to pay 500kyat per piece.,,,,,
Flew 2 internal flights in Burma with this local airline. Surprisingly new plane pretty much on time and with very pleasant crews. Also served a good snack gave out towels although flights were only about 45 minutes. Was a bit reticent about using them but very pleasantly surprised.,,,,,
Flew on four separate legs within Myanmar and found them to be surprisingly good. You don't normally expect catering on flights of under an hour but there was something on all segments. Arrived in good time at Heho Airport for a flight to Yangon and they automatically put me on to an earlier departure. There is a certain amount of third world amateurism about the boarding process but it all seemed to work.,,,,,
Took two domestic flights on Air Bagan one from Yangon to Bagan and another Mandalay to Yangon. Both flights were with ATR-72 aircraft. The interior of this aircraft was very cramped with hardly any leg space. The aircraft definitely showed its old age. The flight from Mandalay to Yangon was free seated and flight was completely full. The in-flight service was nice and they served savoury croissants and cakes with drinks. Regarding reservations the booking system is fairly tricky. Also the airline requires the passenger to confirm the flights at least 24 hours before departures. Yet the 4 phone lines are constantly busy. For both flights our hotels repeatedly tried calling to no avail. Air Bagan offers value for money because there is hardly any competitive alternative today.,,,,,
Recently flew throughout Myanmar on the following routes: Yangon-Mandalay-Heho-Mandalay-Nyaung U (Bagan)-Heho-Thandwe-Yangon on their Fokker 100 and ATR72 aircraft. Check-in interesting as there are no computers and everything is weighed manually. Ground crew cordial but not overly friendly. Flight crews were friendly and always helpful. Catering is good for the short flights with croissants and drinks being offered on even the shortest of flights (unthinkable in Europe). Aircraft's were always spotless and comfortable.,,,,,
Ground service is terrible compared to in the air. Manual check-in process with no computers. This airline seems to be the only one to have a lounge in the domestic terminal in Yangon. Air-conditioned and friendly associates offering a cheese croissant. No bathroom inside so that was a drag. People in Lotus class got a private van to the plane which was nice compared to cramming onto a bus. Onboard the flight was pretty good. The front of the plane is much quieter compared to the back. Their inflight magazine was pretty decent and the english grammatically correct. Even on short flights they gave you food. On my YGN-MDY flight which was about 50 minutes they served a full breakfast. Seats were pretty comfortable on par with United A320 first class seats. I don't really see the need for inflight entertainment on such short flights.,,,,,
Yangon-Bagan. ATR-72. Decent plane old and tired but as you'd expect from an airline in Burma. There was 1 cabin crew member and the co-pilot. Very pleasant service and a nice cheese croissant for the flight. Completely empty so you could stretch out over two seats which is important for me being 6ft 3.,,,,,
Chiang Mai to Yangon return and pleasantly surprised by the standard - fairly new aircraft and meal service for 50 minute flight. Flight attendants were somewhat offhand. Reasonable leg room in economy.,,,,,
Four internal flights in the last three weeks. Three on time one an hour late and this because a party of VIPs decided to turn up an hour after the scheduled take-off time. All flights satisfactory. Planes in OK condition. Even on short flights we were served refreshments. Nothing computerised and the whole process completed manually. When joining flights outside Yangon (the starting point for most flights) there is 'free' seating. This is because the systems are unable to work out which seats are vacated at each stop.,,,,,
Yangon to Lashio in November 2009 ATR 42 plane. Allocated seating and good snack served with excellent customer service. Would fly with them again any time!,,,,,
MDL-SND-RGN on ATR . Flights were always in time the planes are modern staff is very pleasant and we felt very safe on board. Check in without problems free seating and even for bigger people sufficient legroom . Would fly again with Air Bagan,,,,,
RGN-SNW-RGN. Modern ATR 42 aircraft good safety briefing very quick turnaround with seat allocation on way out (70% full) and free seating on return. Aircraft departure on time and luggage off quickly each time. Snack soft drink and tea/coffee on short 45 minute flight. Great views from 16000ft over Irrawaddy plain and Arakan hills and exciting approach over the sea and surf to short landing strip between the palm trees. Good experience.,,,,,
RGN-HEH and NYU-MDL-HEH-RGN. All flights on time clean planes even the older Fokker 100 a nice in flight snack and very friendly flight attendants. Since I was traveling in the off season most of the passengers were actually local with a few package tourists on the return leg. Boarding passes handwritten you must also show your passport for domestic flights in Myanmar.,,,,,
Yangon to Heho via Nyaung U in February with Air Bagan very pleasant. Inflight experience good with clean cabins and nice and attentive crew. They served even on this short flight a little breakfast with cold-cuts and cold omelette which was ok. As the previous comment states the problem is rather the infrastructure on the ground. Everything is still very old fashioned with hand written tickets and passenger lists and baggage handled by hand or on trolleys pushed by man as well and power shortage even in public airport areas. Booked through local travel agent who kept us informed of flight changes so saved us the hassle to deal with airline ticket sales directly. As we were on a holiday it was a bizarre but entertaining experience and it felt like what airtravel must have been like 50 years ago.,,,,,
Yangon-Thandwe(Ngapali)-Yangon. The flights were operated by ATR-42. Seating is not comfortable unless you take an emergency-exit row but on 40-50 minute flight you don't need comfortable seats. Inflight service great. Wet paper towels given to each passenger on the entrance to the plane. The food service was rather interesting - they gave us a chicken sandwich (really tasty) then they brought around some coffee and tea and about 10 minutes later-Cola and Sprite on a tray. Crew were very friendly and polite. Yangon Airport in its domestic part is really not modern with some not- functioning facilities and broken toilets. Thandwe airport is an experience itself! Overall Air Bagan offers excellent reliable service and I will fly it again when visiting a wonderful country Myanmar!,,,,,
Air Bagan may be Myanmar’s fastest growing airline even having international ambitions but we had the experience they are not really that well organized internally. We booked a number of domestic flights with them and tickets were written out with OK status on February the 12th when we picked them up in their downtown Yangon office. A week later when we checked in at Nyaung U for a NYE-HEH flight Air Bagan staff told us flight AKY-RGN we booked was cancelled and we had to contact Air Bagan in Taunggyi once we arrived in HEH to arrange alternative travel. After arrival in HEH we contacted Air Bagan in Taunggyi who told us no flights were cancelled. We asked them to verify this again and later that night Air Bagan called us we didn’t have to worry and the AKY-RGN flight would certainly fly. A few days later we flew HEH-SNW and as we had a reservation to fly SNW-AKY the next day we once more checked with Air Bagan at SNW airport on the AKY-RGN flight. We now were told AKY-RGN was cancelled as AKY airport would be closed ‘for maintenance’ for several days! The SNW-AKY we booked would still operate but as return flights for the next days would not operate we of course decided to cancel SNW-AKY. Air Bagan didn’t seem to understand why we didn’t want to fly SNW-AKY. Having no return flight from AKY didn’t seem to be an issue for them and they suggested us to buy a full fare SNW-RGN flight. They agreed to refund us the cancelled flights (after paying a cancellation fee) but refund could only be made in the Air Bagan office where we paid the tickets! This would mean we had to go back to downtown Yangon what we hadn’t planned into our travel schedule anymore. After several discussions with Air Bagan staff in SNW and with the help of our hotel manager in Ngapali the next day when we showed up at SNW airport for the SNW-RGN flight local Air Bagan staff appeared to be very helpful and tickets were paid back at SNW airport and fare for the SNW-RGN was ‘Town Office’ and not ‘Published’ full fare. We were very pleased local Air Bagan staff in SNW understood the issue and willing as well to refund us but next time I book a flight with them I’ll think twice.,,,,,
"  Florence to London via Dusseldorf in September 2017. First flight from Florence delayed by 3 hours, resulting in missed connection. This wouldn't have been an issue, especially considering the airline was meant to reimburse all customers for costs of the delay. However, my checked baggage was misplaced. Again, this wouldn't have been an issue under normal circumstances. I spoke to the baggage handler who told me to come talk to him prior to the next mornings flight, which was due to leave at 6am. I was forced to pay for a taxi which totalled 100 Euro each way (with promises of reimbursement) to the hotel which the company had placed passengers in only to stay there for 4 hours before having to leave again to catch the rescheduled flight. When I went to see the baggage handler I wasn't able to find anyone in the department. I went to the Air Berlin help desk and after explaining the situation to the woman at the desk she said there was nothing she could do. I asked if she was able to call the person who handled baggage as I needed to put my checked luggage on the new flight and she said she could but wasn't going to. When I asked again, saying ""Please, I need to catch my flight on time. I can't wait for someone to answer me knocking at the door, my flight leaves in less than an hour and I have to go through security"" She promptly said to me (in these exact words) ""Why don't you just do everyone a favour and go away."" I flew to my destination sans baggage and deeply offended. Being under 19 years old at the time and a solo flyer I am to this day outraged by the lack of sympathy and understanding of the customer support team. I had to wait 4 whole weeks for my luggage to arrive at my final destination. The airline owes me over 500 Euros in reimbursement, which it has managed to avoid paying due to their own fiscal troubles. I hope this airline is never resurrected and that no one is treated like that in there travels.",,,,,
"  Düsseldorf to Catania via Rome. Booked Alitalia, got Air Berlin. I was prepared for delays and even cancellations, because of the insolvency of Air Berlin. And indeed: our original inbound flight from Catania tot Düsseldorf with a change in Milan was cancelled, but within 10 minutes we were moved to the direct AB-flight CTA-DUS. Even better. So we had two punctual flights, with a friendly crew and reasonably priced drinks. Leg room was awful however. I like the small route screens on Air Berlin aircraft. But it's all over since Air Berlin stops flying in a few days, so no recommendation. Pity, because Air Berlin was one of my favourite airlines. Never had any problems.",,,,,
"  Milan to New York return via Dusseldorf. I had a very positive experience with AirBerlin - on all four of our flights. The prices were phenomenal - all four of us flew economy roundtrip for less $2,200 - although they did charge me quite a bit for seat reservations - with 2 small kids, you can't really make a good case for 'oh honey sorry you get to sit to that stranger."" Everything ran on time. The seats are as about tight as most US airlines - though not as bad as United's back rows. But we fit fine, video was working (with lots of options for watching), food was ok-ishand the attendants were quite helpful and very nice. Really, I have no complaints. And yes, I did check in luggage on the way back - because who doesn't overshop in Italy? - and I got them back in NYC. We were all nervous about this due to all the bad review of lost luggage. In fact it is why I am writing the review - as I promised myself I would write a good review if we arrived home intact with a good experience. I fly Business for work - I was expecting worse but was very pleased as were my husband two kids (8, 10)",,,,,
"  Berlin to Prague. Worst experience I’ve had for a while! They announce 2 hour delay, then no info until we understand that once they have a plane they must wait for a new crew. Very bad organisation and communication. Definitely avoid if you can, lost my time and couldn’t make my meetings.",,,,,
"  Frankfurt to Berlin, our first flight was cancelled but they arranged me other flight. Next day I use Air Berlin also this time their service was on time and good service and cabin crew - they are very friendly and helpful. I was very happy their service.",,,,,
  Berlin to Warsaw. This is worst experience I had. Staff are really rude. They don't have enough information about flight. I had three different information last 10 minutes. I have been waiting for my flight over 2 hours and flight is delayed. And Airberlin's staff still can't give any information about flight.  I don't recommend it at all.,,,,,
"  Worst airline ever, poor customer care. Representatives are rude and not helpful. My flight from San Francisco to Prague (with only one connection stop) was cancelled without any notification and explanation as to why. Air Berlin representative was not helpful at all. We were told that we would be flying via a different airline, however, didn't give any information regarding flight number, refused to print any documents proving that we had the new flight with a different airline. In addition, they gave us a flight with two stops (we could have find tickets much cheaper with two stops). Do not recommend this airline, they just lost two customers. On my way back another Air Berlin representative was extremely rude, plus she overcharged us for overweight luggage (we had to pay 100 euros for 27 kg luggage). On the board they didn't offer any drinks (water or coffee) from Prague to Berlin.",,,,,
  Bonn to Prague via Berlin. Absolutely bad experience. I bought flight at 5pm from Berlin and instead they put me on flight at 9pm. Nobody was able to explain me why. After staying in line for almost an hour to actually talk with someone they tell me that I have flight for today so they don't understand why is my problem - if they would tell me up front that the flight at 5pm will not happen I would fly directly from Bonn to Prague at 7 pm. These people are cheating their customers.,,,,,
"  Helsinki to Berlin return.  the terminal in Berlin looks like an abandoned warehouse. The Boeing 737 had the A320 safety sheet. The seats were leather, and quite worn out. The flight left TXL on time. I am an Emerald member on one world however they did not recognise me on this flight nor the departing flight (no greeting, benefit, drinks, nothing). They charge 2.5 Euros for a cup of tea and the inflight entertainment via wifi must be purchased. Not recommended as they are pricier than budget airlines. ",,,,,
"  Berlin to Geneva via Dusseldorf. Not a good first impression. First segment no order to boarding process just one long line regardless if your seat assignment. Delayed 30 minutes announced 10 minutes before scheduled boarding time. No explanation why. Onboard, the least amount of legroom I have ever experienced. Take off was finally one hour later. Second flight delayed 35 minutes to late arrival of the aircraft.",,,,,
"  Unfortunately Air Berlin has gone broke, but they are still flying. I was a bit apprehensive because of the insolvency and the bad performance earlier this year, but despite the situation it was great: very punctual - even half an hour earlier on the inbound flight, nice crew and comfortable planes. Since Münster/Osnabrück is a small airport, one is at the gate within 5 mins of entering the building and boarding is very quick. On both flights we had an Air Berlin plane, a Niki flightnumber and a TUIfly crew. B737 showed its age but was fine. Paid 7 euros for a currywurst. A bit steep but it was excellent. Nice flight over Cologne and Lake Geneva with view of the Alps. I was out of Palma airport within 20 mins after touch down (only hand luggage) which was very good for such a big airport. Big surpise on the inbound flight: I was assigned an emergency seat for free. The normal cost is 25 euros, so this was very comfortable. We even got the famous AB chocolate heart at leaving the plane. It's a pity AB is about to disappear. I have flown quite a lot with them and it was always fine. The only reason I don't recommend them is the insolvency, because they're suspending flights already.",,,,,
" Disaster! Booked end March to fly from Stockholm to Geneva via Dusseldorf with my wife and 3 children, taking around 4 hours and thought I had a bargain. 6 weeks before departure was informed of a small change - had to leave 4 hours earlier to fly Stockholm - Berlin - Dusseldorf - Geneva, ie total journey time of 8 hours with children of 4, 6 and 8 years old. Immediately contacted Air Berlin who confirmed I could cancel if wanted (but by then flight prices had doubled) or else I would receive some confirmation if I contacted them via their website. Did this immediately and still haven't heard. Tried contacting them at the airport en route, but impossible to find an Air Berlin employee at the airport, only representatives from other companies who were shocked and sorry but weren't ""able to do anything"". Clear case of profit over customer but if you don't take care of the customer, then somebody else will and next time we will definitely not be flying with Air Berlin.",,,,,
"  New York to Rome via Dusseldorf. We understand travel issues but AirBerlin was most disturbing and we still have not gotten through to any representative over 30 days later. Air Berlin has no customer service line for current customers only a ""ticket booking line"". And the representatives there will quickly and rudely tell you they cannot help you at all. This company has made itself inaccessible to its customers. We could only get bits of information through their affliate airline Alitalia. Basically though Alitaila said that it was AirBerlin we needed to get to to find baggage that had been lost with no trace for 4+days but then their is no way to reach Air Berlin - just email- to date we have and continue to send 40+ emails with no more than the automated reply that the message was received in return. There were multiple other details and issues (being told kmisinformation and waiting at airports only to find out the baggage was in fact still lost). But the biggest issue is Air Berlin's failure to respond to any messages or any emails-we have looked and tried multiple emails with no response.",,,,,
  Boston to Munich via Dusseldorf. This trip was the worst out of all and I was very disappointed with Air Berlin. I was traveling with one other person and her bag was lost and not returned for another week after it was found. She tried to call the company multiple times and it was nearly impossible to get a hold of someone to talk to. The flight attendants on our flight were also downright rude. I am a very easy going person and not much bothers me but they way they spoke to us and handled any problems was highly unprofessional. Trying to board the plane alone was an absolute mess. I would not recommend this airline to anyone looking to fly to Europe.,,,,,
"  Flying from VIE to Westerland, Sylt your options are limited as Air Berlin is the only airline with an acceptable layover. As a Star Alliance Gold member I would clearly prefer LH but the routing would require a overnight stay in MUC - so not a plausible alternative. Well, the routing is the only positive thing about AB - everything else is dreadful. The seats are cramped to the limit, the service is no-frill and literally non-existent, the staff lack friendliness and experience, etc. This was definitely my last attempt on AB. The next time I would rather take the train from Hamburg. ",,,,,
  This was the first trip I tried Air Berlin's (then) new business class service for Europe. I was really pleasantly surprised. This is in my view a much better product than LH or the likes offer. I like that you can get any food or snacks you want from their trolley at no extra charge. This is much better than getting a pre-set tray with food you have no idea what it is. Air Berlin also had very nice hot towels. Their staff really like what they do. The only minus is that they are expensive.,,,,,
"  This is an average budget carrier, and certainly not anything close to a full service airline. Flight to Milan was approximately 30 minutes late leaving Berlin, not even water was offered for free while inflight (would have preferred free water to the chocolate heart they offer upon existing the aircraft), and the luggage took painfully long to reach the belt on arrival. I would consider them again if the ticket is cheap and the duration of the flight is short.",,,,,
"  Berlin to Copenhagen. Worst airline ever. They just lost me and my friend as customers! We booked (two fairly expansive tickets, 390€) 3 months ago and when we came to the check in we are told we are on stand by due to overbooking. We didn't get any information before hand. Not any texts or emails. We were randomly picked and we were not the last ones to check in, we were actually early. I don't know why they chose us because the man behind the desk didn't answer any of our questions and he was rude and just wanted to get rid of us. So now we're sittning here at Tegel Airport and we have to wait 5 hours until the next flight leaves. Great times.",,,,,
"  Berlin to Copenhagen on an Airbus A320. Quality was decent for a budget carrier. Check-in staff did the job, but the counters of Air Berlin on TXL were understaffed. There were issues with getting the aircraft prepared on time. The aircraft was bare and just ""the norm."" Seats were alright for the short flight. There was no cabin service or beverages, but given that this was a short haul flight on a budget carrier it was understandable. Recommended only if you are really on a budget. I would take SAS if I was to do this again.",,,,,
"  Air Berlin is by far the worst airline I have ever flown on. They are always delayed, and for my flight from Berlin to Vienna they didn't even post it on the screens. I can't think of any positive over other airlines. They are not the cheapest and do not offer good quality. This airline fails on every aspect of being an airline. Will never fly with them again.",,,,,
"  Flew Berlin to Munich. Delays and problems with handling luggage is not addressed here since this might be an issue of the airports. Nevertheless it is unbelievable what Air Berlin delivers to its customers. 1) The system delivers a seat which cannot be changed - if you are about 6'3"" it's a real pleasure to have a middle seat. 2) Air Berlin might have economic problems but that does not mean they must give cheapen their ""customer-relationship"". I am German and so try to use German Airlines but AB is a shame. ",,,,,
"  Berlin Tegel to Prague. Never ever will I fly with Air Berlin again, everything seemed nice and smooth from the check in to checking in our baggage but once we landed and we went to collect our checked in baggage we where hit with a shock! Half the flight was missing their baggage (mind you this aircraft had only 70 people on board) ground crew in the Prague told us they always do this and were not surprised. They believe that the bags were still in Berlin and sometimes take weeks to arrive. Now I understand these things happen so I left it and waited no one ever gets in touch with you, I tried emailing ofcourse there was no response. Tried calling the numbers on the website of course they didn't exist. You are better off catching trains around Europe or find proper a airline because these guys are a joke!",,,,,
"  Vienna to Krakow via Berlin Tegel. One week. 4 Air Berlin flights, 3 delayed and to close the story a lost luggage for 26 hours. You book Air Berlin, but you fly Alitalia, where they speak Italian in a route between Vienna and Berlin. Or worse you fly with Air One, which supposedly ceased operations in 2014. It's all very confusing. The phones lines both Air Berlin and Berlin Tegel airport are not available all day. Nobody is answering your emails and you don't receive information where or when your luggage will be delivered. Bad, bad, bad.",,,,,
"  Budapest to Reykjavik via Berlin. Probably the worst airline experience. The worst customer service, nobody able to help you anyhow on their hotline and when you write them through their web form, they don't respond. Lost all 4 of our check-in baggage, which arrived 4 days after us. I called/wrote them several times asking how should we handle the lost baggage, I've got a serious reply the 11th day of our 12 day holiday. Except that we flew our first flight with some old Italian plane and crew (should have been Air Berlin), leg space was really small, 3h 30 min flight without anything to drink.",,,,,
"  Copenhagen to Berlin. Terrible customer experience I have had delayed luggage before and realize it is a risk of flying. My partner and I both had our bags not show up on a direct flight from Copenhagen to Berlin (1 hour flight) and it took 3 and 4 days respectively to get our bags. The issue was not the delayed bags but the complete lack of proper communication which could have addressed our concerns and stress. On our flight, at least a dozen people had same issue. No representative present, no informative communication. Automated messages saying no updates were not effective. No number to reach a person. I called numerous times the number I located and emailed and no answer ever at number and email was simply automated with no information. When I finally received an update that my luggage had arrived in Berlin, I asked to confirm where to pick up to ensure they did not deliver to hotel I was leaving at, and never any reply over several hours. I showed up at Berlin baggage service centre on way out of city and they could not locate. I went to the air Berlin business class counter and the woman staffing refused to help and had zero empathy and was rude. I asked for her manager who had same lack of empathy. I asked to speak to her manager and he was finally the first person who tried to help and brought a luggage person who tried as well. But by this point I had lost my patience with air Berlin. They could not locate my luggage. Finally an hour before I left the city - four days after arriving - my luggage was located at the baggage service centre. I still have not received any apology for air Berlin nor any information on delayed flight compensation process and forms. After reading these reviews it is clear it is an airline issue much larger than my own experiences.  All air Berlin had to do was provide simply updates each day with facts: ""your luggage has not left Berlin, we are trying to get it to you by ddmmyy."" And I would have been fine however the lack of any human being reachable and the lack of empathy by their business class check in counter and her manager mean I will never fly them again. ",,,,,
"  New York to Bologna via Dusseldorf, July 3rd 2017. The departure time at JFK was 9:40pm (Flight No. 7481). I was at the check-in point with plenty of time (7:00pm.) The flight attendant told me ""there is a 3-hour delay because a baby got sick on the plane and they had to land."" She told me not to worry my connecting flight layover was 3.5 hours so I would have made it and they would have made up some time during the flight. At the gate I was told they had to change my connecting flight to Bologna to a later flight at 8:30pm instead of 2:55pm (a serious problem for me), but they told me that they only did that as a precaution in case I cannot make it to the original flight (at 2:55pm) which is what I had booked. The attendant at the gate told me that once in Dusseldorf I would have been able to take the Flight 8686 at 2:55pm. We boarded at 12:45am with more than 3 hours delay. We finally took off and on board I asked what I should do once in Dusseldorf. They said as soon as outside the aircraft look for the information point with Air Berlin attendants and they would have told me where to go to get to the original flight 8686. The flight attendant sent me to Gate B56 and warned me to ""hurry"" because the flight was departing in less than an hour. I ran to Gate B56 only to find no one there. I went to another attendant who told me that Flight AB 8686 was at Gate 44 two floors down. I ran again with a heavy backpack and a carry-on. I had to stop to catch my breath and I felt dizzy. Two police officers saw me and asked me if I was OK. I had to explain what happened to them because they were concern about my health. I finally made it to Gate B44. The Flight 8686 also departed with about 15 minutes delay. On board,  I had to pay for coffee €2.50 for a regular coffee.  At that point I only wanted to get to my final destination. We landed in Bologna BLQ about 10 minutes late. There I had the final humiliation: my baggage was missing. I went to Baggage claim and was told that probably my suitcase was moved to a later flight which will land at night around 10:30pm. I filed a complaint form there and they told me they should call me if the baggage arrives and I would have to go back to the airport to pick it up. It is now 9:30pm and on the Air Berlin website there still no information about my baggage. This has been a horrible experience. I will now have to go back to the airport to hopefully pick up my luggage tonight. I'm exhausted and outraged by Air Berlin.",,,,,
  Warsaw to Abu Dhabi via Berlin Tegel. This airline has awful customer service when things go wrong. On June 30 our 21.50 flight transfer to Abu dhabi got cancelled until 16.00hr the following day but it actually took off even later by 2 hours. My wife and I arrived in Abu Dhabi 20 hours late minus our checked in cases. We filed a lost luggage report. We filed 2 complaints on Air Berlins site and tried to find out luggage on their tracer but nothing seems to work. The number they gave us didn't work and the pir number finds no match. We know our luggage is sitting in a store in Berlin. We've sent the baggage tags which the checkin should have changed for the delayed flight to Abu Dhabi but they told us to keep the old ones. We have been trying for days to contact Air Berlin to no avail as have Etihad their partner from Abu Dhabi. No contact at all. I've set up a facebook group to share their tales of woe and Air Berlin threatened to block me on their social media for doing so. Inflight service is fine but their ground staff and customer service are the worst I've encountered in hundreds of flights with different airlines. They've lost my custom and my wife's.,,,,,
"  
I travel very frequently for business and pleasure to Europe and this is by far the worst airline service I experienced within the past 10-15 years. The aircraft servicing flight from Chicago to Berlin was very old, seats did not recline, majority of TV screens did not work, despite the crews effort to reboot the audio system. Normally, obstacles like this wouldn't impact me, but traveling with kids makes a big difference (try to explain to your child he won't be able to recline the seat or use TV on 9 hrs flight). Lastly, and most importantly, Air Berlin lost our luggage. There were about 30 + other passengers flying on the same flight who reported missing luggage. It is been a week and we did not hear back from the airline. We sent about 11 emails to different departments with copies of claim, lost baggage tags, etc. No response. Furthermore, none of the telephone numbers provided on the website are working numbers. I do not recommend this airline and certainly will not consider it for any future travel.",,,,,
" Air Berlin is by far the worst airline I have ever flown on. They are always delayed, and for my flight from Berlin to Stockholm they didn't even post it on the screens. I can't think of any positive over other airlines. They are not the cheapest and do not offer good quality. This airline fails on every aspect of being an airline. Will never fly with them again.

"  
We traveled from Düsseldorf to Milano Linate with Air Berlin. The service on board of the Airbus aircraft was good. They offered a drink and a sweet or salty snack for free. Furthermore we recieved a chocolate heart. The biggest downside of this flight was the delay of 2.5 hours, due to this we lost a lot of time which we wanted to spend in Italy. The seats were comfortable and the leg space was also reasonable. The cabin crew was friendly and highly motivated.",,,,,
"  I flew round trip from Boston to Stockholm. Extremely disappointed with Air Berlin. When I checked in at Boston airport and I was told that one of my connecting flights did not exist any more. I never received an advance notice making me aware of this. Instead of 2 flights, I had 3. The new flights were booked too close to each other. We barely made the flights, but our luggage didn't make it to our final destination. Our new flight back also required 3 flights, all extremely close to each other. I called customer service to see if they could change us to a better route. I was assured that since we were flying Air Berlin the entire way, our luggage and we would make it to our final destination together. (We were shuffled to another airline on our way over.) Unfortunately, all of our returning flights departed late and our luggage was lost a second time. Also, two out of three flights back didn't have soap in the restrooms. That wouldn't have been a big deal on its own, but just added to our list of frustrations with Air Berlin. I will not be flying with them again.

"  This was my first time flying with Air Berlin on a trip from Chicago to Salzburg and a return flight from Prague to Chicago. It was the worst airline experience I have had in about 20 years of frequent flying. Here are some key reasons: Customer Service is non-existent. No one ever answers their phone number and their online service always returns an error message. I tried for two weeks both online and on telephone with one simple request, to upgrade my seat on my return flight (in other words, pay them more money!). One night, with Expedia on the line with me, we waited on hold for 95 minutes and I finally fell asleep at 1am. Also, with one exception on return flight, every single Air Berlin person I dealt with was not only extremely poor at customer service, but even rude. One flight attendant was just mean to the person in front of me who asked if they could give them their trash. Another flight attendant was rude when I asked a simple question at the counter. Another in baggage claim area in Berlin was rude. Their seats in economy are smaller than any other airline seat I have experienced. I had an eight hour flight with the seat back in front of me literally 10 inches from my face. I am 5 feet 5 inches and my knees hit the seat in front of me the whole time. Be aware they will charge you $60-100 extra just to pick a seat - any seat, including economy - in advance of your flight. The WIFI does not work. I paid for WiFi going over and back and was never able to get on it. The flight attendants were no help whatsoever and were again rude when I inquired The worst part was that I experienced two delayed flights - one from Berlin to Salzburg and one from Berlin to Chicago. Both were handled terribly. When I arrived late in Chicago to make my connection to MSP, I literally ran to the gate and got there in time to get on the flight, but Air Berlin without my consent or knowledge had changed my flight to a flight 4 hours later instead and American Airlines would not let me get on my original flight. When I called Air Berlin to complain about this while sitting in ORD for 4 hours, I again waited on hold for 2 hours and finally decided they did not deserve any more of my time or effort in giving them feedback. They probably won't even read this or care, but I wanted to alert other travelers - avoid this airline!

"  I fly a lot, actually I'm one of those who commute every week. I find its hard to say I will never fly this airline again as: 1) I have to be flexible with the availability and 2) it would probably delete all options as there will most likely be unfortunate circumstances one time or another. Air Berlin is in a league of its own. The flights are usually delayed out of Budapest and not that its great, but its doable. But what I don't get is the incredible lack of communication. No one informs the 20 some passengers that the connecting flight will be there waiting. They don't at all care about the stress the passengers are in. Side note: If you are unlucky to be parked in another terminal (20 minutes left to your departure), they will not take any effort whatsoever in informing you where to go or even update the screens signalling delays. Then you're hit with a one lane open security control, again they don't care if the flight you're about to take is leaving in 5 minutes its slow. Yesterdays flight, once we got in the bus, the driver hacked this thing causing most of us to almost fall over and then once out of the bus, they refused to open the doors cause there was another group let in from another plane in the connecting terminal. Now we were running extremely late and running to the gate. All gates had the destinations show on the screen as is usually the case, except for the one going to Stockholm, so we ran up and asked and were brushed off. They tell us to go outside and what do we find? A bus parked right by the gate a plane right in front of us and one far to the right and again, nothing is marked. I mean, when you fly Ryanair or Wizz Air or any of these cheepy ones, its all marked. Why is this so difficult to figure out? Well obviously it is not, it is due to the lack of care. They think their passengers are a painful must. No communication whatsoever. All this anxiety and stress for the passengers, especially when you're taking the last flight out is unnecessary. Last time I flew them, my luggage got stuck in Berlin for 4 days. I have one more ticket in my pre-purchased pile and then that's it. Never again. All the issues with Air Berlin could be mitigated with care and communication. But I guess they have so many they don't have to worry about it.",,,,,
"  Boston to Copenhagen via Dusseldorf. Excellent outbound flight with efficient and personal service by cabine crew. Seamless transfer in Düsseldorf. Return flight with same route. Delayed departure but on time arrival. Outstanding purser but desinterested and demotivated cabin crew, at least mine. Counterpart had to check all passengers in biz class while the one assigned to me sat in one of the passengers seats for the last part of the flight. Overall, I would recommend this business class, good service with reasonable prices.",,,,,
"  Orlando to Munich via Düsseldorf. The worst airline ever. Going back to Orlando, they first delayed by an hour, then an additional half hour, before I knew what was happening, 4 hours later and still at the gate. The staff was unprofessional, they seemed annoyed at customers asking them about the delays. ",,,,,
 Overall a great service from Berlin to Chicago with Air Berlin. Full recline seats. Purser took much care. The meals where in very good quality and served in a good way. Wine corresponded perfectly. The entertainment could be a little more extensive and the remote was a little cumbersome. But overall service was great!,,,,,
"  San Francisco to Berlin was good, attentive staff. The arrival in Berlin was dismal.  Baggage was slow even with ""priority"", the plane lands and a bus takes you to the terminal. The trip from Berlin to Paris, scheduled for noon or so was resceduled to 6pm for unknown reasons since they don't tell you, so I requested and got a flight for the next day. Arriving at the same terminal, the route to the gate was up 30 feet of stairs, into an upstairs tunnel, down 30 feet back to the terminal without conveniences but lots of duty tree. Then back into a bus, carry bags onto the plane this time with bags because I assume luggage service at CDG equally bad. They need a better terminal! ",,,,,
"  Berlin to Frankfurt. I have used Air Berlin for the first time and the last time. They overbooked the 8.50am flight, AB6577, flying from Berlin to Frankfurt by 10 seats. They bumped us and told us they could not book us another flight the same day. They offered us a 2nd class train ticket and told us to take a bus to the train station. They did not offer to pay for a hotel if we flew out the next day. Overall the personnel were matter of fact. ""This is our company policy. Take it or leave it. But don't make me repeat it."" I don't know how airlines can get away with selling seats multiple times. It's not worth it to fly Air Berlin to save a couple of Euros. Next time we choose an airline that knows what quality service is.",,,,,
"  Paris to Krakow via Berlin. On May 19 my partner and myself were supposed to flight Air Berlin from Paris to Krakow via Berlin with a first flight leaving Paris at 3pm and an arrival in Krakow scheduled at 6.40 pm. The initial flight has been delayed by nearly 2 hours and we missed the connection. Nothing has been arranged to put us on another of the Air Berlin flights to Krakow on the evening the same day or early morning the next day. When we arrived at Berlin around 6pm we had to queue for 2 hours and 45 mns at the Company desk, where finally at 9.30 pm we were placed on a flight to Stuttgart at 8.20 am the next day with a connecting flight there. We arrived at 6.20 am at the Airport on the 20, to discover that our flight to Stuttgart had been cancelled! There was an earlier flight to Stuttgart but they refused to take us while they had vacant seats! We had then again to queue two hours at Air Berlin desk and finally got bookings for flights to Krakow via Munich leaving Berlin at 7 pm. We arrived in Krakow at 11.05 pm the 20th May, thus 32 hours after the scheduled departure from Paris. And to add insult to injury, it is impossible to get from the Company reimbursement of the expenses I had to bear during this unexpected stop of 24h in Berlin! This company is a shame!",,,,,
  Flight from Berlin to Paris was delayed 1.30 hour. I only received a bottle of water and 2 cheap biscuits as compensation although I missed my last train and therefore had to pay €50 for a cab. First time I booked Air Berlin but won't recommend to anyone.,,,,,
"  Took this overnight flight as a codeshare with Etihad Airways. My partner and I chose to upgrade ourselves to the XL seats which is like the Premium Economy with an increased legroom and seat pitch compared to the normal Economy seats for a price of EUR77. Very pleasantly surprised with the the entire journey. New plane, great cabin crew, good entertainment and comfortable seats. Being at the front of the plane meant that there was ease in getting out and coming in and the XL seats around us were empty despite economy being full. Cabin crew offered to sell these seats to the economy passengers but only 1 was taken up. Seating arrangements were 2-4-2 and as soon as the plane took off my partner got to sit at the 4 empty rows next to us. Food was good but a little small. Overnight flight felt so short and a part of me wished it was a little longer so I could have a longer snooze. All in all would recommend this airline to others and suggest upgrading to the XL seats.",,,,,
"  Zurich to New York return via Berlin Tegel in Business Class. This was an amazing experience and everything went according to plan. The crews were friendly and professional. I am a Star Gold as well as a One World Emerald member and in my opinion Air Berlin and Etihad are ahead of the competition with their personalized service concept in business class (no lights on for two hours after take off and then again two hours before landing and a personalized inflight service concept, on demand with no disturbing factors. An outstanding product with just 19 seats in business class. I could also use the AA first class lounge at JFK which is new and amazing. I would strongly recommend Air Berlin.",,,,,
"  Berlin TXL to Frankfurt. Air Berlin has trouble with basic services and staff appears to be trained to deceive customer support requests. Flight AB6601 on 19 May cancelled without reason along with several other Air Berlin flights departing from Berlin TXL on that evening. No offer of compensation, no answers to calls, unfriendly and unhelpful staff at all counters. Due to the masses of people and the chaos at TXL at that time, checked-in baggage could not be reclaimed on that day. I had another flight in the morning next day from Frankfurt to Taiwan, which thanks to Lufthansa I was able to catch. My baggage is gone since even though I never even entered an Air Berlin plane but only checked-in. I cannot reach anybody at Air Berlin, emails remain unanswered. ",,,,,
  Düsseldorf to Boston. Never fly this airline. The worst by far. They cancel flight and move people to different flights with different destinations. Then you are on your own. You have to buy new ticket to wherever your destination is. They hassle you to collect what you paid. No apologies or regret in their actions.,,,,,
"  New York JFK to Berlin Tegel. My first experience with Air Berlin and quite impressed. While there were delays with boarding at JFK and it took an hour for baggage to be delivered to the belt in TXL with no explanation from ground staff, inflight they were very good. Comfortable seat, nice food, acceptable wine list and extremely friendly and service orientated crew. For the short hop across the pond and direct into Berlin I'd choose them again. Had I not checked bags and had the significant delay with baggage delivery in TXL, this flight would have been seamless.",,,,,
"  Munich to Stockholm via Dusseldorf. Horrible service (lengthy information on our flight in German, a very short in English, I did recognise Stockholm so I assumed the we might miss our connection). At airport no information on flight being delayed, no one in boarding booth, Lady in next booth didn't speak English. Stewardess spoke German and unintelligible English, never got a chance to buy a sandwich on either flights, never offered free coffee. I will never fly with airberlin again. I much more prefer Norwegian, great price with professional service (I fly regularly to UK with them).",,,,,
"  Frankfurt to Berlin Tegel AB6588 is cancelled. Firstly they asked to wait for 2 more hours and then cancelled. The worst airline, terrible! I'm staying in a huge line to get my money back. Can't say anything about their service - I haven't got on board.",,,,,
"  Berlin to Abu Dhabi. The flight had a slight delay, but nothing serious. We had a remote gate and walked like 50m to the parking spot of the plane. I like the 2-4-2 configuration, because we travelled as a group of 2. We had a window and an aisle seat. The seat width is good, but the seat pitch was poor. I am 1,82m and my knees touched the seat in front of me. It is not as abd as on other airlines but it could be better. I couldn't sleep on this flight at all. But the rest of the fight was enjoyable. We had a very friendly and attentive stewardess and the food was delicious. One of the IFE screens across the row stopped working and one member of the cabin crew changed it immediately. All in all I would fly Air Berlin again, if there is no better alternative.",,,,,
" Copenhagen to Munich via Dusseldorf. I've just been swindled by Air Berlin. When I booked the trip, I was given one piece of baggage in the fare. When I called them to add a second piece they charged me $101 for it. I was stunned. I was expecting $25 - $35 perhaps for the second bag. They even sent me an email advertising extra baggage for 10 Euros if I booked it more than 30 hours out. That's a laugh. They must be into false advertising. Maybe I'm living in an unrealistic world, but with high status on United, I get two free bags on Lufthansa every time I use them and could have flown them more cheaply had I known about the excessive baggage fees. Moreover, I'm flying Air Berlin and Flybe to London City airport a few days later. They told me that I have to book my baggage at the airport because of the interline ticket, which is bound to be even more expensive. I will never fly Air Berlin again.",,,,,
  I traveled from New York to Warsaw in April 2017. Returning from New York was delayed two hours so I missed the connecting flight to Warsaw. Air Berlin put us on a flight to Amsterdam and on another flight from Amsterdam to Warsaw. On top of that my luggage was lost and I had to wait three hours for it to arrive.  Air Berlin get on the ball. Never have I seen such incompetent and disorganized airline. Never again will I fly Air Berlin.,,,,,
"  Bucharest to Miami vis Sibiu, Munich. My worst experience with an airline so far. 3 weeks before departure, they changed dates and hours - technically I could choose to get my money back, but buying from another company with such short notice would have been much more expensive - what I paid for was Bucharest to Miami with one stop, what I got was the same with 3 stops - what I paid for was Miami to Bucharest with one stop, what I got was the same with 2 stops. I had to book a hotel room for one night in Berlin because the flights were not in the same day after the change they made (still waiting for a refund), and they failed to deliver the luggage in Miami. It arrived after 2 days - out of 4 Air Berlin flights, 3 were delayed by approx 1 hour each. AirBerlin call-center is bad. They say on the web-site is 24h, but that's not true. If you call them when they don't work, they don't say come back at operating hours. They just let you listen to bad music indefinitely on your own expense. and when they do answer, they even give incorrect answers (like saying Bucharest to Munich is a direct flight, which was certainly not.",,,,,
"  Frankfurt to Palma de Mallorca. Reserved seat was ignored, it looks not unusual. My family booked 4 seat together beforehand in website. But boading pass we got in airport forced us to seat far location each other. One lady kindly changed her seat for my son 8 years old to my next seat. She was forced to seat separately with her husband instead. My wife and daughter 11 years old are forced to seat one by one separately. ",,,,,
"  I recently flew from Bangkok to Warsaw with Etihad. No problems with the Etihad flight but they code share with Air Berlin for the Abu Dhabi to Berlin leg and again Air Berlin on the Berlin to Warsaw leg. The fun began when I was informed my Berlin to Warsaw flight was cancelled resulting in me hanging around for hours for the next flight - ok that's a pain but not the end of the world. What happened next just proved to me how useless Air Berlin are. Having arrived in Warsaw I then found out they had lost all of my 3 bags, the handling company in Warsaw could tell me nothing because they rely on Air Berlin for information and I was one of over 100 people who had the same problem . I tried to get information on what was going on but you can not - there is no telephone no to speak to someone just a website that tells you they are looking for the bags, which is just frustrating not helpful. After 4 days of wearing the same clothes all my bags were found but no offer of an apology or compensation for me having to spend 4 days with no clothes to change and no toiletries to freshen up.

"  Prague to Berlin. The worst customer service I have experienced in 30 years of global travel. I and thousand of other had their luggage lost at Tegel airport this easter weekend. No customer service. You are directed to WISAG who they have outsource the baggage handling to. All WISAG does is direct you to a iPad and make you file your own report. Huge line up, hours long, only one clerk. They never email you to tell you the status of your baggage, they never answer the phone numbers given, they never answer the emails sent. It's been 4 days zero response. Called the Air Berlin reservation number and they say call WISAG. WISAG is totally non responsive. So basically Air Berlin says we don't care not our problem it is your problem. Destroyed my easter weekend. Flying home without luggage. Only shopping day during the holiday was Saturday which I spent replacing cloths. Air Berlin has provided a shameful lack of service. I read they delayed there long haul flights because they have a new company handling their luggage. They have been on the job since March 26 and they are even more useless than the old company. T",,,,,
"  New York JFK to Duesseldorf. The worst service in a business class cabin I've received. There was nothing that I could say positive about this flight 7481 of Air Berlin departing April 8 from JFK to Dusseldorf. Arrived at JFK with more than 3 hours in advance. There were people in the priority /business line waiting because the two staff that attended the site, were gone for a break , and no other attendance paid attention to us. Suddenly another travelers that arrived after us were allowed to go through, and when I complained, a very young man responded that they were attending first the Berlin passengers (was no way this gentleman could know, without asking, whether I was going also to Berlin?) When we arrived at the time of boarding (we were told at the counter that there was going to be a 25 minutes delay), we had to wait for an hour without anybody explaining what was going on. We later found out that they had to switch the aircraft, and make the catering. When we finally boarded, never were we were approached by our names, I had to wear my jacket, since nobody came to ask for it. Food (bad catering), but that was not all. My dinner selection was Rissotto with a pinot grigio; the staff brought me the rissotto  with a red wine; when I told her that that was not my wine, and that I order the grigio, I think I spoke in esperanto, since she had no idea what I was talking about: I said white wine, and she said ok, and she never came back with the wine. Tire of waiting, I sipped a horrible red wine, and my wife took it and changed it for a chardonnay she was having. Dessert with the whole tray occupied with the other plates. The cabin was a mess, the flight staff spent the flight running, coming and going, and that is the reason why I did not have the chance to request for some better treatment. My only comfort was that this was a 6 hours flight. At the end, when we were to land the flight attendant asked me to put my jacket back since I couldn't have it in my hands. A business ticket with an economy class treatment.",,,,,
" Tel Aviv to Berlin with Air Berlin. So everything starts in the airport. We arrived at the airport 3 hours before the flight. The check-in staff were really unfriendly and impatient. Told us that the flight was full and we can't move for another seats (we sat near the toilet) but when we arrived at the airplane we saw a lot of free seats. After the takeoff, we were expecting for a little snack or a sandwich but we didn't get anything the whole flight. It's unbelievable because we paid 800$ per ticket. I don't know what's the problem with Air Berlin because it's not the first time I am flying with them. At the past they were an excellent airline. Not recommended.",,,,,
" Went on a round trip Stockholm-Berlin for a long weekend. On the way, the Air Berlin flight was about 30 min late. When landing in Berlin, there were no buses that could take us to the terminal. We were stuck in the plane for about 30 min before any buses came. We are now on the way back to Stockholm, and the latest information says that the flight is 40 min delayed. Just hoping to get home soon. I will not choose Air Berlin again, no matter how cheap the tickets are.",,,,,
"  New York JFK to Berlin. Great service and friendly crew. When I booked, I saw some people reporting bad reviews about them, I was sceptical. I must say I was beyond happy and grateful that I flew with them.",,,,,
"  Abu Dhabi to Berlin. The cabin crew in our section was unfriendly. When asked for milk for my coffee she just waved it, never said a word, no smiles, no response in English. I had the person next to me translate. Nobody looked at passengers when we entered the plane, the crew talked to each other and we were just not greeted with a smile like all other companies I have flown with. I had to make this review, as it was not a good atmosphere, I felt really uncomfortable and it was quite a long flight.",,,,,
"  Flew Air Berlin from Milan to Berlin. Of course, you should not expect lots of comfort here (the seats are quite narrow) and there is no free food, but for a short-range flight it's not that critical. What you get is reduced price and nice Topbonus frequent flyer program which allows to collect miles fast. Once you achieve Silver tier, you can continue buying relatively cheap tickets, but also enjoy free baggage allowance and seat selection.

"  Flew Air Berlin to Vienna for a short business trip: they are the only option from Linate airport and for me it is much better than flying Austrian from Malpensa since I can save half an hour drive to get to MXP. Bought my ticket in December and paid about EUR 180,00 including one checked bag and seat selection. Both flights were perfectly on time, check-in was a breeze, the young cabin crew was polite and professional and and planes clean and modern. More than enough to be satisfied and to declare that I will surely fly them again for short haul flights inside Europe.",,,,,
"  Munich to Warsaw via Berlin. Air Berlin was late about an hour at boarding, at departure 2hrs. In Berlin I had to transfer to connecting flight to Warsaw, which was to depart 30 min before the first flight's late arrival. Hustling off the plane, there was no bus to bring us to the terminal, which literally was 15m away. After 5 min, there was a bus to bring us these 15m. Inside the terminal, I was running to catch the next flight. It took about 5 min, just to notice me boarding the plane right next to the one I came in with. After having seated, we were told that we need to wait for another 30min because one passenger did not show up but his luggage was loaded, so it had to be unloaded. About 2h late departure. Arrived in Warsaw, I was told my luggage did not arrive, because there was too short time in Berlin to transfer my luggage. Air Berlin staff knew this already in Berlin, but decided to tell us upon arrival in Warsaw. However, how was there 30 min to unload luggage but not to load transfer luggage? Being left without christmas presents and without any clothes one day before christmas, I was also told that before 2 days after christmas I cannot really expect my luggage. Thank you Air Berlin for ruining christmas. Never again.",,,,,
"  Berlin Tegel to Bucharest. I would start my review with the regret that Air Berlin has stopped flying to Bucharest and those were one of the last flights operated by them. I know it is tough to keep pace with Ryanair but since Air Berlin has moved towards a quality service experience for its customers, maybe it would have been nice to get this experience on this route too. I must say that since I fly Air Berlin (and that is a lot of time) I only had once or twice that my flight was delayed. And those flights to/from Bucharest were both ahead of schedule. I have read it is not always the case but from my experience and point of view, I was really impressed to see so many flights on time. The aircrafts they are flying are new (I suppose the kept only the new ones in their fleet after the restructuring last year) and as a topbonus platinum I always get a seat with extra leg-room which makes flying with them a joyful experience. There are some things that are disturbing: the inflight entertainment system only shows ads of Air Berlin and their partners together with their destinations, over and over again. This becomes too much after some time and they never change. They have an App which you can use on your own device for WiFi and entertainment, but for my surprise you had to pay for watching TV-Series as well, not only for using the WiFi. They are many airlines which offer this service for free. Another thing that I find not right are the prices for the in-flight snacks and drinks. I understand that this is a new market strategy (is it really part of that high quality experience they are talking about?) but there are operators offering decent prices, not 3,5€ for a mineral water. And the coffee was really bad: a bag exactly like tea infused in hot water. I would expect more quality from their famous ""signature"" coffee. I think things are changing and the airline looks better like it used to be some years ago. The cabin crew members are more friendly but there is still much to do. Many people say it has the corporation mentality and they attention for client is low and that is partially true. I think being closer to the client in any way will make this airline better.",,,,,
"  Berlin to Abu Dhabi. XL seats are good, great leg room and I found the seat very comfortable to sit on. Everything else was quite sad! Crew was cold and except for one flight attendant there were no smiles. None of them seemed happy or enjoying their job. Food was very disappointing, actually shocking how little it can be, and I am not a big eater. It was just an unpleasant flight.",,,,,
"  San Francisco to Munich. I started flying with Air Berlin from Germany to the US for business during a period of strikes by Lufthansa. I did a few flights with them with a few minor problems (delayed flights, delayed luggage); I kept using them as I had already a bunch of miles and a gold status, but the last one was very bad and is the last drop. Connecting in Berlin will require you to change terminals by walking outside and going over security again. Their lounges are so bad that are almost always worse than the comparable regular waiting areas from better airlines. A lot of their web site is not working, specially if you are accesing it from outside of Germany. Their phone app is buggy and of very limited functionality. It is very hard to get hold of them on the phone, you have to navigate a maze of menus to get there and then wait for long periods of time. Their phone service is very fragmented, once I get to talk with someone it often happens that he or she can not do what I need and I need to call again. My average has been four calls to get anything done; this is in total with waiting and menu navigation about 45 minutes. Their phone service is not 24 hours, if you are in a different time zone than Germany you may have to actually wake up in the middle of the night to call. It is practically impossible to make use of miles for flight upgrades in their own flights. It is effectively impossible to use their miles to upgrade or buy any service from other airlines on the network. Booking an award fligh on their own flights requires you to call them, again, this is difficult; you cannot do it online. My last return flight was cancelled and I arrived with a 12 hour delay back home, losing a whole work day; they didn't offer lounge access during my 12 hour wait at the San Francisco airport. Now they are delaying and dragging their feet with lots of bureaucracy to pay the compensation mandated by EU regulations. This is just what I can remember in one go, the list can go on. I definitely do not recommend using Air Berlin.",,,,,
"  The flight from Berlin to Abu Dhabi is supposed to be sold in collaboration with Etihad. However, the experience of Air Berlin is million miles away from what I have experienced on Etihad. The staff use German as their first language of contact all the time - even on the fifth time when I spoke to them, they would still answer in German. They hardly ever smile or keep an eye contact. When the entertainment is switched on, you have to go and ask for the headset. They expect you to bring your own. We took off at 21.30 and received first refreshment 2 hours into the flight - I managed to watch a whole movie before they offer a glass of water. Considering that it's a night flight, they wait with delivering the supper until it's 2 am. Hardly anyone was still awake. Considering the food, they could hardly offer less: three spoons of overcooked pasta with tomato sauce, four crackers and two slices of cheese.  And do not try to ask for another glass of wine - they never look at you. Terrible service and will never fly with them again.",,,,,
"  Stockholm to Düsseldorf return with Air Berlin. This was a cheap trip for me, except for the luggage which was well priced but all in all, a cheap trip. The seats were nice and the seat in front of me did not recline too much leaving me with good space. But then again I am a 1.61m short girl. The crew was not too pleasant or attentive. No help was given with the luggage at all, they just stood there. A girl next to me kept her cabin bag model large in an empty seat next to her during the whole flight, while I was forced to put my soft jacket on the floor under a seat. She could have asked to put it in the compartment for me - I got what I paid for I guess. Air Berlin thank you for taking me to Germany for a reasonable price but no thank you, I will not be a returning customer.

"  Hurghada to Munich. As somebody who flies various times per year I can say that this was the worst flight I've ever been on. First of all the positive : the service was unexpectedly well. On a four hour flight they served alcoholic beverages and some snacks for free what is not usual these days on low cost airlines. The worst part of the whole flight were the cramped seats. I´m 1,98 m tall (6'6ft) tall so I couldn't find any comfortable position. My knees hurt and I didn't have any space to rest my legs. Asked at the check in for a emergency exit row-seat they wanted to charge me 39EUR what is unjustifiable towards clients of my height. So I spent three hours standing in front of the toilets to avoid pain. This was the first and last time I've booked Air Berlin. If they aren´t able to provide decent space or service for tall costumers I see no reason to pay for a flight with them. Wouldn´t recommend it. ",,,,,
"  Rhodes to Paris via Berlin. They made me pay a fee for lugagge (115€). They did not deliver the luggage on time, I had to wait 5 days and call the airport every day. My luggage arrived 5 days later damaged and my kitesurf board that was in the bag as broken. After contacting them for 5 months they still never did anything, they did not even send me a single message or gave me a call. They don't care about their customers.",,,,,
"  It started in New York City and it all ended almost 24 hours later in Florence. The flight from NYC to Dusseldorf was 2 hours late (supposedly for an unspecified “change of equipment”) hence my flight from Dusseldorf to Florence had to be rerouted. Therefore I had to fly from NYC to Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf to Vienna (Austria), then from Vienna to Rome (IT) the from Rome to Florence. 4 flights. My baggage was lost and given to me after 3 days. On my way back, the flight from Florence to Dusseldorf was cancelled therefore I missed my connection flight for NYC. I spent 12 hrs in the airport in Florence without Air Berlin answering to my and all other passengers’ complaints. After 12hrs of waiting they put me on a flight to Rome. Arrived in Rome, they say that hotel rooms are waiting for us. I spent the night in the lobby of a Hilton Hotel with fellow passengers because staff at the hotel said that Air Berlin didn’t email them about our arrival. At 3:30am I went to the airport and boarded a flight to Dusseldorf, then one to Berlin, then one to New York. I got to NYC with a 24hrs delay. An offensive 5 Euros voucher for lunch was given to me.

  Dusseldorf to Los Angeles in Business class. Outstanding experience today. Amazing cabin crew with attention to detail. Great food choices as well and very comfortable seats. Enjoyed the inflight entertainment system as well. Usually fly on Lufthansa or Swiss but Air Berlin is much better in business class in my opinion.,,,,,
"  Stockholm to Chicago. Air Berlin is the worst airline I've had an experience with. I landed in Chicago after four months of studying abroad in Sweden, only to see that myself and my friend didn't have any of our luggage arrive. This was on December 22nd so this clearly affected how our holidays were going to be spent. After calling, and calling, and emailing, they had lost my bag, found it again, lost it in Copenhagen, found it again - finally 6 days later on the 28th I received my bags. I missed a trip for Christmas, giving presents, all of my personal items etc. Air Berlin was rude about the process and I would never recommend flying with them if you have baggage.  Air Berlin get a solid two thumbs down for inconvenience and rudeness.",,,,,
"  Berlin to Chicago. Pretty basic and tired business class product. Terminal at Tegel is little more than a hangar and there's no lounge. You do get a 15 euro voucher for food but that doesn't go very far. You have to walk to the plane. It's not far but it wouldn't have been pleasant if it was raining. Plane was a bit tired, food was adequate and entertainment was ok. Also flew with them economy from Copenhagen to Berlin. Both flights were part of a round the world trip so not sure how they compare cost wise. Suspect they are relatively cheap compared to others. In two minds as to whether I'd fly them again.",,,,,
"  Dusseldorf to Punta Cana. The seating in our plane (AB7446 on Jan 4th 2016) was NOT the one shown on any seating map we could find (not even Air Berlin's). Identical staggered cubicles but inverted window/aisle positions. E.g. second row had 02A (window) and not 02C (aisle), third row had 03C and not 03A and so on. Reason why you won't find my 03C on those maps. Seats are horribly narrow and not long enough in the flat position (I m 184 cm tall, you won't be comfortable lying if you are taller than 170 cm, I tend to think), the reading lamp not usable (light beam never illuminates your book page since there is no flexible support/stem like many airlines offer), and almost no room to put your belongings. Okay for day flight in the seating position. Obviously those seats are not keeping Air Berlin's attractive promises (see their website). They should be changed. These seats are light years away from Qatar Airways Boeing 773-ER's and 772-LR's heavenly comfort). I did not use the IFE unless to track the route. So no idea of IFE's value but it offers a wonderful large screen and terrific high definition for the route tracker. I did not use the connectivity either, unless to charge my tablet battery but there are various sockets available (including USB). Drinks generally OK, real Champagne being an asset. Lunch food was nothing fancy but generally okay, snacks not so okay. Excellent service by highly motivated and attentive flight attendants as well as remarkably professional and kind check-in agent. Amenity kit included slippers, a definite asset as far as hygiene is concerned. Cabin was clean. No separate business class counter during ""night before check-in"" service! Not acceptable in my opinion. My seat and general ratings as well as my recommendation would of course be much better if I were a small tiny person. ",,,,,
"  Vienna to Los Angeles via Dusseldorf. We started our trip from the US very confused. When we booked our tickets we did learn that Air Berlin does not fly in the US and part of our flights were with American Airlines for US domestic. I liked that they did not charge for luggage and our luggage went all the Way to Vienna. Unfortunately one of the pieces of luggage did not make it until 12 hours later which was not too bad. The flight was pleasant, nice, helpful crew and the food was not bad. On the way home none of our 4 checked pieces of luggage came on time. We landed Monday night, and as of Friday we have not received them. It could be a really drawback if we were not home but trying to enjoy our vacation.

"  Flew Air Berlin from Miami to Dusseldorf. Excellent caring, friendly and professional cabin crew. Captain and crew announcements too softly spoken and volume to low. Hard to understand. Food service on sector Duessldorf to Miami was 5 star. Food service Miami to Duesseldorf was 3 1/2 star. Miami joint businessclass lounge excellent. Business club cubicle in comparison to any other airline is overall well designed and functional but far too narrow. Average sized man has shoulders squeezed in, feels like undersized coffin. However I will recommend airline and fly again. Hope next aircraft seat design will improve.

"  ZRH to JFK via DUS in C. Excellent C service and product on both legs as always. Arrival in JFK 20 minutes ahead of schedule. After hundreds of short and longhaul flights in C and F with LH and LX I recently switched to Air Berlin for transatlantic flights after a satus macht from HON to AB Platinum. Really like the AB business product a lot more: 19 C seats only, proper lie flat seats and certainly not with cheap air cushions, no cheap trolleys coming down the aisle but proper restaurant style service with excellent foods and wines, very helpful, friendly and professional crews etc.. Last but not least, it usually only takes me about 10 minutes from the door of the plane to the taxi stand at JFK Terminal 8 wheras it can easily take 2 hours at the other terminals, specifically at the International Terminal 4. Finally, AB platinum status = Oneworld Emerald allows for First Class Lounge access across the entire Oneworld network with all Oneworld carriers as well as Etihad.",,,,,
"  Sofia to Berlin Tegel. Being my airline, as their Platinum member I must say that we do have a really complicated relationship. I fly them a lot inside Europe and the service is really depending on who is in the crew. It can be a delightful experience or it could be a disaster, although I must say that in the last year you can feel some change inside the management and the service is improving and becoming good, therefore I trust them and give them 10 points for the change they are developing. Some might say that paying for the snacks and drinks it is a downside but I do think that for flights shorter then 2h you really don't need all these. The prices they offer are OK and the quality of the products has improved. You still get the chocolate heart when exiting the aircraft. The planes they got after the restructuring are in very good shape. Not mentioning that the flights are almost all the time landing on time or even before schedule. It is still very difficult to use their website in order to buy tickets and this needs improvement. The mobile apps are sometimes too long under maintenance and you cannot use all the features, but at least people are well informed about it. I really hope this airline will get back on track because in my opinion is the best German airline and it brings up the spirit of Berlin (those living in this city probably know what I mean).",,,,,
"  Dusseldorf to Los Angeles. We are talking here about the too much advertised (on all their Europe flights on their entertainment screens) new Air Berlin business class seats which indeed are new, the technology is great, but they are to narrow. I tried to sleep, I couldn't. It was indeed a day flight, so I wasn't probably that tired. I was expecting more from their ""Sansibar"" exclusive menu and the portions could have been more generous and served more often for an almost 12h flight. I got the opportunity to fly business as an upgrade to economy offered by the airline to its frequent flyers' program and I must say it was a good experience after all. Not the best business class I have flown, but a good experience for exchanging miles.",,,,,
"  Air Berlin Topbonus Frequent Flyer Program is an insult to passengers. For my upcoming flight from JFK to Berlin Tegel on Jan 11, 2017 (AB 2749) I tried to redeem miles for a seat reservation for an XL seat. For some reason I could not reach the Topbonus office in Berlin by phone. Constantly got a busy signal. The US booking office could not and would not handle the request either. They, however, sent two e-mail to Berlin to have that office call me back instead. No response. In dismay I requested to speak to the manager of the US office. She was extremely arrogant, refusing to come to the phone letting me know through an intermediary that I should keep calling Berlin. 7 e-mails with my request were not honored either. I got a standardized computer response: ""we will handle your request with utmost care"" and ultimately: ""it can only be handled by phone"". Finally connecting by phone I paid for every minute on hold for my transatlantic call. Nobody got on line in a reasonable time. I gave up willing to lose the miles that expire by end of year. While I find the flights and attendants typically very pleasant, customer service and customer care of the ground service is humiliating and degrading. Very unfortunate for an airline in economic trouble.",,,,,
"  Barcelona to Stockholm via Dusseldorf. Lost luggage, an 8hr delay, zero information, and landed at destination after midnight. Missed connecting train and had to take rental car (based on instructions from Air Berlin staff). I received a 10€ check for meals. Was denied email and phone service. I filed two complaints which was left without reply. Luggage turned up a few days later without notice. Claims for direct costs rejected. Worst customer experience ever.",,,,,
  Venice to JFK via Dusseldorf. Worst customer support ever. Cancel connecting flight with no agents at gate notifying you. Hundreds of passengers left hanging in foreign airport looking for someone to figure out what was going on. Lost luggage and then claimed not their responsibility - it was the problem of airport baggage handlers. Customer service team not able to give Valid email or telephone numbers for assistance. Worst experience ever.,,,,,
"  First time in Business Class on Air Berlin from Chicago to Berlin. Seats are lie flat but quite narrow, and also short on length. In the flat position I had to bend my legs or have feet jammed against the end of the seat. The crew, food and drinks, and onboard service was very good. Would definitely fly them again.",,,,,
" Rome to Curaçao via Düsseldorf with Air Berlin. There's no space in the seats. We're 173 and 183 cm and our legs couldn't fit. After take-off the passenger in front of my husband kept reclining his seat up and down. When we called the steward to ask him for a solution as the man was literally crashing and recrashing on my husband knees he answered us irrespective that he couldn't do much. Result: 8 hours of hell. Food was miserable. We're now waiting for the flight back - at the check-in we asked for a seat with a little of more space and they answered we would have to spend other 84€ each for the seats near the exit. We paid 1000€ each in August to fly in December. I travel often in North, Central and South America with different companies, Air Berlin is the worst.",,,,,
"  Never buy tickets with long haul flights being operated by a partner airlines. I was flying to Munich to Hyderabad via Abu Dhabi, the Munich to Abu Dhabi flight operated by Air Berlin. The service provided by Etihad is very bad if you book with their partner airlines. Etihad does not even care, very rude service. Any question asked to Etihad representatives is met by a rude answer 'ask Air Berlin'. I would have if the Air Berlin counters were present at the transfer desk. ",,,,,
"  Miami to Dusseldorf on Air Berlin. One of the worst flight experiences: the seat is the most squeezed I have flown, similar to EasyJet, but long haul. Service is ordinary befitting a cheap airline. Air Berlin fails to recognize One-World partner Elite Membership for extra seating, which is offered only to their members (while AA offers to partners). Check in staff 'knows nothing' about lounge, but the AA Miami Lounge turned out to be the only good thing on this trip. The fare is cheap but false economy: AA is much better.",,,,,
"  Dusseldorf to Berlin. A short flight, my connection between Miami and Berlin, and as such it should be OK but I am frustrated. I had booked an aisle seat but on boarding I found it changed unnoticed to a middle seat. While the flight is short and endurable, I vow to avoid this nasty airline which has failed in many respects, not befitting the German name for supposedly quality.",,,,,
"  We should have flow from KEF to TXL and then to ZRH but we were diverted to Leipzig as they did not have enough fuel on board to enter into a holding for 20 minutes when we reached Berlin. After two hours we were then taken to Berlin by bus with no rebookings arranged for the connecting flights. I then had to stay in TXL for almost 24 hours as they refused to book me on an earlier flight to Zurich even though they had seat availability in business class. Plus I am also a One World Emerald member. The worst thing about Air Berlin is actually not that things consistently go wrong, but they have a terrrible corporate culture of not caring about their customers.",,,,,
"  I purchased a $3,000 business class ticket from Los Angeles to Düsseldorf. Since I am a professional musician I made sure to speak over the phone with a Air Berlin manager to confirm I would be able to carry my $ 150.000 guitar with me as my only carry on baggage. The Air Berlin manager assured me that following the US Federal law I should not have a problem. When I arrived to the LAX airport, the Air Berlin manager on duty refused to let me carry my guitar on board, she also refused to receive a printed copy of the US Federal law and she even refused my right as a passenger to speak to the senior flight attendant hoping to find a solution. She was simply impolite. If this is the treatment I received as a business class passenger with Platinum status on my Frequent Flyer with Air Berlin's alliance, I can´t imagine what is the general attitude towards the rest of passengers. Air Berlin lost a client. My advice is to let Air Berlin as your last flying carrier option to fly with. You might spend a little more with another carrier but at least you know that the customer service will be there for you for anything you may need for your journey. ",,,,,
"Bought my ticket one day in advance for $122 from Berlin Tegel to Dusseldorf, which was a very good deal. I got to the airport early to check my bag, and the guy told me my fare didn't include a checked bag. Fair enough. He gave me a paper slip and had me go to the ticket sales office to pay. They in turn sent me somewhere that had no sign, so they had to tell me again where to go. After finally being able to complete the transaction, I went and got my bag tag. The agent wasn't friendly and welcoming, only functional. The line to get through security was long and the waiting area tiny, but that's all about Tegel Airport, not Air Berlin. Boarding was fairly haphazard, but they got the job done in time for departure. We took off and landed a bit early with the lights off most of the way to DUS as it was an early morning flight. The flight attendants literally ran the cart through the aisle and sold drinks to maybe 3 passengers. Got my bag at DUS. Mission accomplished, but I wish they had been nicer.",,,,,
"  Venice to Dusseldorf. Air Berlin is average when their operation goes as planned, but at the slightest irregular operation they come apart and it is just chaos! Two years ago, I flew from Budapest to Berlin on a non-stop flight, but my luggage was delayed. I filled out a report at the airport, and didn't hear from them for three days and no one would answer the telephone, so I went back to the airport to learn that they had 500 pieces of baggage on hand and wouldn't let me look for my suitcase and they hadn't even entered my report into their computer! I got my suitcase back 13 days later and they ignored every attempt I made to get my interim expenses reimbursed (they were very modest). I had to travel on to Switzerland for a week without clothes and underwear. On the 19th, their inflight crew was ""illegal"" and so the flight was delayed 90"", and so I missed my train connexion and had to purchase a new ticket for 39€. I asked for a reimbursement, but at least this time they answered and told me NO! It wasn't three hours so I am out of luck, and they had the moxie to write me, ""We sincerely hope that you will accept our apologies and hope that you will continue to place your confidence in us."" The only confidence I have in them is that they will operate their company like a circus. I advise you to make a connexion on a reliable company.",,,,,
"Berlin to Abu Dhabi on return to Australia, on A330 with 2x4x2 seat configuration. Late flight out at 8.55pm with slight delay 20+ minutes on departure from Tegel. Air Berlin offers extended/extra leg room seats for additional cost on this aircraft but not made aware of this till after flight, and not available on codeshare with Etihad, neither is seat selection for this section. Used Air Berlin a number of times and found service and efficiency to be good. We had a good experience with ground staff at Tegel check-in as the Taxi dropped us off at the incorrect terminal, the check-in staff at terminal provided excellent service in checking us onto the flight and arranging second leg seating. This allowed us to walk over to the correct terminal and drop off check luggage only avoiding a reasonable wait at the general check in - big thumbs up to Air Berlin ground staff. Flight was up to expectations and free of any issues or hassles. The service was very good and the food was slightly better than on Etihad, amenities well maintained and refreshments served throughout flight. Overall very good flight and would use and recommend Air Berlin in future.",,,,,
"Flew Air Berlin as a co-share with Etihad out of Abu Dhabi to Berlin. Slightly delayed departure time. AB seat configuration 2 x 4 x 2, with seats 43H-K, Noticeably down grade on this aircraft from the A380, more dated appearance and fitout but well maintained and clean. Seat spacing reduced and generally more cramped feel, seat not particularly great or comfortable but bearable for 7hr flight - would not like to do any longer. Plane was close to capacity. Flight was up to usual German expectations for efficiency and service. I've noticed some general poor reviews for AB but not reflective of our experience (several long-short haul). The service onboard was very good and the food quality slightly better than the Etihad offerings, also noted 2 x meal services on 7 hr flight, which was the same as Etihad for 14hr flight. Cabin amenities well maintained in clean condition throughout the flight. On board entertainment - below other offerings and screen size a little on the small side to the more modern offerings but screen quality still good. Overall trip into Tegal was smooth and hassle free - still love Tegal for its compactness and convenience to CBD. Disappointing to note AB no longer provide their welcome to Berlin chocolate heart (Fassbender & Rauch) on departing the plane - really looked forward to this little parting treat. Would recommend and use this carrier again.",,,,,
"Frankfurt to Berlin. Austerity measures noticeable. To my disappointment, Air Berlin has practically abolished its inflight service on this route - no free beverage, no snack (fortunately, still a good-quality piece of chocolate). Beverages and snacks could be purchased but some of them were not available when asked for. The seats are very cramped. In summary, Air Berlin feels like a low-cost airline now - which it did not in the past. I have to state that flights were on time and flight attendants friendly - with the minimal service there was not much communication, though.",,,,,
"  Stockholm to Berlin. I frequently fly with Air Berlin since a few years back, and have recently noticed a steady decline in the quality of the service. First Air Berlin started charging for baggage, then they wouldn't let you select a seat, and recently they removed the free drinks and snacks. I have not noticed any difference in the prices. Other than this, several other experiences have negatively affected my opinion. Recently my girlfriends bags were lost by Air Berlin (for the second time), and they promised she would get a refund for everything. We even called the support to make sure. However, all she got was a coupon to use when booking flights through the AB website. The value of the coupon was 1/3 of what the clothes cost. As for my personal experiences, a few months ago I missed a connecting flight because of the first flight was delayed. The lady at the service desk told me that I would not get anything because I had more than enough time to make it, eventhough I ran as fast as I could.  As for the positive, the planes are rather clean and the prices are decent. Also Air Berlin flies to TXL.",,,,,
" We booked our trip to Phuket on the Air Berlin website. The segments from Abu Dhabi were operated by Etihad Airways and the rest was operated by Air Berlin. Checked in online, but when we arrived at the airport we found out, that our seats from Abu Dhabi to Phuket had been reassigned to other passengers. Reason was, that Air Berlin can not access the Etihad Airways booking system. Hence our boarding passes were invalid and we did not get any window seats any more. Apart from that however, check in procedures were smooth and seamless. Air Berlin offers their XL seats (economy seats with more legroom) for free to their frequent flyers and I have to say, that I love them. They are exactly what I was looking after. I do not need any premium economy product where the food is the same but only presented differently. I get extra baggage allowance and other benefits from my frequent flyer status. So the extra legroom is really valuable to me. Even if I didn't get it for free, I would be more than willing to pay those 79€. The extra space allows you to stretch your legs and to find comfortable and relaxing position for a long haul flight. Boarding was done in an efficient way and we were able to take off on time. Pillows and blankets were distributed in advance, whereas the amenity kits (toothbrush, sleeping mask, ear plugs) were distributed after we were airborne. Shortly after take off the crew distributed a sandwich and announced, that there will be breakfast prior to our arrival in Berlin. By doing so, the crew was able to maximise sleeping time for their passengers. After snack service, water bottles were given to each passengers and the light was switched off. Breakfast service commenced 90 minutes before arrival The options included an omelette and pancakes. I picked the omelette, which was surprisingly tasty. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience and I can't wait to fly Air Berlin again.",,,,,
" Zurich to Bucharest via Berlin TXL with Air Berlin. Punctual flights, on each leg aisle seats in the front of the airplane as I am Oneworld Emerald FT. Booked the flight a while ago and ordered lunch. This option is not available anymore. Meals also not onboard. Had to claim the money back, which was easy to do and fast with no complication. So far all ok. But I really do not understand their changes of service in the context, that they want to restructure as a smaller network carrier. Why reduce food and drinks to zero? Then the new biz class product (4 seats in the front row). Not even any special menu, but the option that you get what ever you want from the onboard food shop. There is a difference of several hundred Euros to a ""Classic"" fare ticket so if you have no intercontinental connection it's not worth the money. The other thing to observe, is to have plenty of spare money with you, if you want to buy food. CC reader was once not working and they could not change a 50 Euros bill. I like this airline and I'm ok to pay for food if I am hungry but it's definitely their problem to have enough change. I will wait a little until they have made the changes, before I will fly them again.",,,,,
"  The Paris to Berlin flight from Paris Orly was confusing. I thought it departed from Orly West as other One World flights but it actually departs from Orly Sud. The flight was ok. No beverage service, not even a drop of water. Air Berlin fare was cheap and my expectations were low. The good things is that, as a Sapphire member of other carrier, my checked bag fee is waived. So I have reason to be satisfied.",,,,,
"  Flew Air Berlin from Berlin to Miami. My seat, on Row 20, should be 'extra', but it is not (wonder why this is the only Extra row without an extra pitch seat). Fortunately as a Gold card member I didn't pay extra for it. But great that the neighbouring seat is not occupied, though the seat pitch I gather is only some 9 inches, one of the worst. Service was good and there is ample supply of food and beverages at no cost, much better than for example SAS. Not a bad flight The dissatisfaction was only that Air Berlin flight departs from Tegel T3, which is small, congested, and under-equipped. There is no business class lounge, though the flight has business class.",,,,,
"  My trip was from Moscow to Miami via Berlin, they didn't let me to use my ticket because i didn't have schengen visa, but i didn't plan to stay in Germany, I planned to stay in transit, but transit zone doesn't work on night, so... what should do transit passengers? Air Berlin didn't inform about this unique situation, they sold me ticket without any reference on airport's operating hours, almost all international airports are working 24 hours a day, even Heathrow allow transit passengers to leave airport for night, As I didn't use my first ticket, they annulled back ticket and I was not alone in this situation, there was couple who was in similar situation. Never use their service.",,,,,
"  Air Botswana is consistent in letting down their passengers. My family and I have had 4 encounters with Air Botswana and we were let down 4 times. First my mother received an itinerary and a payment confirmation only to arrive at the airport to be told that her ticket was not issued and that she would have to purchase another. She complained about this and Air Botswana tried to calm the situation down stating that she will be reimbursed for the purchase. The second issue was that i had a connecting flight from Johannesburg to Gaborone with air Botswana. My initial flight was from Cape Town. 2hrs before my departure from Cape Town i get informed that the flight from Johannesburg to gabs was cancelled. I was forced to take the flight from Cape Town to Johannesburg but to purchase accommodation for the next day for when air Botswana could give me another flight. I was not reimbursed for the expenses incurred. The third issue is the same as the first which happened to my brother who experienced the same issue as my mother. The fourth issue occurred this morning when I arrived at the check im desk after having travelled 300km on road to get to Gaborone Airport I was inform that although I have a payment confirmation from DPO Pay, Air Botswana had still not received any reflected money in their account and thus would have to purchase another ticket from the ticket sales. This resulted in me having to pay all my travel money and borrowing some to purchase this ticket. I am a student and one can only imagine the difficulty this caused. Air Botswana is consistent in giving trouble and all 4 times my family and I have travelled with them we had problems. When you see this many negative reviews take heed.",,,,,
"  We bought our Maun to Johannesburg in october. At this time the flight departure were at 1:50pm landing in Joburg at 4pm giving us 3h35 to catch our flight for Europe. 3 weeks before our departure I received a notification about this flight. It has been delayed to 3pm and will land in Joburg at 6pm. Leaving us with 1h35 to catch our flight in Joburg. Quite difficult to do but doable. I wrote to customer service to ask them if it will be ok to have such a short transit time in Joburg, but they never answered me. When we arrived in Maun, we told the Air Botswana representative that we had to register on our flight to Europe because we will not have time to do it. They told us that they will try to. 30 min before departure, we learned by Canadian tourists that the flight had been delayed to 5pm. We ask Air Botswana to book us on another flight for Europe. After long minutes on their back they told us that we were booked on Virgin Atlantic instead of Swiss. It was ok for us even if the transit time would be short (1h20). We only wanted to be in Paris the next morning, so making a stop in Zurich or London wasn't an issue for us. During the flight we asked flight attendants that we will have a short transit time in Joburg and to organize something to make sure we catch our virgin Atlantic flight. We had to ask twice because we made a stop in Gaborone and flight attendants changed. When we arrived a van was there to drive us to the virgin atlantic terminal. Everything seems fine right? Well when we wanted to check in on Virgin Atlantic, the attendants told us that my ticket could not be emitted, leaving my wife alone. No one at Air Botswana told us that there was a problem with the ticket. Due to their incompetence, we had to sleep at the airport hotel. No one form air Botswana helped us for the room booking, Bid airservices employees were the best, they did the hotel room booking for us on behalf of Air Botswana. The next day, we had to stand in front of Air Botswana counter from 10am to 3pm in order to have our ticket to Paris. The manager were unbearable and supercilious. They lied to us numerous time, we had to put pressure on them to have some information about the situation. Note that we booked the whole trip (Maun to Paris) they had to pay for the rest of our journey (air france ticket were 2500 $ per person in premium economy, economy was fully booked). We were with Canadian tourists who didn't book the whole trip and they had to buy again Johannesburg - Montreal ticket something like 3000 $. This was the worst travel experience of my life. And during Air Botswana flight you can't use your smartphone even if it's in airplane mode, and there is no entertainment proposed.",,,,,
"  I was booked on flight BP211 from Maun to Johannesburg, scheduled to depart at 13:50 and arriving at 15:50 on 23 April. At about 13:00 we got a notice that the flight had been delayed to 15:20. No reason was given for the delay. The ground staff assured us that we will be arriving in Johannesburg at about 16:50. Some passengers had connecting flights and were assisted by the ground staff. We were also assured that the plane is on its way and that we will depart for Johannesburg at 15:20. At 15:15 the noticeboard started flashing indicating that we can board, but there was still no plane in sight. Later the flight details disappeared from the noticeboard, but still no plane. Eventually the plane arrived and we started boarding proceedings. We exited the building and upon reaching the plane the cabin crew told us that their plane is going to Gaborone and not Johannesburg. We had to stand around on the tarmac while the crew were running around trying to sort out the mess and calm some very upset passengers down. Eventually we were allowed to get aboard - we were going to be flown to Gaborone and there board another plane to go to Johannesburg. During the flight the captain apologized and told us that the change was because of some technical problems with the other plane. The transition in Gaborone was smooth. We eventually arrived in Johannesburg at 18:36 and I am sure some passengers missed their connecting flights. They were assured that there would be ground staff in Johannesburg to assist them with the transitions. We were all put in the same bus to the terminals and I did not see any assistants when we arrived at the terminals. My biggest issue with Air Botswana is not being truthful with us, their paying customers, in some instances flat-out lying and then dumping us on an unaware operator flight crew, leaving them to attend to upset and frustrated passengers. Very unprofessional.",,,,,
 Johannesburg to Gaborone with Air Botswana. Fast check in at airport. On time boarding and departure. Full flight operated by an ATR 42. Good Crew. A good snack of crackers and local beef jerky served. Landed on time. Fast immigration and was out of airport in minutes. Return flight on same day. Again fast check in. Fast Security control and immigration. On time departure on a newer ATR 72. Rather empty flight with everyone having an empty seat next to them. Good snack and wide array of drinks served by a crew happy to do more than their best. On time arrival in JNB. Small airline but they know what they are doing. Recommended on visits to Botswana.,,,,,
CPT-GBE GBE-JNB. First flight a clean Bae146 in very good condition half empty with loads of leg room. Food excellent for an airline and service find. Second flight on an equally clean ATR72 with equally good snacks. All flights on time. Much prefer them to SAX or Airlink!,,,,,
I will never fly Air Botswana again. Warning to anyone who is considering flying with them: if you expect even mediocre customer service do yourself a favor and stay away. We were supposed to fly from Maun with Air Botswana to land in Johannesburg landing at 4 pm with a full four hours to spare before our long haul flight back to the US via Delta. When we arrived at the Maun airport chaos had ensued. What appeared to be a huge tour group had the spotlight and despite reaching the front of the line to check in we were completely ignored as the attendants told us they needed to tend to others first. Service was exorbitantly slow as there were only 2 attendants who were hand writing boarding passes. After an hour of waiting we were told the flight was oversold and we would not be getting on. We’re convinced that although we had booked our flights 6 months earlier we were bumped along with about 20 others from the flight in favor of the tour group. You can imagine the hysteria as the majority of the 20 had connecting flights in Johannesburg. The attendants assured us that we would get on another plane that was routed to Cape Town but would first stop in Johannesburg to drop us off by 6 pm. We found this odd but at that point had no other choice. It was only after we boarded the plane that we discovered we were instead going to Gaborone and from there another plane would take us to Johannesburg immediately. When we reached Gaborone the Air Botswana rep was extremely confused why we had arrived and told us we had been lied to and would have to wait another 1.5 hours to take off. Not surprisingly the flight was further delayed so we finally arrived in Jo'burg at 8.30 minutes after our second leg to Atlanta took off. We were extremely upset but told we’d be waitlisted for the next Delta flight out - which unfortunately was not for a full 24 hours. The real kicker? We were told you owe us $650 USD. Still can’t quite comprehend how they had the gall to say this to our faces but at this point nothing surprised us. No reps from either Air Botswana or Delta were available to give us a definitive answer on whether we’d be guaranteed to be on the flight so off we went to a local hotel in hopes of returning the next day to get everything straightened out. The people who work for this airline not only have the poorest customer service skills I have ever witnessed. When we arrived on day 2 to try to check in to Delta we were told we only had a 50/50 shot of getting on the plane. There is one flight per day and subsequent flights were all booked solid. We were beginning to think this nightmare might continue on for days and days. Surely there had to be a carrier going to any city in the US that could accommodate us. There was. Two in fact. However Air Botswana would need to book it for us – and they flat out refused. We were only able to get on the Delta flight thanks to their management; the Air Botswana rep was never to be heard from again. I could not be more appalled at the way Air Botswana operates.,,,,,
Fantastic Service. Booked from Australia for Jo'burg to Maun flight. Kept great communications for any changes and even transferred me on a SA flight no extra charge for my Kasane-Jo'burg leg when I explained about connection time with my Qantas flight due to schedule changes without having to be asked and emailed me back a new booking. Great service nice snack on a short leg clean modern plane on time friendly ground staff. I hear things might have been different a few years back but certainly my experience was very good and would fly with them again.,,,,,
Francistown - Johannesburg 16 September. Good short flight efficiently run with good crew. On time and no problems.,,,,,
In August Johannesburg to Maun and Kisane to Johannesburg. Both flights were spot on time. Service on board was fine with drinks and light snacks served for the roughly 2 hour flight in each direction. Aircraft's were in good shape and the seats comfortable for this type of trip. Check-in in Jo'burg was easy and very quick. Check- in in Kisane was a breeze as the airport is tiny. All in a good experience and a great way to enhance your Botswana experience.,,,,,
Like Eric said I don't understand the bad reviews. I have flown the Maun-JNB flight many times and everything has been great. Never had any delays. The last comments are from 2011 and 2010 and now I think they have a brand new fleet. My flight was nice - not the best aircraft.,,,,,
We flew Maun-Johannesburg. Despite the reviews here I was pleasantly surprised. The plane looked new and the leather seats were comfortable. The 2 cabin crew were ok. The plane left on time and landed on time 2 hrs later.,,,,,
Maun-Johannesburg. Short 90 min flight on what appeared to be newer BAE 146. Interior had nice leather seats and the legroom seemed quite good for economy. The flight attendants seemed indifferent (almost as they were being bothered) as they just plodded through the flight. The only problem with the flight was the hot cabin. I had to ask the flight attendant twice before the temperature was lowered to less than an inferno. Apparently on the BAE 146 the cockpit controls the cabin temperature - not the cabin crew.,,,,,
Air Botswana to and from Johannesburg and Maun. The staff were friendly and outward journey JNB-Main was fine. The return journey was chaos! To start with the check-in at Maun airport was chaotic. The lounge was completely full of passengers trying to check in. Air Botswana had chartered another aircraft and upon boarding some passengers had no seats so they were told that they would have to catch the next flight. Once aboard they told us that the aircraft couldn't take our bags and that they would be in JNB on the next flight (apparently 2 hours later). I was connecting with a flight to Europe and if I had known that earlier I could have labelled my bag accordingly and I might have tried to check my bag through the whole way. I felt sorry for the staff as they were polite and tried hard to appease the passengers. They couldn't take the bags for safety reasons which is fair enough. The problem was that they knew this before we boarded the aircraft and chose to tell us once we were aboard. We flew via Gabarone to refuel. Then in Johannesburg a representative met us at the luggage carousel and told us that our bags would arrive tomorrow! At least he was there when our flight arrived and not when the supposed next flight was meant to arrive 2 hours later. However that was a bit of a shock for some of the passengers as Air Botswana must have known this in Maun. He took down all our details and where we wanted our bags sent if we weren't staying in Johannesburg. I honestly didn't expect to see my bag again. Three days later at home in Spain an Air Botswana rep phones me and asks me which airport in Spain I want my bag sent to! Zaragoza is 1.5 hours drive away and the nearest airport. My bag arrived there 2 days later. If any other airline flew between Main and Johannesburg I would try them. I think Air Botswana needs some competition!,,,,,
Maun to Jo'burg. Got on plane and when arrived in Jo'burg our luggage did not. No ones did. Found out afterwards that if it is hotter than 40C they will not take luggage if plane is full. Wish someone would have informed us. We didn't get our luggage back until Zanzibar 2 days later and many frustrating moments in between. Tired plane needs an overhaul or the insides redone. They had a quick stop (which was not on the itinerary or the ticket) in Gabone. It was to turn staff over or something but couldn't get off plane and the 10 minutes turned into 40 without AC doors opened and +40C.,,,,,
JNB-MUB return. Tried to check in early in JNB and was told to come back later as the BP staff had not started working in the luggage area and the check in staff member thought our bags might get pilfered (liked his honesty). The flights both ways use the new ATR 2-2 seating which was comfortable and adequate. To MUB there was a sandwich service with drinks followed by a 2nd drinks service. From MUB there was just nuts with a drink service. On arrival we were told to sit till we were instructed to stand and they were very strict even after the door had been opened.,,,,,
JNB-GBE-JNB. Pleasantly surprised with the flights on ATR's considering we were in the middle of RTW FC Oneworld - unfair comparison. Cabin crew were OK certainly as good as I would expect. The aircraft must have had new paint recently as they looked quite good in and out. Didn't expect to be flying them no spare pages in passport so SA wouldn't allow me in country.,,,,,
Maun to Johannesburg. What a terrible experience. The plane was in disarray & dirty. The cabin staff were dishevelled & not serious. I will never fly Air Botswana again!,,,,,
Johannesburg - Maun Economy Clas BAe-146. On arrival at the airport we engaged the services of a porter. We had 2 rucksacks and 2 camera bags. I paid him around ZAR30 (USD4) and it was well worth it. As we had bought goods in Johannesburg and wanted to claim back tax I told the porter and he zipped us off to a Customs Counter that had no queue (we passed others that had at least 7 people waiting in line). We cleared Customs in no time check in was fast immigration and security had short queues and it took around 15 minutes to get the VAT refund processed. The aircraft was a BAe-146 - load was around 30% so we had 3 seats to ourselves. We were served a drink and a very small sweet roll. Maun airport is a small building with 1 immigration line and a bench where your bags get delivered to. Customs a breeze.,,,,,
Gaborone to Kasane and back. I found the aircraft to be fine - nothing spectacular but clean tidy and in order. Younger cabin crew staff tended to be friendlier and more outgoing whilst older employees seemed weary and even a little sullen. Inflight snack an odd cross between chicken sandwich and summer salad with neither emerging as distinct in itself. My overall impression was of an airline that does a functional job pretty solidly - no delays for me - but could probably add a little more to its approach to customer care. There are plenty worse in Africa!,,,,,
Jo'burg-Maun-Jo'burg. Either we were lucky or Air Botswana are improving. BAe 146 in decent condition flights left on time and the crew were pleasant. The inflight snack was curious but as all Brit passengers are increasingly used to nothing at all this just isn't a problem. Given the flight time and distance our fares were reasonable though not cheap. May the improvement on our (and others') previous bad experiences continue.,,,,,
I travel Air Botswana frequently for trips around the country (as there is no other carrier) and what I cannot understand is the extremly high cost for tickets. I understand they have a monopoly but $500 for a 2 hour flight is absurd! When they do have 'specials' you can call the day they are announced only to find out those cheap seats have already been filled. And their prices compared to SA for flights to Joburg are also incredibly high ($400 for a 1 hour flight). So high that we never fly to Joburg but opt to drive for 4 hours and spend a night in a hotel which works out to a big cost savings although not a time saver. The staff are adequate (although customer service in all of Botswana is poor so it is adequate compared to that baseline)  but not the food. And the flights are frequently late especially leaving from Joburg to Gabs.,,,,,
I have just returned from Botswana - my 6th visit to this lovely friendly country- and must strongly disagree with the comments regarding the quality of the cabin crew . I have always found them to be models of friendly efficient and helpful service. They seem to epitomise the character of the people I have met in Botswana- a ready smile and a genuine concern to help if they can. Air Botswana has an important role in representing this rapidly developing country- yes they must update their aircraft but they have a priceless asset - their staff. Take note Air France & Emirates with your indifferent customer relations.,,,,,
Gaborone to Johannesburg. Not too bad at all. The Pula lounge in Gaborone although tiny is quite a comfortable spot to relax in before the flight. The ATR42 operated on the route is definitely showing its age and seats are fairly uncomfortable. Snack service consists of peanuts and biltong whereas competitor SA Express provides a full sandwich service on board. Crew were friendly - downside being arrival in Johannesburg - for aircraft to overnight in Johannesburg we were parked on a remote stand a good 10-15 minutes from the terminal building.,,,,,
" Overall a positive experience with Air Burkina. This route is a triangle from Ouagadougou to Accra to Abidjan and back. Check-in wasn't fast but was well managed. 10-minute boarding delay was communicated individually by staff but the plane was ultimately on time. Free seating - not an issue as it wasn't fully booked. Clean and fairly well-maintained albeit slightly worn ex-Royal Jordanian plane, good leg room, 12 years old. (There was some tape on both emergency exit handle covers.) Courteous English/French speaking cabin crew and good cockpit communications. 50 minute flight had a good selection of cold drinks including French wine. Luggage arrived without incident.",,,,,
"  I was booked to fly non stop from Abidjan to Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) with Air Burkina. Their website was surprisingly easy to maneuver ,and in a few minutes my ETKT was issued. I guess i was smart to ask the Concierge at my hotel in Abidjan to confirm my flight the day before.Air Burkina had my email,but no notices whatsoever re the dramatic change.To my unpleasant surprise he was told my flight was cancelled, and i was rebooked on a different flight at 0800 rather than 1115. I was at the check in counters at 0600 per the instructions of the reservation office in Abidjan. Im sure the Concierge understood well the new information he received from Air Burkina's office. To my unpleasant surprise i was refused to be checked in and was told to wait, as 'there is a problem with my ticket'. I waited patiently till ALL passengers were checked in, and then i was told by hand signs (No English spoken by the check in supervisor) that the flight is full, and to go and see the agents at Air Burkina's office in the terminal. There i was told by an agent that I'm booked on a different flight at 3pm. I insisted that i had a seat on the early morning flight, as i trusted the information i got from the hotel in the city. I was promised i had a seat at 3pm,but already i had my doubts at that point. I asked why they didn't accept me on the 0800 flight as they cancelled my original flight, and even if i had no reservation per their version, i thought i was entitled to standby for the morning flight. ""No"" was the answer. Reason: the flight was stopping in Accra where it was going to be filled up 100%. I told the agents that i thank them for their efforts, and i am not going to wait 8 hours at the airport for 'maybe' flying at 3pm. I left their office trying to figure out a way out of Ivory Coast as i had a Business class ticket on Ethiopian from Ouagadougou to Addis Ababa, and hoped Ethiopian Airlines would reissue my ticket to fly from Abidjan to Addis. Suddenly i was approached by the Air Burkina agent, who offered me to pay 'penalty' for a flight change from 3pm to 8 am of 50Euro - I had to pay Air Burkina 50 EURO because THEY cancelled my flight. Amazing! The 100% full flight from Accra excuse was no longer an issue. I decided to pay despite the convoluted business conduct of Air Burkina, so i don't miss my visit to Burkina Faso for 50 Euro. I paid, and quickly was rushed to the aircraft. Out of Accra there were at least 20 empty seats and Business class was 100% empty. So much for correct information. The aircraft was an ex LOT airliner in terrible shape, torn seats, dirty cabin, toilets without toilet paper. Drinks were served from Abidjan to Accra's 30 minute flight,and a hot tasty meal was offered on the 1 hour flight from Accra to Ouagadougou. Quite impressive service. What a poor show of caring for customers at Abidjan airport. And their website says that ""the customer is at the center of all they do"" - really?",,,,,
"  Seoul to Kuala Lumpur. When we arrived at the airport 90 min before departure time, the  counter was empty. Nobody up there and the automatic check-in was disabled. After walking all over to find their offices, we were greeted by an employee who told us they closed the counter 90 min prior to flight as a company policy. There was no effort on her part to open the door or offering any alternatives. I dislike that attitude in any kind of service. ",,,,,
"  Seoul to Busan. First time with Air Busan and it was great. Price, App, check in, employees, service,luggage and on time. At the check in I was offered an earlier flight, no fee. There were no problems with this airline and trip. Recommend.",,,,,
"  Osaka to Busan. Great value budget airline. Web site and on-board magazine promise free water but none was offered. Check-in at KIX was about 20 minutes, check-in at PUS was zero with no other customers in sight. Offered decent seats even though we hadn't pre-booked them. Outward flight was delayed due to 'air traffic control restrictions' at KIX but landed on time due to timetable padding. Return flight left early but landed slightly late after circling around western Japan for ages. Boarding on both flights smooth. Bus to terminal at PUS, but sky bridge on return flight. Perfectly adequate and reasonably efficient for a budget airline and a one-hour flight. Would use again.",,,,,
"  My family flew to Daegu from Gimpo. From check-in to boarding, service rendered by all staff were efficient and excellent. Cabin was clean and seats were usual economy class comfy. On our return flight from Daegu to Gimpo, we were late due to traffic and could not check-in thru self serve kiosk. We had barely 15 mins prior to flight departure. Approached counter staff for assistance. First thing the staff did was radioed the Captain while processing the checking in and printing of boarding passes. An agent came over to escort and assisted us throughout the procedure to ensure we boarded the plane without further delay. All these were completed within 15 mins and flight departed on time. Our biggest compliment is towards the Captain for both flights. Journey was smooth and landing was perfect which you dont even feel the plane has landed. Flew with many major top 10 airlines in the world but never had this landing experience ever before. Cabin Crew rating, great and comparable to top airlines! Keep it up and will definitely choose and fly Air Busan on all my destinations where served by Air Busan.",,,,,
"  Today in morning when we were coming Jeju to Busan, it was 10 minutes late, which is acceptable. But after this when all the passengers were in plane and it start to run, they stopped. We were informed that there is an issue and pilot will take plane back. We were kept waiting another few minutes and cabin manager announce that they are looking into it and will give further notice. Crew members were serving water and juice. Further notice kept happening for next two hours and plane finally moved at 12:35 pm, instead of 10:30 am. It was my first time to fly with Air Busan to Jeju, which was a disaster.",,,,,
"Flew Air Busan from Jeju to Busan. No delays - my experience of taking budget airlines gives me an impression that they will surely delay. They served orange juice that was quite nice onboard. Smooth landing at Busan. I slept on board.  But they don't have aerobridge like Korean Air, Asiana Airlines or Jeju air.",,,,,
"We were in Jeju flying to Busan then connecting to Gimpo. I noticed our flight was delayed and we may miss the connection. I queried this with ground staff. Within 16 minutes our flights were changed (at no cost), 4 people's luggage located, dragged across the airport, by tiny female ground staff, identified and reloaded then we were seated in row 1 of the airline and off to Gimpo. Totally amazing. I am still astounded that this happened. Plus a refund on our original flight. Congratulations Air Busan. If I could I would fly this airline regularly - customer service appears to be top of their list.",,,,,
"We highly recommend the staff at Jeju airport. We were booked Jeju to Busan, Busan to Gimpo. Our flight from Jeju was delayed and we would have missed our connection in Busan. The check-in staff were incredible when we queried if they could assist us, they changed our bookings to a direct flight with only 15 minutes to do this. 2 lasses retrieved our luggage (for 4 people, not light) from the original flight, hauled it to the check in desk so we could confirm they had our luggage & all correct, then down onto the tarmac into the plane. This was all completed within approximately 15minutes. It was brilliant of the staff. They were crediting us with the change flight we had incurred earlier and missed the button - it become a payment, - this was not an issue for us, it was only $37.00 Australian and the service those girls gave us was quite unbelievable. Flight was good too.",,,,,
Gimpo-Jeju and Jeju-Gimpo. One of the best budget airlines I have flown with thus far. Air fares were cheap. The seat was really comfortable for such a short distance and legroom room was really spacious (more space than SIA). Beverages were served despite the short flight and FAs were very friendly. Airport staff very polite when we were checking in. Definitely fly with this airline again in the future.,,,,,
"I recently flew Gimpo - Jeju and Jeju - Busan and what a great experience! Fares were cheap included baggage and when I changed my flights to spend more time in Jeju I only had to pay the fare difference. The seats were the same pitch as Qantas (31"") flights departed close to schedule and drinks were served despite the short flight time. The only slight criticism I have is that their website is a bit tricky parts of it rely on Flash which may be why I couldn't get an English version to load on my mobile device also whenever I tried to put my passport details in I got an error - if this happens try selecting ""No passport"" this worked for me. I'll definitely choose them again if I'm flying their routes - great effort!",,,,,
PUS-GMP 737-500. The weather was deteriorating and we were caught off guard by a typhoon heading our way. We got rebooked for free quick and friendly service. At the gate the flights would all be cancelled. The flight was bulk loaded pilots ready. The first delay occurred as extra service agents were called to the gate and were providing information to the passengers. After an hour delay we observed extra pilots boarding as well we learned the captain after deliberating safety being his major concern decided to fly out. A quick boarding nearly full flight and we took off in heavy winds and weather while dark. Despite the weather the pilot remarked thanking us for coming along for the ride saying Hang tight and nice flight which broke the tension. Even though it was a bumpy flight the crew were really calm and nice which calmed us all they spoke English too. It's times like this they must remain calm and they did. Not one time did we feel anything other than our safety was what was most important. A very capable and friendly airline.,,,,,
PUS-CJU B737 Short flight from us an to Jeju Island. Left and arrived on time. comfortable seating. No food served; just a 50cc bottle of water handed out. No inflight entertainment.,,,,,
I flew with my family from Fukuoka to Busan for a holiday. Although we stayed for a night in Busan and then flew to Seoul the next day the airport staff were very helpful and friendly they helped me reserve seats for the second route with leg room. The ticket fee was still attractive even though it was during their New Year. No choice for the drink (only Jeju orange juice) inflight. No delays.,,,,,
FUK-PUS return on an aged 737-400 clean and offering reasonable leg space. Check-in courteous despite I arrived pretty late. No inflight service for such a short flight they served orange juice but it was not necessary to do so if fares go lower. They have an interesting selection of duty free shopping on the plane it's worth trying it. Uneventful trips and luggage arrived safe and sound. I'd wish they offered more routes into Korea from Fukuoka. Very user-friendly website that allows to catch good fares and per it's seat selection. Flying BX was a nice surprise.,,,,,
PUS-GMP. User-friendly website made the ticket purchasing easy. Departure delayed 20 minutes but the plane arrived on time in GMP. Orange juice and water served on a very short flight. FAs were friendly and efficient. Seat pitch and leg room may be a bit tight but I believe it's common for an LCC. Overall a great choice for those who want to take a domestic flight in South Korea.,,,,,
Busan to Jeju. Flight attendants great and tried to have a little fun with the passengers. On the way they served drinks (water/juice/coffee) and a fortune cookie. They also had some kind of draw for a few different gift certificates. Airplane very new and in excellent condition. Seats were quite close together so my legs were almost pressed against the seat in front of me even though it wasn't reclined (if you're tall it might be irritatingly tight). Overall though a pretty good airline and I will fly with them again.,,,,,
Very good considering the fares. I even wonder when they serve drinks on a 50 minutes flight (Seoul - Pusan). I'd rather have a cheaper ticket.,,,,,
Very good friendly and uncomplicated service. Like the fixed prizing. Makes you wonder why it has to be so stressful travelling in Europe with the likes of Ryanair etc. Would always choose Air Busan again.,,,,,
Air Busan was what I would expect from a LCC. Seat pitch a little tight but enough for me. Flight attendants a little abrasive but you can't judge an airline by one flight attendant! Overall good airline and it serves its purpose well; affordable no frills flying so that is what you should expect. South Korea is small so flights with Air Busan are only in the 1 hour range!,,,,,
GMP-PUS-GMP. Very good fast efficient and friendly staff. At GMP ground handling done by Asiana so all the traditional quirks of this great airlines. Served water and OJ on this very short flight.,,,,,
  Worst airline experience I've ever had. Ruined my last day in Egypt. Spent a total of 10 hours in airport due to delays then when arrived in Cairo baggage was also delayed.  Aircraft dirty seats uncomfortable. I booked a tour and this was the flight they sent me on. Never book with this airline. It will ruin your holiday.,,,,,
  Nice flights all on time with friendly staff for a good price. Non of the services offered could be purchased in advance (seats and meals) as all credit cards were rejected. Also shocked to see use of a kettle (!) On the floor behind row 1 in the galley!,,,,,
"  Flight from Cairo to Hurghada was cancelled and they sent me an email at 10:00 pm,  8 hours before the flight time and what I didn’t realize that they also changed the airline to Egyptair. So it’s not the same terminal in Cairo, Terminal 3 instead of terminal which is 18 minutes by car. So I didn’t catch the flight and had to buy a new one way ticket for a flight after 3.5 hour! So after checking in to Hurghada airport for the return flight & everything was fine until the flight is delayed for 19:00 instead of 17:30 and my original booking was for 14:00 but they sent me an email 4 days ago that this flight is cancelled &amp. They chose to give me the sm 63 flight at 17:30. Conclusion: If you have any work on the day of the flight with this airline company be sure that you will not reach on time. Or maybe you will not reach the same day.",,,,,
"  I will forever regret not treating the bad reviews seriously before traveling with Air Cairo. Their flight from Hurghada to Prague turned out to be by far the worst traveling experience of my life. First problems arose when we were notified in Hurghada that our flight was delayed by five hours. I discovered on flightradar24.com that the reason for the delay was the plane having been diverted to Skopje on a flight from Hurghada to Belgrade earlier that day. This was our first warning sign, foreshadowing what was to come next. When we finally took off and headed to Prague, the captain announced that our flight was diverted to Leipzig, Germany due to ""bad weather"" in Prague. The crew also told us that no planes were allowed to land in Prague for this reason whatsoever. When we confronted them with the fact that we were the only plane being diverted, they suddenly changed their story and claimed that our aircraft was not suitable for landing in low visibility. When we proved this to be a lie as well, they changed their story once more and told us that the pilots were inexperienced and therefore not trained for landing in foggy weather. What the real reason for the diversion was and how their side of the story would have developed had we pushed on them further, I have no idea. When we were finally allowed to leave the aircraft in Leipzig, we received no information about future plans whatsoever and the crew simply went to bed. The staff at Leipzig Airport were unable to help us either since the only people who knew at least something about our situation were asleep. At least that is what they said. Furthermore, they denied us access to our check-in luggage in spite of some passengers being in urgent need of their medication. On the plus side, Leipzig Airport provided us with beds and blankets to survive the night, for which we were thankful. Air Cairo, on the other hand, did nothing. The following morning was a disaster as well. A substitute flight from Leipzig to Prague was scheduled first for 5:30am, then for 11:00am. However, we still had no specific information as the airport staff was unable to reach the crew and the management of Air Cairo refused to communicate with us. The airport staff claimed that the only thing for which we were waiting was the crew, who were asleep at the hotel. Yet when the management of Air Cairo finally started answering our questions, they told us that the crew were already waiting at the hotel in their uniforms, not knowing themselves why they were not able to fly. What was the reason for the waiting, then? Were we waiting for the fog in Prague to disappear? We had no idea because no one bothered to tell us. After many hours of stressful waiting, during which we were again given misinformation multiple times and several passengers burst into tears, the crew finally arrived with no further explanation at 12:45pm and we took off at 1:30pm. To sum up, our landing in Prague was delayed by 20 hours. There are, however, two aspects of our situation that are most annoying. Firstly, it was argued that our issues were caused by fog. Yet we were the only plane on that day which had this problem and dozens of other aircraft were perfectly capable of taking off and landing in Prague. The problem was therefore clearly on the side of the airline and their pilots. And secondly, what I consider even more disgraceful was the arrogance with which the airline treated us and all their deception, lies and lack of communication.",,,,,
  The worst service ever. After I paid for my tickets on their official website I got shocked in the airport that they didn't list my name in the list of passengers nor 10 other passengers. While the economy seats were all booked by other passengers already. Moreover they refused to upgrade our seats to business class although it was available and we didn't catch the flight. After many calls the company finally told me to go to another terminal to catch another flight after 4 hours of my original booking. Very unprofessional.,,,,,
  Aswan to Cairo. Delay of more than 4 hours without any representative available to apologise or communicate any details. When buses were taking passengers to the flight they started asking if anyone like to have a snack in order to reduce cost clients around losing sightseeing tours and connections without anyone to care even apologize through airport public announcement.,,,,,
"  Warsaw to Marsa Alam. Although the flights weren’t delayed, I had a bad experience. The staff wasn’t friendly. The planes are old and worn, which makes the seats extremely uncomfortable. Legroom doesn’t exist. Food was terrible. It’s not a good airline",,,,,
"  The flights of Air Cairo starting from Hurghada were all delayed apart from one national flight. Our flight was marked ""delayed"" without any further information. Boarding started 5 min before the estimated departure. Passengers were driven to the Aircraft by bus and had to wait in the bus for 15 min. Then the bus drove back to the gate without any information and there was no staff at the gate. Passengers had to wait for almost 4 hours until boarding started again. Again no official information. The flight was redirected to Cologne instead of Dusseldorf. Therefore there a bus transfer to Dusseldorf was offered, which took a lot of time again. In total the arrival in Dusseldorf was delayed 5.5 hours and the only information we got was unofficial: A passenger said the pilot told him, the airline has failed to get a landing permission for the aircraft in Dusseldorf.",,,,,
"  
I had a fantastic week of holidays in Hurghada and to review a hotel is a must but I also think it is very important to acknowledge the airline which makes it all happen by bringing you over and back in safety. I flew with Air Cairo for the first time there and back after a week and both flights were comfortable and I felt very welcomed. The staff both on the flight on 24 June (Prague to Hurghada) as well as on 1 July (Hurghada to Prague) were friendly, smiley and professional. At one point there was strong turbulence and the staff were supportive. Next time I fly to Egypt I will go for Air Cairo. ",,,,,
  Doha to Alexandria. Flight cancellation without notification and a very rude attitude On the 13th May I had a flight from Doha to Alexandria Borg El Arab airport at 11:30 pm (Doha time). I was travelling with my 1 year old baby. I was in the airport at 9 pm and check for our counter station but couldn’t find the flight and it was scheduled. I started visiting travel and info offices at the airport to check the flight but they told me it is not registered on the airport screens as it is not scheduled in the first place and they guided me to visit the airlines offices next day at Ras Abou Abboud Street at 8am. I was shocked as I had to return back to my office next day. I spent the night in Doha and next morning and they refused to book me daytime and insisted to travel on the same time 11:30 pm on another airline after a two hours debate The country manager of the airline was very rude and had a terrible attitude and didn’t even bother to be a good marketer for his company and was upset to book another flight. This is a cheap low profile airline.,,,,,
" Dusseldorf to Hurghada with Air Cairo. The crew were friendly and professional, they even offered me 2 meals as I was so hungry. The flight had no turbulence and we reached Hurghada safely and on time. Great experience. Compared to the german company I flew back with the staff with Air Cairo was way more friendly and offered more food and drinks free of charge.",,,,,
Istanbul to Sharm El Sheikh and Cairo to Istanbul: The planes were new clean Airbus 320. They didn't serve us a hot meal only refreshments (butter cookies and a drink). Even the flights have been delayed for 2 hours on both ways I recommend Air Cairo.,,,,,
This airline made a lot of improvements : new aircraft good crew hot meals - no problem at all during flight.,,,,,
Brussels to Luxor. Good charter airline. Modern A320 aircraft with friendly fa's. No entertainment onboard but hot meal served.,,,,,
"  When I tried to check in for my flight online, I found Air Canada completely changed the details of my flight, and didn't notify me. The new flight that was forced on me was so bad, that there was no way I could just accept it. After a long wait on the line, the airline representative (who didn't even offer an apology, let alone a compensation), said the only thing he could do was to rebook the flight to a later date, or give me a refund. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, he said there were no supervisors.  I had no choice but to rebook the flight, with all the inconveniences attached to it. Then the rude representative just hung up on me mid-call, so I had to call back and wait forever again just to verify that the details of the new flight were indeed finalized.  Terrible customer service, unreliable airline company.",,,,,
" July 23 flight cancelled then gave us a hotel, gave us a new booking for July 24. Super delayed that it messed up the connecting flight. If I can count the changes of that flight was 6 times! Then hours of waiting to check in at Manchester. Then now we are trapped at Canada looking for our baggage that we are unable to find because of their poor operational activity! Everything about this company is poor! Just don’t continue the service anymore not until you guys fix your problem! It’s embarrassing to the country since you guys carry their flag! From your resources issue to your customer service and all! Fix it all!",,,,,
" On 7/13/23 we had a flight that was supposed to depart at 5:35PM, but was delayed 3 whole hours for some aircraft malfunction. The staff did provide vouchers for food but it did not apply to all airport restaurants. Regardless we arrived at our destination of Vancouver extremely late. Today on 7/24/23 we came back to Dulles DC at 4:20PM on time as scheduled, BUT there was another plane at our gate and we were stuck on the airstrip for over an hour. Multiple people missed their flights due to this and we were frustrated to say the least. Although the staff and service were nice. The delays are unacceptable and there needs to be more alternative planes/gates.",,,,,
" Canceled connector flight, lost luggage to and from London, garbage customer service in Pearson Airport. Nobody working counters. 2 hours on the phone to find luggage. Disconnected! Another 2 hours on the phone. I would NEVER recommend this airline to anybody. When I fly Delta, it’s smooth every single time. This experience was pure trash. Heck, Spirit is better!",,,,,
 The flight was 2 1/2 hours late for no obvious reason. Service if you can call it so was abysmal. Plane was dirty and stank like a garbage dump. Had to pay $75 for a single suite case.,,,,,
"  The worst flight from Montreal to Toronto, they canceled the flight 5 hours before departure and I was waiting at the domestic airport after security, no assistance from customer support or airport representatives, everyone is just saying to mail customer service. Will never take and will also tell family and friends to never take this airline in the future, don’t mind paying more for a better quality airline.",,,,,
" Air Canada is the worst company. Sold overpriced tickets from Phoenix to Montreal. Upon arrival in Montreal, they waited on the plane for one hour until they free up space on the door. In general, the earth and the sky in comparison with American Airlines.",,,,,
  We were flying from Ottawa to Florida and lost both of our strollers. We had to pay for rental strollers everyday at Disney and when we came back we submit our claim online & they offer to give us 25% off on our next flight. We refused the offer and asked for money toward our new strollers. They denied our offer and said now you don’t get the 25% off either and the case is closed. We flew with air Canada all these years but from now on we will never fly with Air Canada or recommend to anyone anymore.,,,,,
" Air Canada is very consistent with their horrible operations! Check in: Sydney staff were friendly but lack of experience, Montreal staff were rude and unprofessional, 2/10 On board experience: Full flight, bad seat pitch and width 1/10, FA 3/10, Food 1/10, Entertainment 3/10, Boarding 1/10. 1 Cancelation and all departures / arrivals were delayed 1/10.",,,,,
  Awful baggage handling and customer service. Not only was my flight delayed for over 2 hours but my suitcase has wasn't transported. I have now waited 60 hours and still no contact to say where it is. How do you lose my suitcase for a 1½ hour flight?,,,,,
" First, they changed the tyre; then engine, then another issue - why didn't you check the night before? The plane has been in overnight! Do you know how many people's trips are impacted, and how many plans you have ruined? Please, just do your job. Been a frequent flyer, and Air Canada Gold member for 10 years I can't help but giving AC a 2/10 star. Since the pandemic was over, from 2022-2023, AC has lost my luggage TWICE (it took them 25 days to get my luggage back; and I found it; and they didn't compensate my extra flight to look for my luggage). Also, there have been multiple delays - NOT because of weather. It's terrible management and incompetent customer service. I wonder if it would make any difference if there were a competitor in this territory. We, as consumers, sadly, have no choice. Also, AC workers have union's protection - do we, consumers have any protection?",,,,,
" Flight was delayed by almost 4 hours. I submitted a claim for compensation. I am eligible for $400 compensation for person for a total of $800. They replied to me saying ""the compensation you are requesting does not apply because the disruption was caused by an event outside of our control"". Here are the SMS updates that AIR CANADA was giving me while waiting at the airport: 1. Your flight AC515 to Seattle is delayed further until 20:00 due to a technical issue from an earlier flight. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and we'll keep you updated if anything changes. 2. Your flight AC515 to Seattle is delayed further until 21:30 due to additional time needed to tow the aircraft. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and we'll keep you updated if anything changes. 3. Your flight AC515 to Seattle is delayed further until 21:45 due to additional time needed to tow the aircraft. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and we'll keep you updated if anything changes. All of those events are not out of your control. Step your game up Air Canada and give us our compensation.",,,,,
" Worst airline/travel experience of my life! My family of 7 is returning to Chicago from a wonderful vacation in Greece, with a layover in Montreal. Board plane Thursday night, 6/29 in Montreal, gate is pulled away, we sit on tarmac for 30 minutes, pilot then comes on intercom and says there is a mechanical problem (never verified or confirmed by anyone at Air Canada/United). Everyone deplanes, we wait in 2 separate lines for over an hour before getting to counter...Air Canada rep rudely says they don't do rebooking at the counter, but here's a taxi and hotel voucher (for 1 night - we were stranded for 3!) every other air carrier does their very best to reroute passengers at the gate, Air Canada basically said shove it! Then waited on hold (at # AC rep gave us 'here, call this # and they will solve all your problems') for over 2 hours before AC rep came on line and said since tix were purchased through United, we needed to call them (4 hour wait time with United) phone reps zero help (we were suggesting alternative routes/cities, etc that they hadn't even considered) - we were stranded in Montreal through Sunday at an extra expense of over $1500 in hotel/food fees. Air Canada/United didn't lift a finger or care one whit about trying to satisfy us, acknowledge they had hosed everything, or try to get us home expediently. Air Canada gets a letter grade of F (will never fly that airline again) United gets a D+ (only because after days of being stranded, they are how we got home. Tragic and horrible example of air travel in 2023.",,,,,
"  Air Canada Seattle to Comox was the worst flight of my life. In a short flight from Seattle to Comox with a connector in Vancouver. The connector is a 20 minute flight from Vancouver to Comox. I experienced 11, yes 11 delays and gate changes. A screen shot cannot show the frustration or physical pain caused by Air Canada's lacking. Running through large busy airports. Gate changes that required taking the tram in Seattle to different gates. Standing in lines of enraged customers to Information desks. All of us just trying to get to our destinations. It looked like a riot may ensue at the Vancouver airport in the Air Canada section. Employees that were trying hard, but also up against a behemoth company that seemed to care as little for them as they do for their customers. I kept apologizing to employees for expressing my frustration but I was never offered a manager to talk to. I was offered a card with numbers to call. I would not last a day as an employee for this company. I felt so bad for my fellow Canadians that have to work for a company that is so bad that they should not use the word Canada in their name. I could have made this travel by buses and ferry in about 10 hours. My travel by Air Canada with checkpoints and lines started in Seattle before 11am and ended more than 12 hours later. My 66 year old back, legs and bum still hurt the next day as I write this.",,,,,
" The most disgusting and disappointing experience that I ever had with any airline, as always they overbooked the flight and they didn't let me in on a flight that paid 2000$ for, all they care about is money.",,,,,
" 3 hours late to take off, poor/slow loading sequence, Air bridge failed to join at Vancouver so sat on runway waiting an hour late for international connection. Aircrew barged down the aisle as usual. Only benefit was I finally was able to use overhead luggage space. Air Canada is my least favourite air travel experience after LAX.",,,,,
 I took the flight on 4th July! Sydney to Vancouver and Vancouver to Toronto. They said my luggage will be in Toronto. When I land in Toronto no luggage. File the complaint after 4 hours at the airport! Today is day 11 still no information. My blood pressure medication and my other prescription medication is in the bag. I kept only doses for me! I am without medication! Called Air Canada customer service they are saying we are still tracking. Very bad customer service and no information yet!! Very unorganized airline!! Never going to travel in Air Canada.,,,,,
"  Our flight from Paris to Toronto was delayed by over 3 hours. No big deal. It happens. Toronto to Portland was another story. Because the connection was tight, Air Canada decided to bump us to a Toronto to Vancouver for an overnight, then onto Portland. They didn't bother to consult us; they just did it, without mentioning where we were expected to spend the night, or who would pay for it. When we arrived at Toronto our flight to PDX was also delayed. That made it possible to get back onto our original flight, but not without scrambling from the gate, to customer service, then racing back to the gate again. The customer service approved us for boarding our original flight. When we returned to the gate, the agent there questioned our permission to board. After grumbling about how the other agent had left him to do ""his"" job, he finally agreed to give us seats. We boarded, went to our assigned seats, then were told we couldn't sit there because they were crew seats. The gate guy had given us seats assigned for crew only. We had to dash around to find two seats. A kind passenger agreed to move so that we could sit together.  In the four-plus hour flight, no blanket, no pillow, no food unless you paid for it, no media, no magazines. Only a 2-beverage service. The seating was so tight. As expected, in the change from one flight to another, our bags didn't arrive with us. It was 10:30 at night. Not one Air Canada agent, either in lost luggage or ticketing was present at PDX. ""They go home at 9pm,"" we were told. So, we were unable to file a missing luggage report. This morning, I tried to go online to report our missing bags (Air Canada calls them ""delayed"" bags, not missing). It turns out that unless you've got a file number that's issued at the airport, you cannot use the online system; you must call a service number. I waited 34 minutes on the phone for an agent. When she answered, her accent was so strong that I had to ask her to repeat every question several times. I had to repeat my answers to her questions several times. She asked me for an ""original booking number"" that, according to her, was on my boarding pass. It was not. I checked it repeatedly. When I explained that I could not find it (I had my ticket number, my name, flight numbers, baggage tags...etc.), she hung up on me. I called again. I waited about 25 minutes on the second call. I politely explained that I could not understand him, and ended the call. Air Canada did text us. It looks as if our bags may arrive by tonight. ",,,,,
" Absolutely farcical service. Missed my connection at Toronto as the flight was delayed. Rebooked me via Montreal so needed an additional flight, every one of the 4 flights I tried to make were delayed. Having eventually made it to San Jose about 30 hours later than intended, they have also lost my bags. The worst possible airline and the worst possible service you could ever expect. Do not fly with them.",,,,,
" This is the worst airline that you can fly on. First of all, my flight from Calgary to Toronto was delayed for more than 6 hours so I was not able to catch a connecting flight to Frankfurt. I was rebooked on flight that was after 2 days, so basically stranded at Toronto airport for the next 2 days. The worst of all they didn't even care to give me a hotel room to stay in. When I asked for it the agent on rebooking counter asked me to book a room at my cost and Air Canada will reimburse me for it. Later when I submitted the receipt for reimbursement, they denied saying they don't do any hotel reimbursements. ",,,,,
" I think this is the 5th time I’ve flown with Air Canada where the flight has been cancelled due to maintenance issues or other problems. We were all boarded on the plane at sat for an hour then we’re told to wait 2-3 hours while they dealt with maintenance, then proceeded to cancel the flight and rebooked everyone for a different day. They were not able to provide any alternatives for the day and this is a common occurrence for Air Canada. Are they not able to check on the maintenance before they board all the passengers? Overall Air Canada is inconsistent and you likely won’t make your flight. I recommend West Jet instead for domestic flights, much more consistent.",,,,,
  Air Canada cancelled our flight two hours before it was supposed to leave. No one helped us or cared. We ended up on the phone with Air Canada I’m the airport trying to rebook for over an hour and they were not able to find us a different flight. As a result our entire family trip to Disneyland had to be canceled. Crying kids and adults - absolute devastation and Air Canada did nothing.,,,,,
"  An expected 10AM departure on AC was cancelled at 8AM. I spoke with AC Call Center at 8:40 (?Philippines) and was told that 'this is either AC or United Airline but we cannot be certain'. I asked to be placed (40 minute call so far) on next available flight and she indicated that she would try to re-route me from Boston to Newark to Montreal. She then disconnected the line. I called back and another indicated that I was now no-Show for Bost-Nwk-Montreal and all my tickets had been cancelled. She indicated that I could now only purchase a first class ticket at 16:40 for Bos-Yul at C$1600 as no economy seats were available, For a meeting that was time sensitive, I had no choice. I await a refund but discussions with Bos Help Center and YUL Help Center leaves me pessimistic of any resolution.",,,,,
" The customer service agent at the Montreal-Trudeau airport was nothing but ignorant, the expression on her face was disgraceful and her lack of caring really showed. The flight got delayed for 1/2 hour than an hour and now 3 hours. I will miss my connecting flight and all charges are on me. This airline needs to wake up if they want to continue transporting human beings and treat them as such. Very disappointing but not the first time. There is always some type of show attached to this company. Be aware.",,,,,
 First time flying Air Canada and very disappointed for a ‘flagship airline’. Bought expensive long haul tickets and then they want you to pay £50 each to choose seats next to each other. Flight was delayed two hours for ‘technical issues’ then another hour while they tried to find volunteers to give up their seat due to over booking. Once on the plane we sat there for an hour before take off and had to ask three different staff for headphones so we could watch the entertainment system while we waited. Would expect this service off a cheap airline but not Air Canada,,,,,
"  Worst experience. London to Toronto flight was 2 hours late, which of course means the luggage didn't make the connecting flight from Toronto to LA. Call waiting time is over 90 minutes and staff claim they cannot call you back. Baggage tracking is useless and no one takes any responsibility for finding your bags. It is a disgraceful lack of service. Air Canada couldn't care less. We have another flight in 36 hours and there is a possibility we will have to get on that with no baggage. We've seen other reviews of people experiencing the same thing we are. It's appalling. Air Canada have gone to great lengths to put automated phone services in place to avoid having staff to take ownership of these issues and get the job done.",,,,,
"  We had three bags checked with Air Canada and they lost all three. Tried many times to contact customer service but they kept me on hold for an average of 90 minutes, and the calls are farmed to another country, and it was sometimes impossible to understand the operators. I was able to go to the airport the next day and collect two of my three bags but the third one was lost. This was the important one with clothing and medications. I continued to call the lost baggage number four times (total hold time was 425 minutes) on July 5 and got different answers from each one as to the location of the bag. Tried calling Air Canada's front office, but they only respond to emails (I guess they are afraid to hear customers yell at them). So I sent them an email on the complaint form and got the following answer in my email: ""Due to the higher number of current requests, it may take as long as 45 days for an Air Canada representative to get back to you."" I am now starting day three without my bag and no answers or help from the airline.  I never felt so helpless.",,,,,
  We had a connecting flight from Toronto to Montreal after our flight from Rome and we waited over an hour for our luggage. There were 6 flights on the board and not one luggage came out. Our flight also was removed from the board and nothing showed up and we had very little help. This was very time stressful and annoying as we had no idea where our baggage was.,,,,,
" Frankfurt to Toronto was over 1 hour late arriving. Scheduled for 1915hrs actual was 2030hrs. Air Canada (AC) knew this would cause EVERY USA bound connecting flights to be missed because the US Customs would be closed before we could get off the plane. Not to mention the sheer distance between our gate and customs would require landing at least 15 minutes minimum before closing to even try to reach customs before closing. No announcement that we would be stuck in Toronto. No offer of assistance to get us re-booked on a flight after Customs opened again at 0410hrs the next day. No help desk at the airport that apparently CAN help us. 2030hrs When arriving at the closed US Customs the security guy said, ""we're closed. come back at 0430 when we reopen"" When I told him that we had connecting flights to catch, he said ""Welcome to Canada please go downstairs and go through Canada immigration."" I thought that meant we could go through that process and still make our flights, but turns out he was actually welcoming us to Canada as we were stuck there tonight and weren't going to make our connecting flight. We were actually told to talk to the person at the desk when you get off the elevator for additional information but that turned out to be a grumpy older man telling us he's not there to help anyone, just go through the line over there. Which was Canadian Customs and Immigration. Several flights were cancelled on the same night to the US. AC claimed would be handled automatically and notified via email about their new flights, but since my connecting flight still left as scheduled but without me or my family, it wasn't like that situation for us and we didn't get automatically rebooked for the next possible flights via email. Waited in the luggage location line for about 45 minutes about our luggage to be sure it wasn't going to the US without us. After learning the luggage was staying in Toronto, they said it would be safer to keep it in 'the system' and get the luggage assigned to your new flight and it will make it there. Otherwise it would take HOURS to locate and get them to us and we would have to check it back into the system anyways once we were rebooked. This was actually true in the end. We asked around for help and were directed by announcement to follow the ""connections"" signs to get help there. After waiting a while, that staff was clearly overwhelmed and actually started yelling at the customers about how they were NOT going to help anyone about rebooking or vouchers or anything. The line started getting very long when the staff started shouting over the public address, ""we are only two people here and we are not going to help anyone get rebooked, or hotel vouchers, or meal vouchers. You need to go upstairs where there are 15 people up there to help you. That turned out to be a lie. We followed the instructions, which ended up being the ticket counters on the departure floor, but eventually were yelled at again by a queen bee in charge stating that their only job is to help people check into their flights and since we didn't have any flights to board as our flight left without us, it was NOT their job to help us get rebooked. No remediation or assistance was given as to how we could resolve the situation either. I tried asking the special assistance table how I might get help and, after explaining our situation, she told us to go to the other area of ticketing counters for my spec",,,,,
"  Most inexperienced and inconsiderate staff. Kept making stupid errors, such as putting the car seat check-in sticker on the luggage and vice versa. They called the help desk a million times and kept interrupting each other. We stood at the desk for 2 hours.",,,,,
"  I purchased a ticket to fly Washington-Nairobi return in business class via Toronto, Frankfurt and Zurich late June/early July 2023. All flights but the first were code shares on other reputable carriers, Lufthansa, Swiss and United. I've had excellent experiences with Air Canada in the past and really looked forward to this family trip. Just before departure, Air Canada cancelled its flight from Washington because of staff shortages. I called Air Canada and, secured a satisfactory booking via Montreal. That was almost immediately cancelled, leaving me trying to call Air Canada support till around 4am. After multiple calls and hours on hold, I was booked on a United flight to Toronto connecting with Lufthansa on to Nairobi. When I arrived at Washington Dulles, United reported that AC had only made a booking, but had not reissued my ticket as required AC staff at the airport said they were only ramp agents, they couldn't sort out the problem. I had to call Air Canada customer support. Eventually, they called AC support, waited 45 minutes on hold, and then had the needed ticket issued. I thought, foolishly, that my problems were over. Alas, AC had only reissued an outbound ticket from Toronto to Nairobi, without replacing the original round trip ticket. When I arrived in Nairobi, my return flight had disappeared from the Lufthansa system on the grounds that I was a no-show for the outbound flight, leaving me stranded in Nairobi. After an entire night and half a day trying to reach Air Canada support, AC staff finally agreed to restore my return ticket. Reaching AC took about an hour and a half on hold on each occasion, and AC dropped most of these calls after a few minutes. Only on arrival at Nairobi airport did I realize that AC had bungled my return ticket, having me depart Frankfurt for Zurich before I arrived in Zurich. Fortunately, the Lufthansa staff in Nairobi were able to sort this out on departure. I understand hat it's tough running an airline right now, resurgent demand, staff and plane shortages, forest fires etc. But the AC system demands that clients call their agents way more than should be necessary. And, at the moment, ACs customer support lines are totally overwhelmed. Having to spend whole nights trying to get through to Air Canada support to deal with repeated errors made by Air Canada staff is totally unacceptable. ",,,,,
"  Late departing Montreal which, according to the captain during an announcement, was because some meals still needed to be loaded on board. Chief Purser later told me that ""there are bunch of things that we didn't get today"" which means that us, the passengers, won't have those. Dinner service was a bit shambolic with the cabin crew in business class seeming uncoordinated and disjointed. My main course arrived barely warm, so I asked that it be heated up again. It returned quite some time later dried out. It certainly wasn't a meal I'd have expected in a premium cabin on a major carrier. What I have learned about this particular route is that the back of the business cabin is preferred by some customers who have their adult children sitting in the next cabin back (Premium Economy) such that the adult child can frequently come up to the business cabin to check on their elderly parent. I met a Premium Economy passenger in the second J class galley who said he booked his elderly parent's seat that way in order to be able to check on them during the flight. What this means for other passengers is a constant flow of people coming from Premium Economy to check on ""mummy"" up in business class. It makes the cabin feel busy and noisy and one has to endure great long chats between adult child and hard-of-hearing mummy about how to maneuver mommy's seat, etc. I have about eight such passengers around me and feel like I'm in a flying nursing home.",,,,,
"  From check-in to boarding our experience was excellent. Regular texted updates, efficient bag drop and speedy boarding. The service from the attentive staff was excellent. The food was amazing and a reasonable choice of wines. The seats were comfortable and roomy. Great experience. Will do again!",,,,,
"  The flight attendants were amazing. One in particular, Jessie (sorry if I spelled that incorrectly) went above and beyond. She addressed any concerns passengers had. My friend and I were concerned we wouldn't be able to eat, so she gave us some of her snacks because she didn't need them. Those who were worried about connecting flights, she assisted right away. Will definitely fly with Air Canada again.",,,,,
"  This is literally the worst airline ever. I have been stuck in Canada for 2 nights, soon to be a third, due to their incompetence and disregard of passengers. Our connecting flight (which would have been 60 minutes) was abruptly canceled due to no staffing. We encountered quite possibly the rudest woman on earth at the ""customer service"" area. Not only was she nasty and callous, booking us for a flight in 3 days, she didn't offer any information about what to do next, she literally turned her back. We had to ask a security guard where to go next to try to remedy our situation. 5 hours later, we were sent to a hotel nowhere near the airport with only one night of hotel paid. Fast forward to today, we are still sitting in the airport. Our flight was due to leave 4.5 hours ago. Initially, it was delayed for a late crew, then maintenance, then weather. We finally boarded, only to sit on the runway for 90 minutes before we were deplaned. We have not been provided food or information about what happens next. ",,,,,
  Cancelled my first flight due to no crew and provided no hotel or meals for the night. I had to book and pay for hotel and meals myself and now I have to try to jump through all of their hoops and waste more of my time to try to get reimbursed. I had to wait 1.5 hrs at check in the next day. Late flight to Toronto next day caused me to miss connection to Vancouver. Hotel again $20.00 CAD for meals. Re routed me through LAX the next day with a 10.5hr layover They didn't send my luggage with me and said it will be a day late. We'll see their computer and phones systems don't work along with everything else.,,,,,
"  Very inexperienced staff handling matters. The standard answers given to customers are: ""we cannot amend anything"", ""we cannot assist on our end"", ""please call the hotline instead"". Amazing, unprofessional display of attitudes. Employees were just eager to walk away and go home as airport is closing for the day, while many customers are left stranded waiting for the airport to reopen in several hours. Unexplainable reasons being given when aircraft were delayed.",,,,,
"  I'd rather not go on the trip than fly with Air Canada. I was stuck for over 24 hours at the airport with no food or drink or idea of how I'd get home. The flight was delayed 100% on them and the manager said he ran out of everything and we'd have to sleep on the floor until someone can rebook our tickets. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Waited in line for over 5 hours. Had to scream in order for a answer to sleep on the floor. Worst experience ever, still trying to get in contact with them to receive a refund and compensation. No help at all. Customer service line has to high of call volume and hangs up on you.",,,,,
" This trip was not enjoyable. As a start, there was 2+ hour delay. The crew at Vancouver Airport spoke very little English, and had zero interest in guiding about compensation. Some said finally after looking at brochures: you can get a meal voucher. That queue (100 m line pointed out) gave up on that one. The flight from YVR to YYZ was OK in my seat almost at the back. But Air Canada really should revise their customer message system. First the safety video is like 8 minutes. Then you are forced to view COMMERCIALS for another 5 minutes. Not even Ryanair would do that. And on top, EVERY video were starting with more commercials, that thankfully could be skipped. Once the flight got off, Air Canada interrupted the screen, movies etc, with announcements literally every 10 minutes. First in English, then in French. After the 10th announcement to please take seats and fasten belts, something they did at every small bump, people were like: Yeah, we got it. A simple icon lighting up has worked for years elsewhere. I wish the screen could be set to non-interrupt. Second leg was also delayed 2+ hours. Again NO compensation. Nobody to ask about anything. This flight had much worse seats. Plastic shells like Ryanair, and very narrow. Old lagging movie screens, and again same commercials, same interruptions. Of course in French, on a plane headed to Scandinavia. There probably was 0 French speakers on board. Food served was a tasteless chicken boiled to oblivion. Just before landing in CPH, a ""continental breakfast"" was served. A VERY dry croissant, and a minimum yoghurt. That's it? Air Canada, you completely fail this breakfast. Among the many announcements, there was not really any about the flight route, or connections on arrival. I would not choose Air Canada again.",,,,,
"  Horrible experience compounded by zero customer service. Our flight our of Toronto to Lisbon was cancelled a few hours before departure due to ""crew issues"". We spent the night in Toronto and the following day and were re-booked on a charter flight the next evening via Manchester, where we had a 7 hour layover. No communication the entire time, including the hotel booking in Toronto. And now I just received an e-mail stating that they will not compensate me as they have determined it was ""less than a 3 hour delay"". Never again Air Canada, beyond ridiculous.",,,,,
" They refused to hold our flight for us even though the plane did not leave yet. On our way home from Rome they completely canceled our flight last minute, literally the day of our previous flight and now me and my family of six are stuck in Canada and all we want is our warm beds. This place also has horrible service and customer service moved us around so much. We ended up getting home three days later than our due date. Me and my family were sent to a hotel without any clothes for two days straight. Can’t believe an airline could possibly be this bad. Would not recommend. If you want to have a good vacation or travel then take my advice.",,,,,
"  Absolutely terrible, plane was delayed for 2hrs while seated on plane because they had to close a cargo door. The airline did not enforce place entrance hierarchy and people from all sections boarded at the same time. No refreshments served during the 2hr+ waiting period while one the plane and the staff told us many times they had no idea why there was still a delay. I will never be flying air Canada if I can avoid it!",,,,,
"  We got a vacation of a lifetime and upgraded to business class on the way out of Toronto. Of course, Air Canada didn't miss an opportunity to ruin this experience. We boarded our first plane, got comfortable, and then noticed that it's getting increasingly hot and we're not really going anywhere. Then the plane went dead, and rebooted itself. At this point the captain announced that we're having trouble with the air conditioning, and the plane would be rebooted again. After an hour or so on the plane, we were told we need to get off, but not go too far away, since they need to reset the AC and can't do it with us on the plane, and it'll take about 30 minutes. Then we got delayed by another 30 minutes. Then by 30 minutes more. All this time we had to hang around the loud, noisy, crowded gate to ensure we don't miss boarding. Turns out, we didn't need to worry, because the flight eventually got delayed by three more hours for a total of 6.5 hour delay. We did fly out on a second plane, but well past midnight. To add insult to injury, Air Canada refused to provide any compensation for the disruption, claiming it was ""unforeseen safety issue"".",,,,,
  Basically we are waiting for this flight to Toronto for 3h and the employees don't explain when we are boarding. They keep delaying more and more. Everyone is standing waiting on their feet for hours waiting to board and they simply don't open the gate and start the process. And this is the second 3h+ delay in a week. And for sure they won't reimburse us. Horrible service.,,,,,
"  I purchase the $10/1 hour Wi-Fi to write this review. I flew from Phoenix to Toronto and it was tolerable with the right positioning - the flight from Toronto to Amsterdam is absolutely horrific. The seats are narrow, I’m currently squeezed between the wall and the guy in the middle seat and our thighs still touch. Neither of us can get comfortable enough to sleep. I wish I would have spent the extra $100-200 booking with another airline. These seats are making this trip miserable so far.",,,,,
" My flight from Lisbon to Toronto, AC811, was cancelled on June 18, 2023, due to the crew reaching their maximum duty day limit. The fact that the airline did not contact me via email to rebook my flight, despite giving me assurances that they would, is very concerning. Additionally, waiting on hold for four hours and not receiving any assistance is unacceptable. I had to purchase another flight with a different carrier to get home, as I was left with no other option. I came back home 48 hours after they cancelled my flight. Air Canada did not handle my situation with the level of care and customer service that one would expect from a reputable airline. After calling their client care all I got from the person called Brendan is to file a complaint online. Horrible experience, horrible company, horrible client care. Do not fly with them! If you do, make sure to buy the most expensive flight insurance that exists, because if you don't you will not be compensated.",,,,,
" Worst airline ever. Delays, no explanation. No “gate agent”, so we sit on tarmac for 45 minutes in the sweltering heat. I have a connecting flight to London, no one even asks or mentions it.",,,,,
 Delay after delay. Worst consumer service ever. Overbooked. Nightmare. Every time that I flight Air Canada is the same story. Do not book with them.,,,,,
"  We flew back to London from Vancouver on 12 June. The flight was originally scheduled to take off at 19:25, we got the message of delay for an hour in that morning, then another delay and another one due to their not being able to get a plane there.  By the time it took off from Vancouver it was after mid-night. I was so tired and went straight to sleep. When I woke up, it was breakfast time, and all I got was a croissant in plastic bag and a small yoghurt. I wrote to complain and try to get compensation from them, and they wrote back 3 days later to say you are not eligible to receive any compensation. Not a single word to apologize for the misery I went through. ",,,,,
"  We started our day with a delayed flight from Milan (through AC) due to a technical issue. This had us sprinting through the Montreal airport to get through customs and to our gate in time for our connection flight (also through AC). We arrived just in time for boarding - phew! Just kidding because after we boarded the plane, the pilot made an announcement that we all needed to deplane due to another technical issue. After deplaning, there was no in-person communication at all. The woman at the gate provided no apology or information whatsoever. We just received several emails saying we were delayed again and again. We ended up leaving more than 2.5 hours late, and we were again harassed by the same woman checking us in (she actually took my boyfriend’s passport and wouldn’t give it back to him because he’d removed his gate check tag thinking he’d receive a new one since our plane and gate had changed.  She was just too annoyed and lazy to simply print out a new one. Terrible customer service. Not to mention we payed more than $1800 RT for these flights, and the quality of service and their planes were subpar. Will not be flying this airline again (even though I’m an Aeroplan member) nor will I be recommending to friends.",,,,,
"  We booked tickets to fly from the US to Spain and Air Canada cancelled or changed legs of the trip repeatedly leading up to the flight itself. After calling their customer support repeatedly (and sitting on hold for eons) we got to an agent who confirmed our eligibility for a full refund (also had that in writing) and the agent advised us to cancel our tickets online for the “full refund”. After cancelling the tickets as instructed we find out that the tickets had only been partially refunded and the Customer Support agent had instructed us to follow a process that according to Air Canada is “self-cancelled” despite the fact that they had changed the flights and acknowledged our right to a full refund. We contact their customer support 5 times to explain the situation only to be told, nope sorry we are going to fraudulently keep your refund because you followed the wrong process. Long story short do not ever fly or book tickets with this airline. Horrific customer support, poor communication, training, website functionality - a terrible experience from the moment I regrettably pushed the “purchase tickets” button. Fraudulent crooks. They will end in bankruptcy soon enough.",,,,,
" We fly very frequently. I use always go out of my way to book Air Canada. Now, I avoid Air Canada where ever possible. The past few years Staff from check in to boarding to flight attended are just rude. Like the passengers are an inconvenience! Their sole job is to service the passengers and keep us safe. Not deal with passengers like cattle. Do not use safety as an excuse for your ill mannered behaviour. This is me observing how they deal with the majority. If you do not like your job then go find something else to do. Or perhaps a culture coming from the top!! Or is it a monopoly ???",,,,,
" Great experience after 2 not so good flights lasting 15 hours. We were pleasantly surprised by the friendliness and warmth shown by crew during our flight. Comfortable seats, clean pillows and blankets loaded infotainment is all we really needed to complete our trip. Food was just ok, would like to see better choices here. And no free option for Wi-Fi, only paid service for a flight that isn't cheap. Anyway, a memorable and pleasing flight for sure, will definitely fly again.",,,,,
"  The flight was delayed as many families with children were late and the plane waited. I was on time and sat on the tarmac for an hour. Our flight was at 940am we didnt take of until 1045am. After take-off, the entertainment was abysmal as you had to pay extra to login on your phone to watch anything and it was always loosing connection and screwing up. Then a stewardess screamed at me, for me to turn the volume down. The volume was not loud at all. What happened to customer service? She screamed across 2 people as I was at the window. If I acted the way she did at my job, I would have been fired in a heartbeat. Food on the menu was not available by the time the flight attendants got to my row to ask for orders. They had a cookie and a Pepsi, this was what was left. The flight back on September 1st was even worse. I was stuck next to the flight attendant seat so I had this wall of intrusive plastic pushing me out of my seat for 2 hours and 20 minutes. I could not move my left arm without banging it into this wall of plastic. I understand airplane seats are cramped but this big plastic seat intruded on my space. I at least got some food on the flight home, for an extra cost of course. The attendants were maybe one notch better than the trip going, but thats not saying much at all, they were still rude and abrasive.",,,,,
"  This was a new plane and it was the least comfortable I have been on an overseas flight. The legroom was unacceptable for an overseas flight and combined with a poorly designed seat, it led to significant back pain that lasted for the next day. I will avoid this plane (and this airline if necessary - though otherwise I like it) at all costs.",,,,,
  Seat was not functional. Crew service was very slow and poor. Food quality and overall experience poor. Flight kept delayed but nobody answered over a call for 70 minutes.,,,,,
"  There's no space, it's cramped, half of the menu options were not available, there's no entertainment system. The bathrooms are so tiny you can barely fit. It's like someone in corporate thought of every possible way to cut corners and cheapen and degrade the experience to the point where it's intolerable. No detail is spared when it comes to awfulness. The staff are fine, though and completely not their fault.",,,,,
  The air craft arrived to the destination on time. The flight was clean and food was not the greatest. The snack they provide at the last leg of the flight must have been changed to a better one( the wrap). The crew was attentive. Overall service is acceptable,,,,,
"  The flight going to LA was terrible to begin with. June 1st flight to LA was delayed by 2 hours due to lack of workers in their baggage section in Toronto. On June 4th, coming back here is even worse. The AC ground crews in LA were cranky and rude. The crew incorrectly announced that our flight was cancelled. My brother then asked why it was cancelled. The crew snapped back to say no questions asked, flight was cancelled. Surprised, we then reconfirmed with the other lady crew if our flight was indeed cancelled. The lady told us it wasn’t our flight that was cancelled but the flight next to ours which was AC792. The crew didn’t apologize for the error, instead they took our carry on luggage against our own will saying they didn’t have enough space. I told the guy if I could get something inside my carry on and he refused! My husband told him I needed to take this one important item inside and he snapped back along with the lady crew and said: “If you don’t comply, you can take the other flight which was already cancelled!” Their rudeness continued on as they speak with other passengers in line. These employees need to be reminded of common courtesy and proper work ethics when speaking to people who give them business and existence! No professionalism at all. Bad customer service. The flight attendants were very classy, considerate and courteous. Mid flight the air conditioning broke down, I almost passed out due to warm air blowing on my face, then they had to close the washroom for the entire duration of the flight! I don’t remember having a good experience with Air Canada, but this time I learned my lesson well. Never again.",,,,,
" I traveled from Dallas to Regina. On way back from Regina had to take a connecting flight in Montreal where had to pass through customs. There was so much confusion and no one from Air Canada would guide passengers properly. They were all in a cranky mood and didn’t have patience to listen and guide property. Flight was delayed for 40 minutes as we had to wait for other flights that were delayed. People were upset and complaining that staff was not at all helpful, I had planned to buy food on board but crew just gave me beverage and didn’t ask about food. I thought will ask me later but then I saw crew sitting and eating their dinner. I asked one of crew members aren’t you selling food to which he replied we asked but you didn’t want anything. I told him that is a false statement you never asked me about food. I told him that I would like to purchase food and he said we have nothing. I got upset at his behavior so a senior member came and showed me a menu. There were only two choices so I selected one. They didn’t have much food so avoided asking passengers. When I landed in Dallas I found out that I was the only person on two flights from Montreal whose luggage has not arrived. It was 12.15 am. Lady at the airport said it will come on 10 am flight but was not on that flight. Then I was told will come on 7 pm flight. I am still waiting. Very poor service with non courteous and unfriendly both ground and cabin staff.",,,,,
" Worst airline I have ever travelled on. I will never use AC ever again. The flight was delayed 3 times and then cancelled. We were re-booked the following day. They were fully aware that the flights would be delayed and made us wait at the airport from 9am to 4pm. They booked us for a night at a hotel, but were uncompensated for the cancellation. The flight on the following day was again further delayed. Airlines like this do not deserve to be operational.",,,,,
"  We were flying to Vancouver from Copenhagen via Toronto on June 1st. First they cancelled our flight then rebooked us. The flight they rebooked was then delayed by 5.5 hours in Toronto. There were hundreds of passengers stranded at the airport and only one customer service desk to service all the customers. On the way back from Vancouver to Cleveland via Toronto, the flight to Toronto was initially delayed by 2.5 hours then cancelled because of pilot shortage. They rebooked us through United and said our bags will be transferred to United but when we arrived at the gate to board the united flight we were denied boarding because Air Canada never transferred the bags over. It took them over an hour to find the bags. They rebooked the flight the second time eventually after I spent an hour and a half talking with the reservation agent and the check in agent. Both of whom kept saying that I would have to talk to the other. The fact that Air Canada is a star alliance member is mind boggling given that their customer service and flight operations are so poorly run. I can safely say I will avoid any and all Air Canada flights from now on.",,,,,
"  Absolute disaster of a company. I can't remember the last time I flew with them and didn't have a flight delayed or canceled. This time our flights from Saskatoon to Moncton via Toronto got canceled, rebooked on a late flight to Toronto and morning flight to Moncton next day. Stuck in Pearson overnight, refused a hotel voucher. Both new flights delayed. Still sitting here waiting for the flight to Moncton, been delayed about 5 times, about 6 hrs beyond what was already a lost day of our lives. I don't know why we even bother, would be cheaper and faster to rent a car and drive across the country. I would never use Air Canada again except we basically have no other choice in Canada.",,,,,
" Flight got cancelled and rescheduled after having spent 4 hours in the airplane, parked with no updates on flight status and if or when we'd take off. More than 28 hours of so called 'delay'. Very little communication or ways for them to compensate and make your journey less painful. Air Canada pay their staff poorly and treat them also poorly hence why to call this company pathetic is a compliment. Next time I might as well walk.",,,,,
 Worst airline ever! Spirit would be better - customer service is poor. 2 hour hold time! Won't help or give refund! Avoid these people! I'd rather take the bus than fly with them.,,,,,
  We arrived from Tokyo to Miami after having a layover in Canada. We asked at least 9 employees between Tokyo and Canada if we should pick up our luggage and check it back in or if there was anything we had to do in order to not have the luggage forgotten at the layover in Canada. Three of them had no idea what the proper process was and of them told us we did not have to do anything and it would ship directly to Miami. We arrived in Miami and to our surprise our luggage was not there. We then received a text message saying the following “Bag is delayed Tag # (Booking #) Expected to arrive in Miami MIA May 27 22:29 Arrange delivery here: flyac.ca” we arranged the delivery and again to our surprise the luggage is not getting to Miami until tonight and will not be delivered till 3 days later. We called to see if they would provide us with some funds to be able to purchase the necessary items needed for the time being and we’re told we would have to purchase them on our own and maybe after we could put a claim in and see if they approve it or not. We asked for a time line of how long the approval usually take and we’re refused an answer. We asked to speak to a supervisor and we’re told they do not have any supervisors that could help us and refused to put us trough to a supervisor after which they told us to hang up. When we said we would not hang up until we spoke to a supervisor they put us on hold and hung up. We are now left in a city away from home with no luggage and no resources to get the necessities we need.,,,,,
"  I booked a return ticket and today received this email for my return flight. I have always supported them and used for my business for years; however, today I received notice that my Premium Economy flight (I had already applied eupgrade to business) from Montreal to Malaga via Zurich has been changed to basic economy. How can an airline treat clients like this, they stated; ""We're sorry your itinerary has changed due to unexpected business or operational constraints on our planned flight schedule and we have automatically rebooked you on another flight.""",,,,,
"  My party of 5 booked with Air Canada to fly from Las Vegas to Vancouver and Vancouver to Sydney in October 2022. I was travelling with my elderly parents and paid more to get the premium seats with extra leg room for all persons in our party. I also chose the flights to ensure our transit and waiting times were not too long, as our party and especially my elderly parents would not cope well long transit times. In November 2022, I received notification due to change in flight schedules, our new flight and transit time in Vancouver would now be 12 hours. This would not work for us, and based on the Air Canada email I would log onto the Air Canada notification I would log onto the Air Canada website and make changes to the new flights or request a refund if the new schedule did I work. If seemed there were no other flights or information available for me to reschedule and so I wanted to cancel our flights to book with another airline, to get a refund the website said to contact Air Canada. This is when I found out there is NO WAY to communicate with Air Canada outside of Canada and the US. I searched all over the internet and only found numbers for people within Canada and US. At my wits end, I posted a message on the Air Canada Facebook. I got a response, and I explained the situation with my parents and that a 12 hours transit time was not workable for my situation, and if there were any other flights available with shorter transit times. I didn't get a response for 4 weeks, and had to continually send messages via Facebook. I informed them of the urgency and the need for a response, I requested that if flights with shorter time I wanted a refund, so I could purchase tickets with another airline. I got a response. I explained that the final leg of my flight from Vancouver to Sydney we had bought specific seats in row 18 with extra leg room, and wanted to confirm there seats were still ours. I was assured that seeing that flight and plane had not changed, so our booking and seats remained the same. I breathed a sigh of relief. All this took 2 months! Then at the end of Feb 2023, about 9 weeks before I was due to leave for my holiday, I received another notification that my flights had once again been rescheduled to the 12 hours transit schedule! I was furious and distressed and once again, had to message Air Canada to explain the situation again, and why a 12 hour transit time did not work and posed a risk to my parents health. I also requested a confirmation that our purchased seats had not changed. I got a response on Facebook and our flights were once again moved to the flights that I had been rescheduled to. They could not explain by my flights had been moved to the 12 hours transit time! Then in May 2023 24 hours before our flight was due to leave from Las Vegas > Vancouver > to Sydney I got the standard check-in email for our flights. I logged in and to my surprise, the seats in row 18 we have purchase 8 months ago were no longer our seats. We had no seats assigned let alone seats with extra leg room. On the app I got a message that if I wanted extra leg room, I would need to pay $164 per seat. The seats in row 18 were no longer available. I spent 30 minutes on hold and another 30 minutes with the person on the phone, who confimed I had purchased there seats 8 months ago, but coudln't explain these seats were no longer available.",,,,,
" I was flying from London to Cape Breton to visit family. I chose a flight with Air Canada because the connections were good - departing London at 9:20 am to Montreal, then Montreal direct to Sydney, arriving late afternoon. Very civilised. However, the flight was more than an hour late departing from London and as a result I missed my connection in Montreal. They rebooked me from Montreal to Toronto, then on to Sydney, arriving at midnight. Effectively adding eight hours to my trip. I requested a pass for the lounge to compensate for the extra time I had to spend in the airport at Montreal. I am an AC frequent flyer, but had already spent a lot of my points. I would have had enough points for lounge access if they had added on the flight from London, but they flatly refused to grant me access in spite of the trouble they had caused me. Air Canada has a LOT to learn about customer service. Besides which, the food is terrible and the service lackadaisical at best. I will avoid them in future if I can. WestJet is the better choice.",,,,,
"  Absolutely terrible. Delayed 5 hours I’m Cincinnati for a 1.5 hour flight to Toronto, causing us and 8 other passengers to miss a connecting flight to London. Horrible customer service in Toronto.  No compensation for the inconvenience when this has been a birthday trip planned for months. Hotel room in London wasted for the night. Will never let friends or family fly with this airline and will encourage anyone I walk to while traveling to completely avoid them.",,,,,
"  I fly internationally five or six times a year and recently completed a flight from Frankfurt to Vancouver on Air Canada 839. This was a fully booked flight and because we did not check in soon enough, my wife and were stuck sitting in seats 30 B and C. This row of seats had no window and where there should have been two seats the airline shoved in three, and the door to a toilet was directly beside us in an already narrowed corridor? To somehow squeeze in beside our fellow passenger seated in 30 A seat with no window we were crammed into the equivalent of a 3/4 seat with limited ability to even rest our arms during the flight. It all added up to the most unpleasant transatlantic flight I have ever been on. The bottom line? Air Canada on row 30 on this plane you need to remove a seat! This plane is designed for two seats instead of three in this row, especially with the washroom right there. ",,,,,
"  My family and I flew with Air Canada just two days ago from Sydney to Boston, with two layovers in Vancouver and Montreal.  Our flights were delayed, particularly the Montreal to Boston which was delayed by around 2 hours (making the wait 6 hours) and the food was not exactly appetising either - which isn't even the important part. The main thing I really wanted to complain about was how badly they handled our luggage. After our 24 hours of travelling, after arriving in Boston, the last thing I wanted was for us to find out, how our luggage had been stuck in Montreal. And we weren't the only ones - half the passengers on this same flight were also in the same situation. We ended up having to leave the airport with nothing other than our carry-ons which did not hold much and simply had to wait for our luggage to be delivered, hopefully early morning the next day, as they told us. However, even that would not be the case. Our luggage was told to arrive that following morning, yet it did not. We had absolutely nothing and thus our initial personal schedule was pushed back and we could not do the plans we had made. They had delayed our luggage delivery saying that it would get to our door anytime before 7PM. And so we just waited. Until they told us that it would come at 8PM. We waited once again. Later we called them to find out that they could not even contact the delivery people who were supposed to be delivering it, which we found extremely unprofessional. And just as a further note, our suitcases were apparently at Boston since that morning, yet they failed to do the simple job of delivering it at the expected time they had informed us with. Not only that, they must have left our suitcases in the pouring rain as even when we did receive our hard case suitcases, half our clothes and items were very wet and soggy which added onto how annoying this situation already was. They did not compensate, no nothing. I will not be traveling with this airline again in the future.",,,,,
  Horrible customer service. Awful Lounge and food/snacks. Need to pay for headphones. Uncomfortable seats. Did not honor Star Alliance Gold benefits (baggage allowance). ,,,,,
"  I have never been treated so badly as a customer. Although some of the attendants were friendly and kind, there was a very rude, unhelpful, entitled attendant who just seems to treat everyone is such a foul way.  Our flight time also had changed and never received an email with the update. We had issues checking into our flight 24 hours before. They seem to split up people travelling together and were spread throughout the plane with no sense of organization. All in all, during our trip we flew 5 different airlines and Air Canada was the worst experience. I will never fly Air Canada again!",,,,,
"  I didn’t mind flying Air Canada. We went from Kamloops to Toronto to Cancun. The problem was that you have to buy everything you don’t get anything free except for a drink, water or juice or pop which is fine But four hours from Kamloops to Vancouver, and buy a bag of peanuts for six dollars is not acceptable. Then we flew from Toronto to Cancun, but we didn’t get a chance to buy anything much in Toronto because we arrived at 5:30 am and there was nothing really open.  We had a really bad experience in Toronto on the way back. No Air Canada representatives would help us. We just got sent in circles continually. my friend was trying to put her vanilla for a checked bag, but all they did was make us go through security three times send us upstairs downstairs, and when they did, we had nowhere to go to check her bag we almost missed our flight, but by the grace of God, we caught it, and Air Canada held the flight only because there was a maintenance issue.  No signage nobody to help nobody directing us nobody guiding us nobody taking us to where we needed to go to check the bag. There is only two lovely ladies that helped us, and nobody else did nobody was at the customer service desk downstairs. Some lady was standing there for 15 minutes waiting for somebody and nobody was there. me and my friend would like to be compensated for the hour running we had to do going up and down three times Through security through the gates, back through security back through the Gates and for her loss of her $50 in American dollars.  There needs to be better service. I appreciate all the flight attendants all the people at the gates all the people that helped because they did their job but when we got to the airport inside the airport was a complete screwup. ",,,,,
"  This was a flight in the economy cabin and a full flight. Boarding was done by zone and proceeded very quickly and efficiently. Only thing that added to the boarding time was the inordinate amount of ""drag on"" luggage. Prior to boarding the Customer Sales and Services Agents were very proactive in getting some passengers to gate check their baggage. When boarded I found the aircraft to be very clean and the IFE was working beautifully. On board service was very professional and efficient with an excellent choice of the In-Flight Bistro, During the flight the F/A's came by with water service two or three times. The Service Manager was a real treat to talk to and very hospitable like the rest of her crew.",,,,,
"  YVR to YYJ is a very short sector of 12 minutes on average in the air. Boarding was efficient into a very clean regional type of aircraft. There was no service as this sector is short but the Flight Attendants were very helpful with ""drag on"" baggage. Deplanement in YYJ was very quick and easy as they used a aft door as well to speed the deplanement.",,,,,
"  No food or accommodation on long flights, minimal assistance and service. Terrible and expensive services for region which they cut further while increasing prices. Terrible monopoly business - would not survive anywhere else in the world.",,,,,
"  We had a slight delay at the beginning, which our pilot explained was due to air traffic control. On the flight my wife became extremely sick. We pressed the button to call for an attendant, no one ever came to check on us. When we landed we had a substantial delay, which our pilot explained was due to air traffic control. We were late to our connecting flight. While in security the first person yelled at us for being late. We were treated rudely in security. We got to our gate 10 minutes before departure. None of the attendants at the gate would talk to us, we waited several minutes and then left to find customer service instead. The customer service clerk was helpful and quickly scheduled us to the next flight to our city.",,,,,
" Just another awful experience with Air Canada. Flying from Toronto Pearson to Seattle to connect to another flight there. The flight was delayed, and kept on being delayed for close to 4hrs, by which time it was no longer necessary to travel (as I would have missed my connection). The ground staff helped me to cancel my check in and confirmed that I would no longer be flying, and I must say they were extremely helpful, and offered whatever assistance they could. However, everything from then was a nightmare. As I checked two pieces of luggage, it was not possible to retrieve it until the next day. When I returned to the airport to try and locate the bag, I was informed it went missing but the staff assured me that it did not leave the airport. I filed a missing bag report, and then followed up repeated for over a month. Granted, Toronto Pearson had experienced a severe backlog of delayed/lost luggage due to a recent storm, but then this is not helped by the fact that every time I spoke to an AC representative, I was told a different story. Only a month of following up and hoping for the best did I receive both bags back--one of which was damaged beyond repair. I should add that AC were quite responsive in processing my claim for compensation, as I needed to purchase clothing and essentials as a result of the lost luggage. And they paid back every expense (though that did take a while to process). Also, AC did compensate me for the damaged bag as well. Other than this, just another awful experience of a dysfunctional airline (though some of the staff have been quite friendly and helpful).",,,,,
" Absolutely awful planning by the staff. They haven’t done one thing to help me and my flights were delayed for 3 hours making me miss my flight and making me travel to 3 other airports. They are a disaster. I’m currently 36 hours on the planes my flight from Calgary to Edmonton is 1 hour long but instead I’m going to Vancouver, Kelowna then Edmonton with 13 hours of waiting if you have to be anywhere important make sure you plan for the delays.",,,,,
  I received an email 1 hour before the flight that the flight was canceled due to maintenance issues. They returned all the bags to us and didn't do anything for us. They said it was canceled due to weather issues (although the email said something else). They didn't provide any voucher for a taxi or hotel. My flight got postponed for 24 hours.,,,,,
 Horrible customer service who was not empathetic with my flight being cancelled and Air Canada not being able to accommodate me on a different direct flight that day. Did absolutely nothing to make up for the schedule change. Horrible. Will never fly with Air Canada again.,,,,,
"  Worst flight experience. Travelled with two small children and two car seats. When flight was booked it stated one carryon and one personal item per passenger. We took 2 carry on bags and strapped the car seats to each for more convenient transport since we had two small children in tow. When we went to get boarding passes, they told us we had to check our carryons. I told them it was our mode of transport for the car seats and they said it was policy on small full flights that all carryons be checked unless flying business class. I said can we just check at the gate if there is truly no space. Again told no. I said it would have been nice to have been told this information sooner than the day of the flight o we could have arranged for a different mode of transport for the car seats or packages them properly to check them. The first gate wasn’t too far but to get to the connecting flight it was far. We had to carry these bulky awkward car seats with no good surfaces to hold the entire trip. When we boarded the first flight and the flight attendants were closing the overhead storage compartments, they closed several empty compartments, yet we had to check our bags. Upon arrival to our destination we found that they had now lost our carry on luggage that they forced us to check in the first place. Reported that it was not there and they told us it was in our layover city and they would get it in next possible flight and deliver that evening or next day. Second day of no luggage and we are going to have to buy more diapers and toothbrushes and hairbrush and at least a change of clothes for our children. They cannot even tell us where the luggage is when we call. They are marked and scanned throughout the process so how is that not registering in the system when they enter in the id number for the tagged bags. This is not the first time we have lost luggage on a flight, but it is the first time we have not been able to get information regarding the process of retrieval. There is no good contact number to just call and file a complaint. It was an email process. This airline is in no way accommodating to family travel aside from somewhat early boarding. They give conflicting information when you do talk to a company representative, and offer no real answer as to how they are working to resolve your issue. They offer zero compensation for the major inconvenience.",,,,,
" I have had a very bad experience with Air Canada. I was flying round trip from London to Toronto late last year and they completely destroyed my luggage. After a rude encounter with the Air Canada lady at Toronto airport I had to go through months of unanswered emails and calls to try and sort out the situation. Eventually they agreed to refund me for my damaged baggage 3 months later. However, they would only send me a compensation in a Canadian bank account, which of course I don't have as I am a tourist. I explained this over multiple emails and calls, but nothing happened. I was told repeatedly to just be patient and they would contact me when they could find the time! That never happened. The voucher for the compensation expired and they never answered my demands for an alternative payment type. It has now been over 6 months and I have lost all faith. I believe they never intended to compensate me or indeed any other foreigner. I am convinced that if I was a Canadian they would have compensated me ages ago.",,,,,
"  It has been an interesting experience with Air Canada today, I had flew frequently by carrying on the same carry luggage in February 2023. I had no problem flew with porter three days ago from Ottawa to Toronto, unfortunately, I was stopped by a crew who targeted me and force me to pay the check in luggage cost rudely, and even spoke to his manager beforehand when I requested to speak to. I saw many others carrying bigger luggage than mine, they even didn’t have any problems to get into the gate! My carry on luggage is the right size and needs to push in the measurement but was considered as non compliance. My question is what’s the standard rule with Air Canada to screen luggage and passengers. I made my promise never fly with them again and caution people to be sensitive with the people who work at the Pearson airport.",,,,,
" We flew from Toronto, Canada (YYZ) to Providenciales, Turks and Caicos (BPV) for vacation. Everything was amazing the crew was easily 5 stars, we met one of the flight attendants at the gate and saw our kids looking at all the planes, she offered them to sit in the cockpit once we made it to our destination. The kids enjoyed the flight. The flight came with complimentary drinks, the food did cost extra we didn't purchase but other passengers were saying it was well worth it. The IFE had lots of options and the WIFI was very fast. The pilots made a very soft landing we deboarded in 5 minutes, we did deboard last because the pilots let the kids stay in the cockpit for a bit, they learned so much! Overall definitely fly with Air Canada had a great experience.",,,,,
"  Flight was supposed to be on Feb 24 to Manila via Vancouver. The flight was cancelled on Feb 24 (I was already checked in online), due to ""technical issues"" we flew on Feb 25 but the flight was delayed by two hours, hence, we missed our connecting flight. They re-booked us on a different airline but in economy (our seats were supposed to be Premium Economy). Tried to complain at the airport bur nobody knows anything at the desk so they gave me a pamphlet on how to claim. Then there's the retrieval of our luggage (tagged ""Priority Handling""). Nobody at Vancouver airport knows where our luggage's are to be retrieved so we lined up for two hours at luggage claim (not knowing whether we were in the right line). We asked somebody wearing uniform and holding a walkie talkie (two of them actually) - they said they will find out and walked away quickly - never came back. After two hours online we were given directions to re-book and go back to the same counter where there were more than 80 people lined up. We rebooked our flight successfully - no help from Air Canada. Returned to the line and after another 45 minutes, were able to retrieve our luggage. This was the most horrible experience in my 30 years of flying. Upon return I followed the instructions on re-claiming. After a week, Air Canada came back with claim denied because it is not within their control - ""Technical Issues"". Everything is a technical issue with this airline. Total disregard for their customers. Never again.",,,,,
"  The worst airline on the planet. They will cancel your flights, make you sleep in the airport and not refund your money after you find a competent airline to get you home. I made it home with the other airline before the Air Canada flight ever left. They will make you wait in very long line ups and then spend hours on the phone to get zero results. They do not care about their customers. ",,,,,
"  Excellent service and after support. My car seat was missing, they refunded the amount. I had issues with my flight in Toronto and they have returned hotel and other expenses. Keep up the good work.",,,,,
"  Horrible Customer service. Our first flight was delayed 6-7 hours due to “technical issues” which was going to make us miss our connecting flight, and the only other flight they could get us on was 7 hours after we land in our connecting city,  a total of 13 hours in delays and the only compensation they gave us was one, $300 MXN or ($20 CAD) voucher for food at only one restaurant for the 13 hour delay. It was almost insulting to receive that voucher. I am disgusted in the customer service and policies they claim the must  follow.",,,,,
"  Awful. We had two legs - first in a Dash-8 from SEA to YVR, then a 777-300 to LHR. Our first flight was delayed by an hour for a number of reasons. When we landed the connecting flight was already in the boarding process and we had to high tail it straight through the airport. Good job we were travelling light with carryon only - at Heathrow we passed a crowd of unfortunate travellers who had checked bags on the first leg and none of them had made it on the second flight. This included a couple whose carryon had been checked because there wasn't enough room overhead. The main leg of the journey was 9.5 hours. The legroom in economy was abysmal - I'm 5'11 and I had to put my knees in the little hard nooks either side of the seat under the next row's armrests. I was fortunate that passengers sitting each side of me were quite petite and were able to twist sideways a little for us all to fit. The entertainment system was good, although don't expect headphones to be provided by Air Canada. You can request earbuds that hurt after an hour or so of use, so make sure you bring your own nice headphones. The food was awful. I had ordered an Asian Vegetarian special meal - usually a safe bet for a bit of flavour on an airplane. It came warm on the outside and still frozen in the center. No bread or butter - it consisted of a small portion of plain cous cous, a some rice with a single cauliflower floret, and a tiny pot of tinned fruit salad. The regular meal seemed to be equally unappetising - chicken in tomato sauce. I noticed that my neighbours on the flight both left most of theirs. But at least they got a roll and a slice of cheese with their meal. I also had no drink with my meal, as they served all the special meals first before prepping the others, and they brink the drinks cart round after the regular meal cart.  The stewardess who seemed to be most in charge of things had an awful attitude with both passengers and her colleagues. Didn't see a single smile out of them the whole flight. You get a comically small bottle of water on the plane, but getting hold of anyone for another is an absolute mission. I managed to catch a stewardess as they were walking up the aisle to ask for some water, they just said that a bar service would be coming through shortly. It did, albeit an hour later, and that was the only time cold drinks were served on the flight. I also saw some poor victim get the same treatment from the other side of the aircraft - came to the galley to ask for a soda, told to return to his seat and they'd be coming through soon, which they didn't. The 2nd meal wasn't a meal, it was a small dry muffin. (That came with a salt and pepper sachet for some reason). I would avoid Air Canada like the plague. You expect better from a flag carrier, but I'd rather spend 9.5 hours on a budget short haul flight than fly AC again. Certainly the worst airline I've flown with so far.",,,,,
"  I travelled round trip from Seattle to Punta Cana via Toronto. On the way there, there were several issues. First off, seats were highly uncomfortable. Furthermore, the cushions were poorly secured, and slid around underneath you. The leg room was nonexistent. I literally could not fit my knees in front of me on the plane.  There were no power outlets or Wi-Fi on the plane. The return flight was what really set this experience apart though. Terrible seats, no leg room, no amenities. However, the airline made a mistake scheduling the flight, causing it to be 3 hours delayed. Our layover was 3 hours and 40 minutes, which meant that we would have 20 minutes to get to our gate. We contacted the airline about this, and they assured us that we would easily be able to make our connection (quote “that is plenty of time to get there”), and that they would hold the plane back a few minutes to wait for us if necessary. Upon arriving after an uncomfortable and long flight, we could not make it to the other gate in time, and they refused to hold it back for us. The airline scheduled us flights to Seattle the next day, with a layover. We were supposed to get to Seattle Sunday afternoon, but our new flight plan had us arriving late Monday evening. We then waited over 2 hours in line at a very busy and crowded Air Canada service desk. the service was incredibly slow, but eventually they told us that there were much better flights we could have got that would have gotten us home much earlier, but they sold out in the time we stood in the line. I am writing this review from the run down hotel they offered us, after having a meager dinner with the insufficient food vouchers they gave us. I fly a lot, but my entire experience with Air Canada was consistently and extremely awful.",,,,,
" Fort Lauderdale to Montreal on Air Canada. Check in was smooth and handled by a friendly and courteous agent at the Priority counter. Unfortunately things went downhill from there on. Boarding was absolute mayhem with gate agents giving conflicting instructions. To make matters worse, instead of using the zone-based queues at the designated gate, they decided to use the lanes of the neighbouring gate causing a mass migration, not to mention confusion, for some 200 passengers. The gate agents were not only unorganized they were actually surly with the passengers. In the end it became a free-for-all boarding experience. When I got on board, I mentioned the chaos at the gate to one of the agents who was not even remotely interested in hearing about it and pretty much brushed it off. We were almost 40 minutes late leaving FLL which stretched the flight duration from 3 hours to 4 gate to gate. During this time the FA’s came around with water and beverage service only once and acted as if they were doing the passengers a favour. In all my travels around the globe I have never encountered a flight crew so aloof and uninterested in doing their jobs. The hard product was decent and the IFE had a good selection of movies, music and games. The washrooms looked like they had not been tended to in weeks and they surely were not going to receive any attention from the crew operating the flight. After landing, it took almost 40 minutes for the bags to be delivered. I have travelled over 1.3 million miles with Air Canada and this one has to be the poorest experience I have had.",,,,,
"  The seats that are comically narrow for an average-sized person. I made the mistake of purchasing two round-trip tickets from Orlando to Montréal, hoping for a comfortable flight next to my wife in a two-seat row. Unfortunately, the seats proved to be too small by 2 to 4 inches for most people, and for me, almost six inches. While I am 6 feet 2 inches tall and weigh 280 lbs, I am not excessively large. As soon as the seatbelt sign was turned off, I had to stand for the entire flight until it was back on, as there was no comfort in those seats for either me or my wife. The flight attendants were indifferent to our plight. In particular, one of them kept knocking into my wife whenever she passed by. Although it was probably not intentional, my wife eventually had to change seats to avoid her. Moreover, the crew at the Orlando airport was making overlapping announcements, making it impossible to comprehend their boarding process and group numbers. ",,,,,
 Terrible airline! My direct flight was cancelled due to bad weather. Air Canada rescheduled my flight for the next day with a layover without checking if that works for me. My and my husband tried to contact Air Canada to cancel rescheduled flights but no one was answering the phone. It was not possible to get hold of anyone. I tried to dispute $427 transaction without success. Don’t use this airline!,,,,,
"  Flight late leaving YVR to Vienna via Toronto because (we were told by captain) it took too long to load bags. Although we had a layover of about 90 minutes, we were so late leaving that Air Canada canceled the flight from Toronto to Vienna and put us on a flight via Frankfurt 4 hours later. This was despite the fact that, when we landed, our our original flight was still at the departure gate. We were told that there was not time to transfer our checked luggage. Now for comparison, pretty much the exact same thing happened coming home excpt it was Lufthansa. They had a shuttle pick us up immediately on arrival at Munich (which we were flying via) and take us to departing flight. They hustled (a word that seems not to be in Air Canada’s vocabulary) and got the bags transferred. We were of course late leaving but this was made up on the long flight - something AC seems not to have considered. As a national airline it is a true embarrassment. I wish this was the first time but it is not. The last time I will fly with Air Canada.",,,,,
" The worst airline to travel with. I have had baggage issues twice with this airline. The last one was in Oct. 2022 and they still haven’t refunded me for my broken bag which was due to their negligence. They don’t even give a single cup of coffee free in their flight. When it comes to refunding, they just take you round and round and they say oh the case is being escalated. For $250 USD I have been waiting for 6 months now. Unacceptable customer service at every level..",,,,,
"  Terrible customer service, change our flight schedule from early morning to midnight. Instead of finding an option I was asked if I just want a refund. Disregard whether customers has plan on the day of arrival, or has booked a hotel or rent a vehicle, Air Canada can just change the schedule without letting you know",,,,,
  So so bad! My flight in to NYC - even though I have confirmed my ticket months ahead of time. I ended up having a standby ticket? On my way back I've had to check my carry on and wait for it at the carousel. Staff were rude! Now I hate that airline and will avoid flying with them ever again.,,,,,
 Currently sitting on runway for 1 hour. When we landed captain said it would be 5 min. How can you make people pay 1000’s of dollars and be so understaffed and unprepared. Its criminal. We are crammed in on this plane like sardines. Worst flight ever. Shameful service Air Canada!,,,,,
" This company is a complete joke. Both flights were delayed. 10 years ago, Air Canada came up with Rouge to be able to compete with a few low costs company who were supposed to be starting across Canada. 10 years later, they sell their tickets 1200$ Montreal- Miami: you get the low cost comfort and service but at a full price. Please, get rid of this awful company. Passengers are seated like animals. There is no space to move at all. The legroom is very small and the seats are not comfortable.",,,,,
" I could not believe the unprofessionalism of the cabin crew on this flight. I am frequent flyer and often do 1 or 2 round trips between North and South America per year, usually through Air Canada. This was my first Air Canada rouge experience and I hope to never have another like this again. I found it a little strange that the flight attendants stood at the door as passengers were boarding but they were not greeting anyone, just standing and watching people board. The flight was 4.5 hours from Kelowna to Toronto and it left at midnight so passengers wanted to sleep. I was shocked when I woke up partway through to the sound of loud laughing and women’s voices talking and swearing. I thought it must be passengers in a nearby row. However, I glanced toward the back of the plane and saw all of the flight attendants standing together chatting with no regard for the passengers trying to sleep. I’m sure the whole back half of the aircraft could hear them. Again, as passengers exited the aircraft, the attendants stood at the door but their attention was on each other as they continued chatting to one another and ignoring the departing guests. I’ve never seen a cabin crew act this unprofessional before. I would recommend avoid booking with Air Canada rouge.",,,,,
"  The flight was affordable and a good value for money. The service was excellent. The seats were spacious and comfortable for economy compared to other airlines. There were no screens in the seats and charging ports were tough to find as they were at the bottom of the seats. However, in flight movies through our phones was good. Along with the wifi and texting in flight for free for Aeroplan members was a nice luxury for economy. Our pilot Heather was awesome. Very comfortable take off and landing. ",,,,,
"  Ground and flight crews were excellent. Flight was efficient and comfortable. But I’ll never fly Air Canada (Rouge or otherwise) again. This was originally a BOS-YYT itinerary via YUL. 11 hrs before departure, at 23:15, we got texts that the BOS-YUL flight was cancelled. We were offered rebooking more than a day later, via Halifax with a very tight connection. We opted to DRIVE to Montreal instead and catch the original second leg, but AC had already removed us from that flight. There was no way to rebook this online, no chat, no reply to DM - only the reservations toll-free number, which I called at midnight. I spoke with an agent at 3:30 am - I was on hold for 3.5 hrs. She restored the booking, but not the seats; my wife and I were separated on the flight. We drove at 7am and caught the flight out of YUL. At the airport, we tried to find a desk that could give us info about a refund for the BOS-YUL-BOS legs. We were told that could only be done via the reservations till-free number. There was no booking desk at the airport. And still no reply to DMs. After we completed the trip and drove home from Montreal, now 9 days after the flight was cancelled - no word about the refund. So I called again , and spent two more hours on hold. The agent who finally answered said he had no idea how refunds work, they would need to pro-rate the refund. There was no way to contact them, no idea when I’d hear anything. He “resubmitted” the file to refunds dept. There’s no online chat, DMs don’t work, executives don’t reply to emails, there’s no desk at the airport and the call center is clearly understaffed. I’m clearly owed a refund for the flight they cancelled - but have no idea how much or whether I’ll see it in days or months. Nobody takes responsibility. It’s a shame, because the flight experience itself was lovely. But this airline is a mess.",,,,,
" Air Canada Rouge isn't a bad flight agency, and the flights themselves were okay. However I'm giving a low review because of how they handled our delay. We missed a flight due to delays and got stuck in the Toronto Pearson airport overnight. We had my ONE YEAR OLD nephew with us, and there were no amenities to help feed him, keep him comfortable and transport him. I tried to go to customer service to see about a hotel, and they closed the kiosk with about 30 people still in line, telling us we would have to leave the secured part of the airport to talk to customer service out there. It was awful customer service, and I didn't want to abandon my sister with a baby and all our luggage to look after while I tried to get us somewhere to stay. My poor nephew screamed all morning since he had nowhere to sleep and couldn't settle with how busy the airport was, even in the early hours of the morning. My sister had never flown before and this was an awful experience for her. It's clear that Air Canada doesn't care about their passengers and only wants money. To top it all off, from Fort McMurray to Toronto, there was a screaming child seated directly behind me who screamed the entire 4.5 hour flight, and screamed so loudly that he woke my otherwise silent nephew and made him cry. I understand that babies can't help their crying, but the caretakers did absolutely nothing to help him, and the flight attendants permitted it when this baby literally ran up and down the aisle of the air plane while screaming. This baby also stood up on his seat and pulled my hair, yet not a peep was spoken to the caretaker by the staff.",,,,,
"  On our departure from Mexico to return to Montreal, we were shocked to find that our seats were not guaranteed on our flight. In fact, when checking in at Cancun airport, we find that we don't have a seat. The letters SBY are indicated as seat. By going to ask the question to the representative of our airline company while going to carry our luggage, he tells us that we do not have a seat yet, that we are on standby and that we will have to present ourselves 10 minutes at our boarding gate before boarding begins to check with another employee of our airline to ask them for a status report. We were so frustrated with the situation and the lack of explanation from our airline. The employee didn't seem convinced that we had a seat on the plane even though we had an outward flight and a return flight when we had booked our trip to a resort in Mexico with our travel agent. Moreover, it was not our first time on a plane. We knew how it worked and we had never experienced such a situation. So we headed to our gate and waited for the right moment. Even when it was time to go see the employee at the boarding gate, she didn't seem to know what to say other than ""probably the system"" Finally, my partner and I were called to the gate and finally got seats on the plane. So imagine, arriving at the airport and learning that your seats are on standby. First time in my life that I have lived this! Also, it was not the first time we had flown with this airline. On the other hand, positive point, all the flight attendants on the outward and return plane were very nice and professional. Nothing to say on this side! Unfortunately, our experience with the airline was extremely disappointing. Our travel agent did not understand why we did not have a seat on the return plane.",,,,,
" Flew Air Canada Rouge twice this week. Booked thinking I was flying Air Canada. Knew nothing about the “rouge” brand. Both flights were delayed. They did not have sufficient time between flights to properly move planes or service them. Both flights were delayed. So 100% chance of delay. Rude staff who will cut the customers needing extra time off. The flight attendants made a guest put two bags below their seat so they could accommodate one guest who wouldn’t find her own open bag spot. Very rude service. First flight, boarded an hour late then sat for an hour waiting to push back as they didn’t have weights to fly. No offer of drinks or anything.",,,,,
"  They will take you to where you need. Nevertheless, in the months before the flights we had a few time changes. At the airport we had to show vaccination records four times despite the fact that we uploaded it to their app. The boarding zone system is confusing and separating family members. On the way back there was an hour delay from Narita and a gate change in Montreal. Now there is another delay in the transit to Newark. I paid for wifi from Japan to Canada and it didn't work. ",,,,,
"  One of the worst experiences of my life. Our first flight after the pandemic to visit family for Christmas. We purchased these tickets 4 months ahead for our family of 4 as Christmas presents, so we could all go and relax and enjoy family time. The night before our flight we could only check in my husband and myself, it was giving us a note that we needed to come see someone at the counter upon arriving to the airport. We went very early the next day, try to check in our daughters again and the same notice came up. So we went to find out what the issue was and a guy at customer service very rude and unpleasant, notify us like nothing that the two tickets for our daughters were sold out to their own staff. I could NOT understand what was happening at the same time and why would they do that to tickets that were already paid 4 months ahead of time. Anyways after arguing and actually crying we had to leave our two daughters behind waiting there to get accommodations for the next day on the evening. With the loss of two days of their flights and my agony as a mother we left them behind. Because they could not accommodate all of us on the same flights now because everything was sold out. We wrote to Air Canada a complaint and the excuse was because of the weather their flight was delay. Not knowing that we already knew that the tickets were re-sold to accommodate their own employees. I will never like to use their service again. That was cold, calculated, irresponsible and lack of respect and responsibility to their customers",,,,,
 Flying two adults and a toddler. Summary of my experience: 12 hours waiting at the airport getting messages every hour that my flight was delayed. Cancelled flight at 10 pm and Air Canada did not offer a hotel. No meals offered. Customer service did not answer the phone. No one available to discuss my issue.,,,,,
"  Likely the worst airline experience I have had, outbound YYZ to PHX on Dec 15, 2022 Air Canada suggested that we arrive at YYZ at least 3 hours before AC 1721 for a 9:25 departure, so we staggered in at about 6:15. At 7:23 the flight was delayed until 9:20 We then boarded the plane and waited on the tarmac for about an hour. Then we were ordered off the plane and told to take everything with us. At 10:14 the flight was delayed until 12:30. Gate agent scolded passengers because someone had used the plane's lavatory while it was on the ground, and apparently that was the cause for the delay. As if it's the first time in the history of air travel that someone used the plane's toilet before it left the ground. At 10:30 the flight was delayed until 1:30 At 11:25 the flight was cancelled and we were re-booked on AC 1723. Our seats were separated by 14 rows. No refund for premium seat selection that was denied because of the cancellation At 2:26 there was a gate change At 4:17 there was another gate change At 5:21 that flight was delayed until 8:15 Wheels-up after 9 pm. We arrived at our destination about 12 hours late. Compensation offered? A $10 meal voucher. I have travelled all over the world, and dealt with scores of airlines and hundreds of airline personnel. I have never met with such rudeness and condescension as I have with Air Canada Rouge. Worst Airline Experience Ever",,,,,
"  First time flying the 737 MAX and I cannot say I was impressed. The seat configuration is terrible. Misaligned with windows. The aisle is narrow, felt sorry for the attendants serving food and drink. The bathroom was terrible, a person of size would have problems entering. The overhead compartments are of better design. We sat in preferred and the seats have virtually no padding what so ever. The flight itself went fine and the onboard service was excellent.",,,,,
"  The queueing to board is haphazardly organized whenever I fly Air Canada, but overall I have no criticisms. Our seats, 21A/C, had really excellent legroom with a lot of room in the footwell and a clean window. There was no seatback TV, but instead a really handy clip to hold your iPad. Service is PAYGO, so it is a bit intrusive when they're selling food, and the seats could stand to have a bit more padding, but for a domestic transcon flight it was quite good enough for 4-5 hours and I would not hesitate to book again. Baggage was handled properly with no issues.",,,,,
" Horrible! Would never use this airline again! They lost the luggage of 30 passengers (including me). Said that unfortunately they forgot to board the luggage on the flight. I'm still waiting for my luggage 3 days later, with no clothes, no medicine (that I need to use daily) and no answers! Horrible customer service, horrible service! Never again!",,,,,
"  Cancelled our flight two days before a hurricane was anywhere nearby citing bad weather, meanwhile Air Transat and other liners continued to fly passengers out on the exact same route for the next few days no issues whatsoever. Air Canada left us stranded and to fend for ourselves, offering absolutely nothing but an apology email. To further aggravate our desperate situation our local AC representative, asked us to wait an additional day for more information from him before securing a spot in a hotel for an extended stay. Unbelievably, the essential information that we were waiting for was that we're out of luck and that it was not his problem. As you can imagine by the tone of this review, we are still trapped in the Dominican riding out a hurricane that has only just begun to touchdown. Hoping and praying to fly out in two days, unless they cancel that flight as well. The credit card can only take so many extended bookings.",,,,,
"  Traveled Air Canada rouge from Bridgetown to Toronto and back to BGI. To YYZ was not bad as there was just a slight delay. On the way back to BGI the staff was not understanding as I was traveling with medication and the scales were off as I had to use 2 different scales that gave different weights and I had to move around items and was advised I would have to pay $100 cad for 1lb of overweight. The staff were rude and very nonchalant about it. I requested fragile stickers for my luggage my luggage was brand new and there were a few items in my luggage that could break. When I received my luggage a it was dented and a wheel was off. I'm quite appalled by the service received as ticket price were extremely expensive seeing the space given for seating and no entertainment, having to pay for wifi and even water.",,,,,
"  Air Canada rouge told me that I can’t carry my instrument like that for security purposes and refused to hear anything I had to say. The staff told me that I didn’t register my instrument and refused to listen to me when I tried to tell him that I did (my instrument even had an Air Canada tag on it). I specially checked on each airport to be sure that I will have no issue. He threatened to take me out of the plane and acted with authority if I refused to cooperate with his plan of inserting my acoustic musical instrument between hard cases in the compartment above the seats. There were 4 empty seats in front of me under which I could have inserted my instrument securely. Staff simply cut all communication canals, inserted my instrument in the worst possible place, and told me Air Canada is not responsible for any damage. I will do anything to avoid this plane next time I will travel from Quebec. ",,,,,
"  They make you check your bags for a fee of 30 USD plus fees. Hence no traveller wants to pay this fee, and you therefore have 130+ people bringing on a carry on suit case. There simply is not enough room. Customers getting frustrated with one another when people move bags without asking. We left late due to the debacle of trying to find room for these bags. Not good when we are already going to be arriving back into Toronto after 11.30pm. Then they ask you take anything that is not a wheely suitcase and put it by your feet, which serves to only reduce the meagre leg room provided on these flight. What with zero entertainment and wifi that we have to pay for, I will never travel this airline again. Air Canada you should be ashamed that you operate this service showing your name. ",,,,,
"  I flew to Canada with Akr Canada from Ft Lauderdale, USA on September 1, flight number is AC 1605 and departure time was 15.05 and the check in crews were very rude. They denied access to my carry on so I had to check it in and it had many valuables inside. Once I was in the plane, I realized my carry on will fit with no problem and plane was not full and many overhead bins. I have been traveling everywhere to Europe etc and they never denied my carry on and I know this is pure discrimination. The guy that worked that day was the worst and I am so sorry I didn't ask his name. While people were in line he walked toward the line and checked every passenger suitcases that were in line to lift and weigh them with his arms to figure out whether they were heavy enough or not and I never seen such thing like that my whole life traveling across continents. Air Canada you treat customers that are not Canadians like we flew for free. We paid for tickets. The same guy that denied my carry on insisting on that was too big. Once in the cabin, I have seen similar suitcases that were like mine.",,,,,
"  Air Canada is the worst airline I have ever flown with. My family of four flew to Athens, Greece from New York and Chicago with a connection at Toronto. In addition to long delays, Air Canada forced us to check in our carry-ons. One of my son's suitcase never made it to Greece. Ten days later and we have no word about where the suitcase is. At the beginning we were told that the suitcase went to Paris but its traces got lost after that. The customer service is horrible. We spent many hours trying to call an Air Canada number we were given but nobody answered the phone after waiting on the line for over one hour at a time. Air Canada ruined our vacation. We will never use this airline in the future. Stay away.",,,,,
" Madrid to New York via Toronto. Air Canada has the worst customer service and - well, service in general - of any airline I've ever flown on. Countless delays followed by several cancelled flights, no help from ""customer service"", non-existent support when you try to call and make contact. I could go on and on and on. Plus good luck trying to get reimbursed for their incompetence. This is basically a criminal organization masquerading as an airline. Avoid at all costs.",,,,,
"  Booked and paid for Premium Economy seats, but due to their wrong rows numbering, got regular seats. Food was no different from other passengers. So the Premium is simply a scam. The flight attendant was rude. She likely missed the class how to be courteous and how make passengers feel good. I am a frequent traveller so I am qualified to say Air Canada is from far, my worst flying experience ever.",,,,,
" Unfortunately here to share a negative experience with Air Canada. I flew out from Toronto (YYZ) to Fort Lauderdale (FLL) on June 22, 2022, Flight 1628. To begin with, as sprawling as Pearson Airport is the signage is lacking and honestly not clear at all, so it was extremely confusing to figure out exactly where we needed to go just to check in for our specific flight. Air Canada's ground customer service was painfully slow and inefficient - I get there are staffing shortages with the pandemic aftermath, but this was a little excessive. Our flight boarded a few minutes behind schedule which wasn't the end of the world, but we were scheduled to take off at 4.45pm and did not take off until almost 7.00pm! All of us literally sat on the tarmac going nowhere for over 2 hours! The cabin crew was essentially clueless and the pilot kept giving one excuse after another for the delay which didn't even make sense. Every passenger was pretty agitated about the situation, to say the least...we finally took off way behind schedule and did not make it into Fort Lauderdale until almost 10.00pm (original landing time was 7.45pm). The flight itself was OK. At least on AC Rouge, I found the legroom to be mediocre, and the seating marginally comfortable. Flight attendants were generally polite, but not necessarily friendly. Overall, this is my second experience flying Air Canada. My first time was in 2015 going to/from Montreal and I also dealt with poor customer service then, so I should have learned my lesson, but I hope this cautions other potential fliers to avoid Air Canada if at all possible - especially if your travel plans are not flexible or if you need to catch a connecting flight!",,,,,
"  Worst experience ever. They kept changing the flight time, we had to over go a delay of one hour and when we finally got to the airport we waited for an extra one hour because there was another plane in our spot. Not recommended.",,,,,
  Quebec to Montreal. Multiples change and revised time because of technical issue.  Never again will I use Air Canada Rouge or Air Canada if I have other choice.,,,,,
 Toronto to Montego Bay. Horrible airline. Only airline that’s still priced with the market and they have NO power outlets. No snacks at all even on a 4 hour flight. Flight attendants seemed stressed. Would never use again if another airline was available. Disappointed at the corners they cut.,,,,,
"  Worst flight ever! First off no entertainment at all not even charger port not even a usb plug.! The seat was so uncomfortable and I had a preferred seat? I was sore all over from that flight. The snack part annoyed me, when am flying to Jamaica with a air bistro voucher it's a meal and 2 snacks but, when am flying back to Toronto it's a meal and 1 snack for the same price. I am in shock that any sun destination you pick with Air Canada you're stuck with Air Canada Rouge. Absolutely terrible. The staff was cold and stand offish. Never again will I fly this airline.",,,,,
"  Worst airline ever. Before our flight they said there is technical issues in the airline I have record of that site was showing too. Then an other issue then weather problem finally they called cancelled flight. I got rebooked again through Expedia, now I am at New York, no one knows where is my checked in luggage.",,,,,
"  The flight to arrive to Tampa was great. The flight back to Toronto was horrible. The seats weren't in great shape, no chargers for phones. Very outdated. Thankfully I charged my phone at the airport while waiting. There was also so many carry on bags from other passengers that I was a unable to pack my carry on in the proper area of the plane. Maybe counting stowed carry on bags should be implemented. Also, I know this is common but the back of the plane should be boarded first I’m confused why this isn’t a thing. Waiting in lines for people to put their luggage up and hitting every other passenger on the way to the back of the plane. Rough.",,,,,
 Toronto to Holguin. If you want to ruin your vacation and not get the compensation you can choose Air Canada. This if the right company to help you with it. Also you will have a lot of troubles to get in touch with reps to try to resolve any problems with either Air Canada or Air Canada Vacation. I will never ever use this company again.,,,,,
"  My initial Jazz flight July 23 left 2hours late from Vancouver, which lead to missing my connection to Tampa with United. After 2 hours in the United airlines customer service line up, I was informed that there was nothing that United could do because Air Canada was in control of the ticket and they were the only ones that could rebook me on the next flight. This has to be the WORST policy because there was not an air Canada agent anywhere in the Denver airport to be found. I had no idea how to get this problem solved. After and exhausting search, I was so distraught that I left the secured area and after more attempts to find an air Canada agent I went to the United Airlines check in counter. The United agent (Carol Ann) went above and beyond to help me and while she was on hold with Air Canada she was busy checking in customers for a departing flight. She finally was successful in being able to provide me with a boarding pass onto a flight leaving to Tampa the following morning. How is it possible that United Airlines can be an alliance (partner) when they do not have authority to get Air Canada passengers where they are booked to go when the passenger has an existing boarding pass. If passengers who find themselves in this situation are supposed to know to call air Canada, then that is also a poor policy. I do not roam with my phone and certainly not going to pay for cell minutes to hold for Who knows how long? ",,,,,
"  I asked for a refund for unnecessary costs incurred on July 9, 2021. The original flight was scheduled for July 8, 2021 and I had obtained a COVID test on July 6th which was negative. The fight from West Palm Beach to Washington was delayed about one hour and a half due to bad weather and therefore the connection to Toronto was missed by a few minutes. The notation on the display boards indicated that it was still boarding but it had departed by the time I got to the gate. I feel that the airlines must know that there are people wanting to connect on any fight and know which flights are delayed and which flights are arriving, therefore could have waited about 15 minutes to half an hour longer. A United Airlines customer service representative confirmed me on the earliest flight possible to Toronto which was the next day at 4:30 p.m. Was that the first possible flight with any airline or any connection? SO I had to stay at a hotel in the Dulles area from July 8th to July 9th. When I got to the Air Canada check in the next day I was still within the 72 hour limit for the COVID test and the attendant told me that they went by the flight departure time - which I had no control over - which was 4:30 p.m. a time difference of only a few hours. SO I had to take a RAPID COVID TEST which cost $250 U.S. at the Dulles airport right then. Since the world has been battling this pandemic for over a year now, there has been a practice of quarantining for 14 days as the virus take 14 days to be established. Therefore why would another test on July 9th, show anything but a negative result? I now have paid close to $500 U.S. for the two tests with a last vaccination date of April 1, 2021. I do not want to pay this extra $250 simply because the person at the check-in was young and overly officious, and making a capricious and arbitrary decision. They are refusing to offer me a refund of $450 Canadian for the hotel stay on July 8th and a second Covid test on July 9th.",,,,,
"  My husband and I had a return flight to Montreal on january 14. For personal reason we needed to cancel our flights . Air Canada employee Alberto Colagrosso took care of cancelling our travel arrangements. He was courteous and efficient. With these difficult times which we are going through, people tend to be very impatient however Mr. Colagrosso was very patient and understanding. Thank you Air Canada for hiring competent employee.",,,,,
"  I have to say having flown Air Canada rouge a handful of times (international, trans-border), I haven't had a negative experience with their Premium Rouge ('business class') product. The latest flight was a return leg from Montego Bay (AC1805) to Toronto, the aircraft was two years old, and extremely clean, obviously. Crew were professional, friendly and accommodating. F&B quality and service was excellent. A very pleasant travel experience during very trying times.",,,,,
"  I make a round trip flight to South America at least 2x per year. When AC Rouge first started, I loved flying with them. Then they upgraded their planes with thinner seats and less recline, (unfortunately most airlines have made this upgrade).  I find it rather ironic that they did this, when every study on air rage, shows that more comfort (aka more leg room and seat recline), reduces stress and air rage. So they did the exact opposite of what every study said they should do. So not only have they made a long haul flight, less comfort able, the prices have also been steadily creeping upwards, (I used to buy first class for what you now pay in premium economy). As a whole, the cabin crew has always been great to me, but you always get the odd one who may be having a bad day and are a bit more abrasive. When Rouge first started flying, I never had an issue with missing or delayed baggage. The last 4 flights I have had missing/delayed bags. In summery, AC Rouge is a typical low cost carrier that cuts costs where they can. They used to be exceptional, but now they are below average. ",,,,,
"  We were on holiday visiting both Toronto and Las Vegas. It's not often you get to fly on a 767 in Europe anymore and I was looking forward to this trip on one even though I know they are showing their age. The airport in Toronto was efficient and relatively quiet and it was good that we could do the US immigration pre-clearance there. Boarding was quite fast given the number of people. But after we boarded the cabin crew had to work very hard to find hold space for all of the carry-on bags which led to frustrated passengers and the plane was uncomfortably hot while all this was going on. The 767 did look old and a bit tatty but actually my seat was comfortably and I nodded off and before long we were in Vegas. I thought the flight was good value for money given the distance we were covering - nearly 2,000 miles I think. Baggage arrived quickly in Vegas airport too.",,,,,
"  I'm writing this on behalf of my mom and dad, who had a trip booked to Vancouver from Las Vegas. Unfortunately, a month before the trip date, they weren't able to fly anymore due to my mother's stage 4 cancer diagnosis. There was no compensation given for the canceled flight. Not a credit. ",,,,,
  Winnipeg to Punta Cana via Toronto. Me and my family have flown many times on Air Canada and Air Canada rouge but this has to be the best time ever. When we left Winnipeg the flight attendant noticed that my mother has trouble walking so she talked to the ground staff in Winnipeg who then called Toronto and arranged a wheel chair for her when we landed to get us to our next flight. We could have made it on our own but the compassion and care that this flight staff gave to us really made our whole family’s day.,,,,,
"  Toronto to Phoenix. 8:55 a.m. departure on AC 1836. 90 Minute delay originally posted. Then we get on plane actually go through de-icing and then we are told the lavatories don't work and we need maintenance. Back to the terminal. Then we are told we all have the right to deplane after ages on the tarmac. Final announcement is that we all need to deplane as the pilots have gone over time. We get off plane and are only told the plane will leave at 2 p.m. (originally an 8:55 a.m. flight). We were told our tickets served as vouchers for food. This actually worked, but in the end we are delayed 6.5 hours headed to a long weekend getaway in Phoenix - lost a complete day at resort but resort still wants its daily fee. We are offered nothing else yet the Passengers Bill of Rights should allow some compensation for delays over 5 hours that are the fault of the airline.",,,,,
"  We were flying back from Orlando to Toronto, originally boarding time 4:10pm and scheduled to land before 8pm. We received multiple notifications about flight delays, each time saying it will be delayed approximately 1 hour. notifications kept coming as we waited with uncertainty, until finally it states plane would arrive at approx. 1:15am. At one point, after 11pm, it seemed like they were trying to genuinely expedite things for us, saying flight will arrive in 30 minutes and do quick turn around. 30 minutes later, another delay saying have to wait for 2 flight attendants to come in, 30 minutes away. another 30 minutes later, they said they are waiting for another attendant to come in, about 30 minutes away! Feels like just making excuses and in the end, boarding time remained unchanged at 1:15 approx. We were not offered any vouchers for meals. Once plane arrived, gate attendant did not show any sympathy regarding the passengers' frustration, but rather demanded and threatened that attendants be treated respectfully and politely, otherwise would turn plane around and none of the passengers will board. Gate attendant was rude, ignoring our questions and requests. If people are not completely frustrated by now, then I can't think of a better way to agitate everyone. Finally arrived back at Toronto around 4:30. after picking up luggages and passing customs, arrived home at 5:30. Unfortunately, had to go to work exhausted. Overall, extremely bad experience. ",,,,,
  Toronto to Fort Lauderdale. Wonderful service provided on Flight 1626 on March 1st. Blair and Freedom really went out of their way to make sure the passengers had an enjoyable flight. After a delay of over an hour the passengers were getting a bit angry but these flight attendants really worked hard to keep their passengers happy and smiled all the way through it!,,,,,
"  I have a complaint about cabin announcements made on AC Rouge Flight 1659 Tampa to Toronto on Feb 16, 2020. Safety and advisory oral messages were given at garbled high speed, heavily accented and were next to unintelligible to me. Cabin communications must be clearly enunciated, at a moderate speed and presented in a serious manner.",,,,,
"  I was a bit wary about flying Air Canada Rouge. Numerous comments and reviews and without question the majority of those comments / reviews were negative. I flew from my home in Kelowna (central B.C.) to Edmonton then to Toronto on an A321. I was pleasantly surprised by this aircraft, spotlessly clean and the seating (I was in regular economy for this part of my trip ) was spacious and comfortable. The cabin crew were delightful, quite young and very friendly and efficient, service was very good. The next part of my trip was Toronto to Glasgow, an evening flight on an older Boeing 767, I was in premium economy. There was a separate cabin for premium economy, I had two large seats to myself. The food was excellent, a lovely meal served with a nice imported red wine, service was top class, well done ladies! On these older 767's there is no in flight entertainment, that is simply an issue that you should be aware of prior to booking. I knew that so I downloaded a couple of good movies from Netflix to my tablet and I had a good pair of comfortable headphones. I sat back and enjoyed the flight, had a couple of nice highballs and then a couple of hours nap before landing in Glasgow. All in all an enjoyable experience flights were right on time, if there was anything negative it was landing in Glasgow at 6.30 in the morning. My return flight was Glasgow to Heathrow then on to Vancouver in premium economy again top notch. I'm away again this September to Glasgow, my travel agent found me a very good fare with Air Canada in premium economy.",,,,,
"  Ottawa to Tampa. Absolutely the worst experience flying with any airline. Seats so tight together that my sore arthritic knees were forced up against the seat in front of me. The tray table if I had been able to use it would have hit me in the chest. I have been flying since I was 5 years old and so I have 55 years experience when I say that flying has never been so uncomfortable. Top this off with the rudeness we were met with everywhere we turned, especially at check in at the Air Canada counter in Ottawa. Rude, impatient and dismissive treatment. It was truly a horrible experience. Because of the lack of space it was very warm and made us feel claustrophobic. The passengers on the flight kept getting out of their seats as a result. My husband was hit by the cart each time it went by. We are people not cattle.",,,,,
" Toronto to Bogota. Do you like waiting on a stationary plane for hours and hours? Are you allergic to water, food, and other simple luxuries? Do you hate getting to a hotel that you've already paid for the day after you were supposed to? If you answered yes to these questions, then boy, do I have an airline for you!",,,,,
" Toronto to West Palm Beach. I have flown AC for a few weeks now and noticed they have no on-time arrival statistics because they are continually late. There are tremendous inefficiencies at the gate and on boarding crew, they are not helpful at all. They smile and speak two languages but that does not assist passengers trying to figure out where to put their luggage when there is no room left. Their website is difficult to navigate and the link to Aeroplan is less than stellar. They also are not very accommodating making sure folks stay hydrated in the air. Trying to call or electronically communicate forget it, no answer. Unfortunately, the price of the tickets is no different than any other airline. It does show when there are no regulations and big corporations like Air Canada can do what they want and treat their customers any way they choose. Sometimes a little regulation goes a long way. There are no watchdogs on this airline!",,,,,
"  Toronto to Belize, delayed by 48 minutes. The flight attendants were rude to me. We were told to get our own alcoholic beverages from the back of the plane when asking for a refill. On our second flight there was no beer on a 5hour flight. Our 4 flights with Air Canada during our vacation was delayed or rescheduled. The airline overbooks flights and then asks people to wait until the next day to fly out. ",,,,,
"  Almost all the AC staff were subpar in their customer service treatment. I remember asking for a tissue on the way back as I was quite sick and the air hostess said she would help after serving the food. So I waited and nothing. I didn't bother reminding her again. I used the restroom. Later on during the flight I had a question and pressed the button and nothing. I understand staff get busy and that's no problem. However, I pressed that button over 5 times throughout the flight and not a single host came to address my inquiry. From the moment we tried to board until the very end, there wasn't a single rep I could give a shout out to. The attitude was aggressive and arrogant. A little mindfulness goes a long way and the staff in my opinion need to significantly up their game. The job isn't merely to serve food on the plane but to make sure all travellers are respected and responded to with basic kindness.  Of course this is just my one such experience; there may have been others out there who've had a pleasant experience with this airline. ",,,,,
"  
Toronto to Orlando. We had a bad experience on our previous AC flight back in April 2019. We paid extra to have bulkhead seats on our flight to Orlando. Gate agent came up to us after we were seated and demanded that I vacate the seat I paid for to allow a teen with a broken leg to sit on the bulkhead aisle. Didn't even ask. He said one of us had to move. Rude and condescending was what I got for refusing to do so, and a warning that I could be removed from the flight with MY attitude. Fast forward Jan 2020, and again I find myself on an AC Rouge flight. The attendants are snappy and rude when I ask for water before the aircraft begins to taxi. Rude is what I got when an attendant took my back pack out of the overhead bin to allow a late arrival's small suitcase to be put in its place. Now I have to sit with my back pack at fit, on a tiny seat, with tiny leg room, because the late women's suitcase is bigger. Never again wil I fly Air Canada. I will happily pay extra to fly a better airline, or fly out of Buffalo. BTW, I'm still waiting for my water.",,,,,
" Toronto to Honolulu. I was threatened of cancellation 3 times and had to re-purchase my ticket each time thanks to some flawed algorithm the airline uses. I received emails stating that it was potentially a fraudulent purchase, and I needed to come to the airline in person to show ID, otherwise, I would be cancelled within 48 hours prior to travel. I was not refunded any money either, just informed of this. Because I was traveling with a young child and a party of 4 others, I had no choice (otherwise I'd have bought another ticket with a different airline). I drove 2 hours out of my way in order to do this, and when I got to the airport the Air Canada representative told me I had to repurchase the tickets. I told him I was not refunded, and he insisted that ""the money was on its way."" This was 3 weeks ago, so essentially I paid double for my tickets and had to drive way out of my way in inclement weather to do so. This is the worst airline ever - unethical, irresponsible, and fraudulent.",,,,,
"  Lima to Toronto. Not sure why we deserved a budget airline service when travelling on such a long cross-continent flight. We had a snack and a meal included. The planes are dated, no way to set your own temperature. Tiny overhead cabin storage and small seat pitch. Entertainment was on your own device, which was not clear when booking or checking-in. The ground service was horrendous. At check-in where we were quizzed on our trip to Peru (despite leaving and heading to Canada) with questions designed to trip us up and stickers placed on the passports with sellotape and we were told to never remove them.  We were submitted to random patdowns and bag searches at the departure gate, delaying the flight. Apparently this was at the request of Canadian security services (although we saw it set up at gates for US-bound flights too) but it was odd and when happening at 3am local time, quite disorientating.",,,,,
"  Toronto to Montego Bay. Morning flight, delayed by an hour. Premium Rouge class, seat 1A, was better than I was expecting. Decent leg room, breakfast consisting of fruit and oatmeal tasty, and cabin staff friendly and attentive. Compared to my return leg via WestJet Premium, Rouge Premium was a close second. Would consider a second trip with them although I won’t recommend to others due to an over abundance of negative reviews - and I think I may have just got lucky. I’d need some further travel using Rouge.",,,,,
"  Got my round trip flight to Tampa from Toronto through Hotwire. They offered me one free checked bag plus one carry-on for the trip. Air Canada did not honour the offer. I had to take only one carry-on luggage. In Toronto they checked in my carry–on luggage for free as the airplane was full. In return flight, they charged me $24 US for the same luggage while they were announcing the airplane was full and they did check in all carry-on luggage free of charge! We had 2:30 hours delay in Toronto to Tampa and 35 minutes delay in Tampa to Toronto.",,,,,
" The whole process from start to finish was a nightmare. 1) First of all I thought I had Pre-booked my seats for this flight and wanted to confirm with Air Canada. I tried to call in to Air Canada and after 2 hours of waiting on hold I gave up. 2) 24 hours later I was able to book my seats and found I was sitting in a middle seat on the 27th row. I always want to sit close to the front and sit in an aisle. I was very upset and could not change it. 3) Getting to the airport they would not accept my pre registered booking as my husbands middle name was put backwards (first and last name was correct.) We tried to register on the machines but it would not issue a ticket for my husband. We had to wait over 1 hour in a line up to get our ticket. 4) From there we had to run through security and terminals to get there just in time to board. 5) We finally got onto a cramped Rouge plane filled with crying children all around us. So cramped you could hardly get through the passage. In truth I felt like a cattle of animals. There was barely room for your legs. Food and drinks were non existent until the last 40 min of the flight. This was truly one of the worst trips I have taken. WestJet in my opinion offers better service, leg rooom and comforts. I think it’s time to up the ante. I fly approx 12-14 times a year and this honestly was one of the worst flights I ever had.",,,,,
"  Miami to Toronto. It was our family's last day of vacation in Miami Beach and our rental car was broken into and our cash, credit cards, bank cards, DL's, iPads taken. The only saving grace was our passports were not taken. After hours of sorting things out with the Miami PD, insurance and the bank we had $0 and still many hours to go before our flight. I thought we'd be alright without any money until we got home. Then we went to the airport, go to check in at the electronic kiosk which included our 1 check in bag which cost $22US, I had forgotten about that cost. I went up spoke to the Air Canada rep and explained the situation. I offered to pay the following day if possible, I made no progress with her so asked to speak with her supervisor. She went away and came back and passed along the following message from her supervisor. Her final answer, ""Sorry, there is just nothing we can do. You will just have to leave your suitcase here. You can just take your stuff out of the suitcase and wear what you can."" I asked to speak with the supervisor and was told she was busy on the phone and while we waited for her to come out another passenger who overheard our situation offered to pay for our checked in luggage. These actions make a difference that you just cant explain, such a thoughtful gesture from some really incredible people. I will be paying this forward tenfold. ",,,,,
"  I have flown this segment (TOR-Victoria) a number of times. I used to commute Toronto to London, UK and typically paid less for that flight segment (even buying less than a week’s notice). This Rouge plane isn’t fit for purpose: seats are falling apart, no legroom, no food (5 hour flight?), no screens, we bus out to the tarmac from AC’s hub at Pearson, the plane never leaves on time - the entire experience is borderline - criminal. I’d love to see ACs CEO saddle up for this experience in economy. The least he could do is put a proper plane/gate on the route.",,,,,
"  Toronto to Barcelona. Purchasing the tickets was a complete nightmare. The website kept getting errors and I could not book the dates I wanted. Customer service helped me over the phone advised they apologized and because of the Mishap they would place me in a better seat free of charge with extra legroom. I am in the plane right now. If your guessing I don't have extra legroom you're right. I also never ended up getting the dates I wanted because the representative kept getting the same error as I got initially. Fast forward to the airport. Get on the plane,  no entertainment.  Pay for Wi-Fi or use their App is the entertainment. I went online, took out my gift card, and it turns out they don't accept their own gift card. Whatever, I pay. They bring the food that is included. It's not good at all.  I wait for someone to come to ask if I want anything else. No one for about and hour and a half. So I press the service button on the elbow rest. No one came for another roughly 20 minutes. I get up and walk all to the back of plane and ask for Their meal combo. Turns out they don't have combos on international flight.  They don't have any additional food on this flight except for chips. I buy anyway, because there's another 5 hours left and I have a gift card... but they don't accept their own gift cards for food either. So it's basically useless now with the remaining balance.... How am I going to spend 120 remaining on a gift card if I can only use it for plane tickets? I only have 6 months to use it or lose it. ",,,,,
" Toronto to Honolulu. Do not use this airline. They cancelled me 3 times, sending me an email saying it had to do with ""fraud alert"" and that I had to purchase the ticket in person at an Air Canada kiosk, which is 2.5 hours from my home. I repurchased the ticket with another credit card, even though the former was fine and it should have gone through, and 3 days later it happened again. I will never fly with Air Canada rouge again. ",,,,,
" Toronto to Miami. My wife and I had 1 backpack carry amongst the two of us. We were asked to remove it from overhead storage and put it under our seats. I had shoes and towels stored in the backup making it bulky. I could not sit comfortably throughout the flight. When quizzed as to why other travellers with large and heavy carryons were given first priority - the attendant said that was just the case. It is brutal that we were penalized for choosing to pack lightly. Furthermore, we have seen multiple smaller backups and handbags stored in the same bins. I cannot say why our bag was removed. Atrocious!",,,,,
"  Toronto to Venice. No TV or in-seat entertainment. Poor meals for me. Clogged sink in the restroom. Small space for luggage. I was expecting more, I am very disappointed definitely will try to avoid flying with Air Canada rouge in the future.",,,,,
"  Toronto to Orlando. I tried to checkin today for my wife and I and found out that they had put us in separate rows even though we booked these tickets 3 months ago. I called and they wouldn’t move us even though there were two emergency seats open. This occurred after they notified us 2 months ago that our flight home was cancelled and we had to choose a different flight. No apologies, no solutions, no customer service, just the arrogance of Air Canada.",,,,,
" I would like to express my gratitude for some outstanding customer service I experienced from ground crew from Las Vegas to Vancouver. I am an 80 plus-year-old lady that was not looking forward to all of the walking and stress of going through customs when we reached Vancouver. I was blown away with the attentive ground staff that whisked me through customs and made it so enjoyable and so stress-free, thank you so much for your assistance. Happy Thanksgiving to you all.",,,,,
" I will write this review as honest, and fairly as I possibly can. By far, Air Canada Rouge is the worst airline I have flown in years. Even compared to other countries ultra budget airlines, AC Rouge sets the standard for negligence and incompetence. I will elaborate, on a beautiful October day, flight from Toronto to Calgary was originally scheduled to leave at 12.30pm ET. It left well over 2.5 hours later. The first aircraft at the gate was delayed by 30 mins due to ""technical issues"", which turned out to be caused by the baggage compartment doors being stuck. Only after an additional 30 minutes, did they move folks over to an adjacent gate, and different aircraft. Once the people from that flight had all disembarked, including the flight crew (which took about 20 minutes), we all waited another 30 minutes in line while some of the staff were scrambling to switch folks over, and others were standing around doing nothing or talking on their cell phones. Once everyone was on board and settled in, the Captain announced over the intercom that it would be yet another 40 minutes until catering arrived and stocked the aircraft! The seats being cramped and uncomfortable is to be expected. No points there either. Absolutely asinine. For Pete's sake this is a subsidiary of Air Canada, I expected more, and was thoroughly let down. I will avoid them in the future like the plague.",,,,,
"  Absolutely the worst airline out there. Terrible seat, extremely uncomfortable, rude and unfriendly staff. No snack or screen on a 4 hour flight. They charged us 35$ for checking out one bag on the way to Punta Cana and 35$ again on the way back. They lost our luggage with our home key, car key and all our medications. Nobody accepts the responsibility. They are extremely rude and cheap. The worst airline out there. Stay away! I will never travel with Air Canada again and will never recommend it to anyone.",,,,,
" Las Vegas to Toronto. Air Canada is pretty much a disgrace to the Canadian image and the maple leaf. It seriously needs to revamp it's customer experience/service strategy, as well as upgrade a majority of its fleet. Most of the planes, especially those serving its own country and the US are from sometime in the early 90's it seems. Squeaky seats, fraying seatbelts, broken air vents, non-functional lavatories causing huge delays, loss of baggage are just a few examples. Rude staff on the phone and on the planes is another disconcerting issue. Let's pull up our socks, Air Canada, and represent the country the way it deserves to be.",,,,,
  Lisbon to Toronto. Awfully long wait at check-in although we were already checked in and printed our boarding pass. I recommend to go in the assistance required lineup which has double the counters. People who were behind us but did not already check in ended up well ahead of us checking in. I also would like to complain that on the overnight flight to Lisbon from Toronto the light above my seat could not be turned off (asked the flight attendant for help) and I could not sleep at all.,,,,,
"  Toronto to Panama City. A 5 hour flight in an aircraft designed for domestic flights. No room for the legs, no food (not even a cracker), 2 glasses of tap water, a crowded and warm plane and no entertainment system. They lost my sleeping bag and refuse to take the claim at the airport.",,,,,
"  I flew Air Canada Rouge (booked by our Travel Agent, we saw Air Canada and thought 'great' we didn’t realise that they were their budget fleet) for three flights in September 2019 from Manchester to Toronto and Calgary and then Vancouver back to Manchester. I was with my husband and his parents. All three flights were delayed leaving: First Flight: two and a quarter hours delay taking off because of a fuel light fault (this should have been sorted before we boarded and sat there all that time - preventable) Second Flight: an hour late leaving owing to a staff shortage for that flight (this should have been sorted out before we boarded - preventable) Third Flight: 15 minutes late leaving because of a late boarding passenger (not really Rouges fault). On our first flight, the delay in leaving almost caused us to miss our connection in Toronto. We managed to make it to our connecting plane Boarding Passes in hand, only to be told we had been removed (our seats undoubtedly re-sold). After much dithering, the staff managed to re assign us. However, our luggage didn’t make the flight as Rouge had decided to put it on a later flight (ours and lots of other peoples) but didn’t think to tell us, so we waited ages at the carousel the other end unnecessarily. Eventually and after much anxiety on our part it all arrived at our hotel in the middle of the night. My husband and I were in Premium Economy. The seats were extremely hard and uncomfortable. Seatbelts were short with not much room to slacken. The legroom was fine, but you couldn’t stretch out as there was a large mounting bracket beneath the seat in front. The overhead bins were minuscule. The iPads we were given to entertain us on the return flight wouldn’t connect properly, saying there was an error. We couldn’t be bothered to report it as we were so tired. It looked like everyone else’s was the same. The food was just ok and nothing special. Air stewards on all flights were friendly enough, but did seem disinterested. My in-laws were in Economy and experienced all of the above, except smaller seats and no in-flight entertainment. Unfortunately, their seats weren’t clean either, attached is a picture of the gap in my mother-in-laws footwell, it was absolutely filthy and there appeared to be months of old litter and food debris. Unfortunately, as a whole Air Canada Rouge was pretty poor and it’s highly unlikely that we will ever use them again, or recommend them to anyone.",,,,,
" Toronto to Edmonton. This is the worst airline I have ever flown, the staff were so very rude. They have you squashed in there like sardines, you cannot move, you are constantly bumping the seat in front of you, as is the person sitting behind you. The seats, if you could call them that was like sitting on concrete, you literally had to crawl over the armrest to get out of your seat as there is no leg room at all. I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life. The staff were horrible and when coming around with the beverage cart, they kept skipping rows and not bothering to ask people if they wanted anything. No in-flight entertainment at all, not even a place to plug in your headphones to at the very least listen to music. This airline is a joke if you ever see Air Canada rouge come up, stay far away. I tried to opt-out of giving any star ratings at all because they truly deserve nothing, but it would not allow me to submit otherwise.",,,,,
" Manchester to Toronto. Not impressed with Air Canada rouge. Two-hour delay as problems with fuel. Booked seating going fine, returning didn’t book seats. My husband and I couldn’t sit together, although a number of people were by themselves and were sleeping using three seats. My husband asked if we could sit in empty seats which meant we could sit together and they refused. The staff on the plane were generally disinterested for the whole six-hour flight, food on the outgoing flight was not too bad, but return flight so, so.",,,,,
" Flight 1: I arrived early to Detroit - 3 hours early because international flight. They would not take my checked bag because I was too early. They stated that they only take check bags 1 hour prior to boarding time. This meant I was stuck sitting in the pre-security area of the airport for 2 hours. I had no access to food. Flight 2: Delayed leaving Toronto. Obtained updates via text that changed 10 times and had 3 gate changes in the airport. Flight 3: My assigned seat was given to someone else. I was told, oh there are empty seats. I found one myself. When we boarded it was raining - they closed the doors and then we were told we had to wait to take off. Waited for over 30 mins. Flight 4: No issues. Picked up bag only to find it must have sat on the tarmac in the rain at flight 3 time - everything in my bag was soaked when I got it. Flight 2 and 3 were on larger planes that appeared to be newer but no power plugs for phones or iPads. App for movie worked fine. I was not impressed at all. Will avoid flying with Air Canada rouge in the future!",,,,,
"  Toronto to Barcelona. These planes are way too tight for long haul flights. I felt like a sardine! A friend paid extra for her seat and was very uncomfortable. The ""first class"" seats are a joke for all the extra room they have. Our return trip from Rome was longer but seemed shorter in a regular Air Canada plane. The seats were comfortable with more leg room and monitors on the seat backs, no extra cost paid for seats.",,,,,
"  Las Vegas to Toronto. Very rude staff. No snacks offered. Asked for water twice, half hour later no one brought it. When asked for the third time they started giving attitude like it's our fault. The plane was half full yet they lied saying it overfilled and people need to check in their carry on. Plane was delayed. The board information was not updated until the last second. Will never fly Air Canada again.",,,,,
" Calgary to Toronto. First time flying with Air Canada rouge and the last. The aircraft smelled like a children's daycare center, probably not cleaned for some time. The crew seemed totally uninterested and displayed an ""I wish I was not here attitude"". The flight was fine, left early and arrived early but no comparison with an actual Air Canada flight.",,,,,
" Toronto to Kingston. 115 pm departure time, all people on board door close. Then they started loading luggage. Finished loading 155pm. Sat on the plane for longer than 80 min before moving. Why board if luggage not loaded or not scheduled to load?",,,,,
"  Toronto to Bucharest. Contacted Customer Care at Air Canada and have been provided with links to the policies of the company - very much useless. Paid over 2 thousand dollars for my parents for an international flight, paid about 300 dollars round trip for regular check in luggage below 23 kg. My parents got a piece of bread dipped in maple syrup, no free coffee or tea on the flight to Bucharest last night. Will think twice before booking Air Canada. I will not make that mistake again.",,,,,
"  Flew to Lisbon Sept 10 on AC1916, economy. Nice new plane. First drink not served until dinner 2 or 3 hours later. Staff confirmed in flight entertainment did not work on this plane. Should work on iPad or android device as there are no built in screens on Rouge. On flights to Europe they do provide a hot meal. It was very good (within north America you pay for food). The fees to pre-book seats are high, exorbitant for seats with more leg room. No longer a bargain flight. Standard seats are okay, as on air transat. Rouge MUST solve the in-flight entertainment.",,,,,
"  Las Vegas to Toronto. There was nothing premium (or Rouge's version of Business Class) about this aircraft or service. First, the aircraft: a very old 767 where the overhead bins were not configured to match today's carry-on baggage. Thankfully, my carry-on was only partially filled because I had to push that down to squeeze it into the bin above my seat. The seat itself looked premium class in a 2 by 2 by 2 configuration. On take-off and landing everything rattled and shook and I was actually surprised the plane made the flight without falling to pieces. Service: only a bottle of water laid on the seat with no pre-flight drink service like other ""business class"" offerings from other airlines. The wine, if one wants to call it that, was barely drinkable and I chose the pasta meal choice because the curry from the butter chicken was making me nauseous and I was in row 1! The crew did the mandatory service of drinks followed by lunch then a snack before landing. However, in between all of this there was hardly any follow-up with the premium class passengers. They were more concerned with ensuring that the curtain from the cabin to the galley was shut solid with the velcro closures. Getting to Vegas I used a different airline where the service was top notch as it should for business class but the kicker: the other airline cost was about 70% less than what I paid for this dreadful flight!",,,,,
 Venice to Toronto. Horrible experience with this airline. Will never fly with Air Canada rouge again. We were delayed due to mechanical issues for nearly 3 hours causing us to miss our connection. Wouldn’t do anything to help and had the attitude that they got us from point A to B so who cares what time it was supposed to get in. Awful customer service. Entertainment system kept freezing up the whole flight. All in all a terrible experience.,,,,,
"  Los Angeles to Warsaw via Toronto. Really disappointing customer service - when they ran out of hot tea in my aisle, I had to ask for it couple times and still didn’t get it.  I was shocked, this attitude is something that cannot be explained. Little leg room, old aircraft, no entertainment in seats and bad experience. No snacks included on a 5,5h flight to San Francisco, meals served only on Europe to Canada flight. Tickets weren’t cheap and that’s why all those mentioned things were more than frustrating.",,,,,
 Deer Lake to Toronto. Flew to Newfoundland on Friday and flight was delayed over 2 hours due to mechanical problems. Now trying to fly back to Toronto on Monday after a great weekend only to be delayed 4 hours due to mechanical problems. I love Newfoundland (born in Ontario) but stay away from this airline - Rouge is a nightmare.,,,,,
"  We travelled Toronto to Varadero with Air Canada rouge in late August and very pleased: the on-time departure, flight crew service, food served / purchased, very comfortable, not as cold as we have experienced with other airlines. Karim and Cassandra were very helpful flight attendant. We will chose this airline in our future travel. Thank you.",,,,,
"  Fort Lauderdale to Montreal. I requested wheelchair assistance with a service dog but the gentleman did not want to push the wheelchair because I had my service dog with me. His exact words were ""I don’t like dogs"" even though he saw how badly I needed his help. I am very upset that this happened, the man was very rude and arrogant. Thank goodness there was another kind man nearby us who offered his assistance because my family member was carrying the bags.",,,,,
"  Flight 1852, August 22, Las Vegas to Toronto. Very cheap service. No coffee or tea. With the Air Canada stocks doing so well, the company should invest more in customer satisfaction. No space for luggage on plane even though it meets the requirements.",,,,,
  Nice to Montreal with Air Canada rouge. Flew both with this airline for my recent honeymoon in August 2019. Both flights were delayed for “technical issues”. I could not get over the filthiness of the plane. See picture attached. I wish I had also taken a picture of the tray which was covered in crumbs and smears from previous passengers.,,,,,
"  While the premium seats (extra legroom) in rows 13 to 15 were very comfortable, the real irritation was with the Air Canada Rouge Player. I tried to watch two movies on my return flight (to Toronto) on August 16. Both movies cut out at various places in the movie. I waited patiently for the buffering circle to take me back to the movie where it was interrupted but neither movie came on. I had to exit the Air Canada app, re-enter the App, re-enter the Rouge player, and try to fast forward to where each movie was interrupted. I gave up on the first movie, thinking there was something particularly wrong with that movie. Same thing happed with my second move. I had to exit and re-enter the player over 10 times (I stopped counting at 10). In this day and age, an airline like AC Rouge, which forces you to use an wifi player to access entertainment, you would think they could get it right and make the experience seamless, enjoyable and not irritating. This ruined my flight. Never had this problem on Westjet, which uses a similar wifi player on its app.",,,,,
"  Manchester to Toronto. Having read the reviews I was quite concerned and pleasantly surprised by the actual experience! The flight was on time, clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. Yes the seats were slimline, we had to take our own iPad and the food was basic, but for someone who mainly flies budget airlines within Europe it really wasn’t too bad at all, We were also pleasantly surprised to find a charging point to keep our iPad which we’d stocked up with Netflix to keep us going, a 23kg luggage allowance, free transit of kids car seats and pillows and blankets. I think that as long as you don’t expect the actual full Air Canada offer and are aware of the differences with Rouge, then for us at least it was a cheap and effective way to get to our destination.",,,,,
"  Flying with Air Canada Rouge from Athens to Toronto was my most difficult experience so far. In addition to pay extra for alcoholic drinks, ear phones, seats designated for mothers and babies, I had to pay for entertainment. The internet is very expensive and charged by hour.  The flight was 11 hours. Traveling with an 18 months old baby, I was forced to purchase the WiFi service, $42.50 for the whole flight. There was no written instruction in the seat pocket so the pilot gave us instructions in the beginning. With a baby sleeping on my lap, I had to call for help. The flight attendant gave a brief instructions and left. My credit card was charged but the page crashed. I could not use the service. Again I had to asked for help, the flight attendant came and advised that she cannot troubleshoot and we have to chat with ground.  My husband had to spend half an hour just to get the refund for that transaction. I was given a notice to hold my baby when the seat belt sign was on for so long during the flight and there was no turbulence.  We were offered hot drinks two times during the flight and due to the turbulence we could not have them, I understand it's because of safety but they should come back after the seat belt sign is off to serve those who wish to have hot drinks. This is a service that it has been paid for. At the time of check-in we asked for a seat with bassinet. Although that there was a free one but we had to pay extra plus since the baby was older than 1 year, he could not use the bassinet due to the safety issue.  So what's the use of paying extra if I cannot use the bassinet in this flight.  The food was awful. There was absolutely no accommodation for the young children and babies, Unfriendly staff. I chose this flight because I had good experience with Air Canada. I did not know that Rouge is different. ",,,,,
"  Air Canada domestic was fine, it was another average/decent flight. No bells and whistles some little monitor tv’s in the seat although mine didn’t work...nothing fancy but fine none the less. Air Canada rouge international flight was the worst flight I’ve ever been on. Small, uncomfortable, average everything. No tv monitors or entertainment. The arm rest... where your elbow will naturally place itself .. and BAM the lights are on blaring at everyone. The button placement is by far the most ill thought out tech I’ve ever seen. Completely insane that a switch that can cause such a disturbance is the easiest thing to tap with your arm. Every 5 seconds lights were blasting on and off and the chatter of angry people who accidentally rested there elbow on a arm rest and regretted it! Then they told us we can hook to the wifi but to do it quick because it only allows 110 people to connect. So finally 5 hours into the flight I connect. 7 minutes into my movie it freezes and never comes back. I reload, it plays, it stops again I’ve never in all my years of traveling, all my international flights and all my adventures been on such a silly plane. I won’t book again.",,,,,
  Toronto to Venice. Delayed 1 hour 40 minutes on departure due to technical difficulty. No water offered in that time. Personnel used last 3 rows of seats for themselves and didn't allow people to use them. Food was barely edible for me. Not enough room for knees for average man. ,,,,,
"  Toronto to Manchester. Unfortunately delayed and hour but the counter staff were well informed and could update us - this due to late inbound aircraft. Rouge uses older aircraft so we did not expect all the ""bells and whistles"" but we could charge and use our own devices on board. Seating was fine with plenty of leg room in row 15. On board crew were good. Food was poor (we had a chicken dish) but I am not sure we expected any better, although on our daytime flight to Canada a month earlier the food was pretty much OK; but then in economy we always fly expecting poor food on whichever airline, so if it is good we have a surprise! Overall the flight was perfectly adequate. Improvements? Maybe the food. Staff uniforms need a new fashion designer; some of the female outfits were a poor fit and looked uncomfortable. On booking flights, like most budget airlines, the hidden costs need to be shown more clearly.",,,,,
"  My family and I flew with Air Canada Rouge from Edinburgh to Toronto then on to Havana and then back to Toronto and back to Manchester recently. I would say that, having done a lot of travelling, I was very disappointed with the service levels, the staff and the quality of experience we had. There is no inflight entertainment, which, when you are travelling on planes for 10 hours is pretty poor in this day and age. They say you can download an app to your phone and get entertainment through this. We all did this but it didn't work and you couldn't watch anything without it constantly buffering! The staff were unfriendly and unhelpful, the flight back to Manchester was one of the coldest flights I have ever experienced - maybe the pilot left the window open overnight so extremely difficult to sleep when your teeth are chattering! The price wasn't that cheap as to justify these corners being cut. Also three out of four flights delayed and two overbooked and looking for volunteers to step off flight! If you have another option I wouldn't use Air Canada - never flown with them before and thought Air Canada would be good but left extremely disappointed! Final point, the app also doesn't work for you to confirm seats and do online check-in - it takes you to a ""report an error page"" which then doesn't work! Sums it up for me.",,,,,
"  Cancun to Montreal. I had the most amazing flight with Air Canada Rouge yesterday, July 31st. It was smooth and very quick to arrive. One flight attendant in particular made my trip even more special. Giulia saw that I was crying (they were tears of gratitude) and while I was in the bathroom, left me a chocolate bar at my seat with a note saying “No matter what it is, life is good. Keep on smiling”. I have never received so much sympathy from a professional in this industry before. Definitely a touching detail I will never forget that brightened up my already great experience! Thank you Air Canada and Giulia!",,,,,
"  Flew in from Venice to Toronto on flight AC1907 on July 18th. Although we were in Economy, the staff/crew treated us exceptionally well. Courteous, pleasant and prompt service. Circulated and saw to our needs. Pleasant disposition and truly made us feel valued. Made the 9 hour flight a very positive experience. Thank you, crew of flight AC1907.",,,,,
"  Flight from Montreal to Marseille in June 2019 delayed 2 hrs due to mechanical difficulties. We finally take off & 3 hrs into flight we turn around & return to Montreal because of mechanical difficulties. Sleep in airport for 4 hours. Board again, and delayed for another 2 hrs. Arrive in France 13 hrs late. We were told to keep our hotel receipts so we could be reimbursed. Not only do they refuse to reimburse us, but they won’t even provide name & contact number of a person to speak to - all communications must be done electronically. We went with AC because it was more affordable & between paying for seats & hotel rooms it ended up being significantly more $$. ",,,,,
  Marseille to Washington via Montreal / Toronto. Flight from Montreal was delayed due to mechanical difficulties. We were forced to wait onboard for hours while they fixed the problem. We missed our connecting flight in Toronto & they had only 3 agents to help hundreds of guests that had missed their connection. We had to spend the night in Toronto & get new flight home the next morning. Air Canada refuses to reimburse for hotel room. Furthermore - there’s no phone number to call to speak to an agent - all communication must be done electronically.  Instead they offered me a voucher for a future flight - I will never fly Air Canada again!!,,,,,
"  No entertainment. The only entertainment was through a in flight online service which is accessed through your own device. The service was not working for the whole flight. With a one year old child makes a 8 hour flight difficult. Lack of in flight service. To finish it off, they damaged our bag.  I tried to speak to them about it but they gave me a card to contact them on. Now back in the UKand don’t want to call at fear of further cost and their online complaint proceeded not working. So, I’m stuck, with no help.",,,,,
"  Have flown this route a few times in ""Premium Rouge"" Firstly, it has always been late. On my most recent flight Manchester to Toronto no amenity kit in Premium Rouge, iPads lent out but no headphones, not a  word from the pilots. Food basic. On the return YYZ/MAN Premium breakfast is a slice of banana bread with a drink. Same aircraft both ways and the iPads were grubby, the seat trays dirty. I find the premium rouge seats uncomfortable when compared with Air Canada premium economy. Also, if you use the Rouge iPads, entertainment is only films, no music, games or moving map. Pretty poor experience. Having used the service a few times, have decided I will no longer use Rouge for any further flights.",,,,,
"  Zagreb to Toronto. My first and last flight on Air Canada rouge. The plane was old, dirty and in horrible shape. When I took my seat, I noticed that a piece of floor loose so I told that to the flight attendant. She laughed and took it away. While they were serving lunch I asked the attendant to ask the person in front to put their seat back upright so that I could eat. She answered ""I can't do that, everyone is entitled to their comfort."" I couldn't believe what she told me and was furious. I found the food  terrible. The good side was that they offered drinks and water very, very often, which was really nice.",,,,,
"  Vergognoso! Per risolvere qualunque cosa ti obbligano a chiamare il call center a pagamento. ( e avrete bisogno di loro sempre in quanto nulla può essere fatto in linea e hanno sempre problemi). Rilasciano buoni che non possono essere utilizzati online (ovviamente devi chiamare il call center), mandano link di pagamento che scadono in 2 ore e danno problemi sulla transazione ( ovviamente devi chiamare il call center). Assolutamente sconsigliati! - Shameful! To resolve anything they force you to call the paid call center. (and you will always need them as nothing can be done online and they always have problems). They issue vouchers that cannot be used online (obviously you have to call the call center), they send payment links that expire in 2 hours and give problems on the transaction (of course you have to call the call center). Absolutely not recommended!",,,,,
" I booked my flight with Air Caraibes to flight to Reunion through Paris in November 2019 using the travel agency Travel2Be. My flight was cancelled by the airline in late March. I receive a message saying that I can reschedule my flight for later. Then the situation with covid-19 got really bad and the EU issued a travel ban for all US citizens. I contacted Travel2Be to explain the situation to them and it took them a long time to reply saying that I have one year from the date of original purchase to use my tickets or I would lose them. I then tried to fill out a refund form on Air Caraibes. The site did not work and there was no email or number to contact them. I reply to the cancellation email, once again explaining the situation and asking them if they could extend the ticket to 2021. Their answer was use it by November 2020 or lose them. The airline cancelled the flight and this was out of their control but I also have not control over the travel ban. How are they expecting me to flight if I am banned from entering the EU and there are no end date for the ban? I have tried several emails and have received the same answer: use them by November or your lost. Best wishes. Are you kidding me? They basically took my money, didn’t provide any service and they won’t give it back. Both Travel2BE and Air Caraibes are horrible and dishonest companies. I will never ever use them or any companies associated with them. These companies are taking people’s money and then asking the government to bail them out. Who is going to bail the customer’s out? The customers who lost their money and probably have been affected greatly by the pandemic. ",,,,,
"  Our flight was canceled due to the Covid-19 issues, but from Air Caraïbes we never received mails concerning our canceled flight. Once we figured out ourselves, we were offered (by text on the website) to change date.  So in fact only the date that was affected was changeable, meaning our holiday was shortened by several weeks! Almost never did a new search for a reservation work. It was not available or simply not possible. No reason was given. You receive error messages in code (no text, but numbers with no explanation whatsoever) for whatever you try to do. They offer no help at all. The chat on the website is a robot that is not even capable of understanding what your question is and responded with answers we never asked for. Asking for help by phone is impossible and not even free. I already had to rebook my flight 4 times and every time the same mess again. Eventually since July they offer a refund in cash (to your credit card). Although I was legit for a full refund by reading the needed conditions on their site, once I submitted for the refund, I got a message saying that in my 'specific' situation I need to call Air Carraïbes for further assistance and predictable as I had read in many other reviews. No one is responding my call. In no way is it possible to get decent help or assistance and figuring out if everything is still in the running is all up to you to follow up your booking. For 2 of the rebookings I was going to receive a small refund of €21. Even today no refund was given. But in the cases where I had to pay a supplement, before realizing it, it was already taken from my credit card. As soon as you receive your new tickets with new dates, you receive a message in your account that dates are canceled or will not be available (again). It's terrible how they treat their customers. Never flown with them and never intend to in the future. To be clear, we have a ticket and booked a flight, but we were so far not able to fly, change dates or receive a refund or a better date to fly in the future. So our choice never to fly them in the future is because of the lack of a respectful customer service. ",,,,,
"  I had to fly with Air Caraïbes to Paris to connect back to Canada, as due to COVID there are no Canadian directs. I initially chose Air Caraïbes because the flight was ridiculously cheap, only €150 for a transatlantic flight! The airport and gate were typical for a mid-sized Caribbean airport - it had what I needed, but nothing more. When I first saw the plane, I realized how brand new it looked - it was an A350-1000. Getting on board, the modern feel of the cabin was obvious. I had a seat in the very back row, but still the seat was comfortable and it had above-average legroom. It came with your usual screen equipped with a good number of entertainment options. What really caught my eye with the screens, though, was the exterior cameras. I had a middle row, so it was amazing to still be able to watch the takeoff from a tailfin-mounted camera, and now I wish every plane had that! The food was excellent, there was only one option as far as I could tell but I did really enjoy the food, yet it was simple enough that most people would like at least some portion of it. Communicating with staff went fine with the basic amount of French I know as a Canadian, and anyone who complains about them not speaking English is obviously a little self-centred and doesn't realize that this is a local Caribbean airline serving only French locations, they shouldn't have to learn English to help out the 1 American traveller on a flight. Even with all of that, all of the gate announcements and in-flight announcements were also said in English, so I don't really get how this could be much of a problem. I will say that it was unfortunate that their main website had an English page but the booking screen was only in French, but again, I don't really hold it against them and got it booked with a little help from Google Translate. If you can't handle that, just book it from Expedia or something. All in all, this Air Caraïbes flight might just have been the best Economy experience that I've ever had, and I would definitely fly with them again, especially if the price stays that amazing!",,,,,
"  Pointe A Pitre to Paris. We bought our Business Class tickets, but actually we got only Premium Economy seats. I think the reasonable way to deal with it is to return the price difference to us.",,,,,
" The worst airline ever! They don't speak English and rarely do they ever reply to you (and even if they do, that will be in French of course). Online check-in is fake - it doesn't work before the flight and they refuse to help you with that over the phone or email. Their employees at the airport are very unfriendly and completely unhelpful when met in person - you see that you are a burden for them when you need help at the airport. Besides, the airline lost my baggage and it can't be traced any more at all. Conclusion: if possible, try to avoid this terrible airline, it's the worst French airline for sure, low-costs show you more respect and understanding than this horrible airline. Don't fly them if you want a pleasant flight and good pre-/post-flight experience.",,,,,
"  Paris to San Francisco. Extremely sketchy airline. They cancelled our flight back from Paris due to ""operational difficulties"" and said they could only book us on a flight 2 days later. They would not refund us the money for the flight even though they could not offer anything even close to what we booked. Their customer service just sent us in circles: call this number, call back tomorrow, submit a ticket here, email this address, call this other number. The company hides behind their phone reps, having them continuously say ""The company has issued a statement saying they will not refund anyone's money for the flight"". If you cancel a flight and can only replace it with a flight two days later you better give customers the opportunity to take a refund.",,,,,
  Pointe-à-Pitre to Paris Orly. Good service on this route in Classe Madras (business class). Flight took off and arrived on time. A good dinner was served shortly after take-off and a breakfast shortly before landing. The cabin crew were friendly and professional. However I have to say that I prefer the layout in the business class on their A330. The layout on this newer aircraft certainly has more functions but it looked quite cumbersome and crowded to me. Incredibly the selection of French songs was also very limited. Lounge in Pointe-à-Pitre was also quite small and very limited food ( good if you are on a diet as they were very slow to replenish the food supply ). Overall I think Air Caraïbes is good for this route but a few improvements can be made.,,,,,
"  Saint Martin to Paris Orly via Pointe à Pitre. Not an experience I'd like to repeat. First, my French isn't great so I had to find out at Pointe a Pitre that I needed to check in but I didn't need to pick up my hold baggage. So that meant I had 2 hours of queuing to check in, go through customs and security leaving it very fine to get my flight. Luckily, the flight was delayed by 1 hour 30 so there was no rush. The boarding process was confusing and disorganised with continual announcements apologising for delays, calling babies, children, rows and a reminder that seats EFGH boarded through gate A, seats ABCD boarded through gate B. The FAS were ok. Apart from when they left our food on our trays for 40 minutes, I took our trays up in the end and they said they forgot. They also left a full cup of coffee in the holder for landing despite us trying to ask them to take it away. Food was not great especially the tub of apple puré/ baby food and a bread roll for breakfast. The in flight entertainment was limited for English speakers and we arrived late so I missed my connecting flight. They also left baggage from everyone who connected from Saint Martin in Point a Pitre. Which was weird considering we were delayed. I called customer service to try and upgrade my flight in the hope an upgrade would make the return journey less unpleasant. My french isn't great which I explained but the customer service girl lost patience and cut me off. I will never fly Air Caraïbes again.",,,,,
  On the 24th September 2017 I had a Premium Economy flight booked from Paris Orly to Pointe a Pitre which we booked 9 months beforehand. However a couple weeks before we received a schedule change which meant that we had a return from Pointe a Pitre 1 day earlier and then because we had a flight back to the UK on our original return date we had to spend alot of money of a hotel in Paris Orly as we we returning one day early. Air Caraibes refused to provide us with a hotel or a refund and instead mentioned that we should make a claim after our travel. I made a claim to Air Caraibes at the beginning of October 2017 however they have not replied. I have sent another email for compensation so fingers cross I will get a response. Terrible,,,,,
"  Paris to Pointe a Pitre. I booked a flight Premium Class flight through Opodo and I am due to flight out with Air Caraibes near the end of September 2017. I recently contacted my travel agent who mentioned that Air Caraibes had cancelled my return flight from Pointe a Pitre to Paris Orly and rebooked me for another flight 1 day later. I explained to Opodo that I booked this ticket 9 months ago and I also booked a connecting flight from Paris Orly to London on the same day that my flight has been now changed to which means that I will miss my Connection. Opodo mentioned that they could not do anything and I would have to speak with Air Caraibes. I transferred to Air Caraibes and the staff did not even give me a chance to speak, she was very rude and told me to go speak to Opodo and did not want to listen, I was speaking to her for about 1 minute. This service was very disgusting as I had booked 2 premium class tickets and I was expecting some sort of understand. I called back Opodo and explained what had happened and they didnt really care, I have asked Opodo to give me a full refund as my return flight has been changed for a different day and they are unable to give me an alternative flight for the day I booked to leave. It was even more upsetting as I check Skyscanner and found many other carriers offering flights however Opodo mentioned that the airline does not have alliance with these carriers. That said they still refused to refund my money. I asked Opodo to find me an alternative flight to leave 1 day earlier so I can make my connecting flight however I have not yet heard back from them and it has been 4 days now.",,,,,
  Air Caraibes direct flight from Paris Orly to Pointe-à-Pitre. Lounge access in Orly but not a great selection of food. The lounge was calm and not too crowded. Good service on board with a 2-2-2 configuration. As I was travelling on my own I opted for one of the aisle seats in the middle. That way I had direct access to the aisle and nobody will need to step over me to get to the aisle. The food served was good and the cabin spacious. The return flight was delayed but it didn't worry me too much as I had no connecting flight to catch. However the lounge in Pointe-à-Pitre was quite basic with not much to eat. Nevertheless the ambiance was calm and relaxing. Service onboard was again very good and the food delicious.,,,,,
  St Martin to Paris Orly via Pointe-à-Pitre with Air Caraibes. Seats are very narrow and legroom very limited. On the outbound flight to Paris my individual screen along with numerous others in the Economy cabin were not functioning and despite advising the crew nothing was done. Both out and inbound flights to and from Paris were delayed and very disorganized boarding process didn't help. Poor seat cleanliness and rude customer service.,,,,,
"  Paris Orly to Punta Cana (Dominican Republic) with Air Caraibes, and a very bad experience. 36 hours of delay. Very old and dirty plane, and no inflight entertainment screen. The cabin crew were extremely unpleasant, and Air Caraibes Customer service never answer to me. You have a number of your seat but when you arrive in the cabin crew just say ""you can sit where you want""! Crazy, and it was unconfortable travel",,,,,
Flew from Paris to Cayenne on October 2013 in business class. Overall good experience nice lounge in Paris Orly South fast track to go quickly from customs and police. Good seating on board with a 2x2x2 configuration. Not a full flat but a 160 degrees recline seat but very comfortable. Very good food and excellent champagne. But the most interesting is the price: 1600 euros Air France is much more expensive comparing with Air Caraibes.,,,,,
Flew July from Cayenne French Guiana to Paris in Premium Economy during an overnight 8 hours flight. Food ok seat premium economy standard seat. Very friendly service my wife's IFE was not working crew were nice and asked another passenger if he would move as he was not using the IFE.,,,,,
Travelled from Orly via Pointe-à-Pitre to St Barth. Newish 330 across the Atlantic with comfortable and fresh Business section - nearly flat with large screens. Friendly service with OK meal service. Helpful transfer process in Pointe-à-Pitre and then small plane across to St Barth. Competitive pricing translated into great value.,,,,,
I flew on TX from ORY to FDF have to admit I was quite impressed. The PA in 3 languages including Creole meal was great with Caribbean touch and 2 options in Eco PTV on board (larger than AF COI very high density) cheaper than other competitors. Colourful friendly cabin crew and on time performance was great. Very professional.,,,,,
I was really surprised with this flight between Cayenne (French Guiana) and Paris in business class. There is a new business class on the A330-300 angle lie seat with a recline of 160° 18 seats with a configuration 2x2x2 outbound 8.5 hrs flight to Paris. Very good staff during this night flight I called to get some water and the attendant was there within 2 minutes. You can really sleep well in this new seat inbound 9 hours flight very good food wine champagne with attentive service - really worth the money. Only 1300 euros for a return ticket.,,,,,
ORY-PTP return in Business Class. On the outward flight from Paris we were first told we would have to fly via Fort de France eventually they got us a seat on the initial flight. It was a leased aircraft of Hi Fly. The cabin was filthy plastic spoons on the floor the seat with bread crumbs dust and grease everywhere. The seat was at most an Economy + seat. The entertainment was of no use an economy tray with inedible food. No curtains to separate cabins and galley. Not to speak of the condition of the toilet. I feel it is not correct to not provide excuse and compensation to passengers if the delivered product differs so much from the purchased one.,,,,,
We just had the most miserable experience with Air Caraibes and will never fly them again. On the trip from St. Maarten to Gaudeloupe via St. Barths they flew is to St. Barths then upon arrival we were told we had to return to St. Martin (Grande Case) and fly to Guadeloupe. No instructions as to how to make the transfer. On our flight from Guadeloupe to St. Barths we were flown first to St. Maarten again with no indication that we were not going directly to St. Barths until we boarded the plane. Then waited 3 hours in St. Maarten with no advice from the gate agents who would not even answer questions before being rushed onto a WinAir flight to St. Barths with 10 minutes notice.,,,,,
Air Caraibes is a very good and competitive airline. Better than Corsair which is frequently delayed. Air Caraibes A330 offers space and the quality of service is high.,,,,,
St Martin to St Barts 22nd May. Total confusion and chaos at boarding. Although booked on Air Caraibes we travelled on St Barth Commuter no idea why!. Luckily luggage did arrive with us. St Barts to St Martin 29th May. It took half an hour for Air Caraibes to check in 5 passengers. We stood and waited in a boiling hot check in queue which just grew longer and longer. Some passengers were told to go away and come back later as they refused to check them in early for their flights. The check-in staff are rude with a couldn't care less attitude. There was only one man on the desk who clearly didn't know and didn't care what he was doing there were three other staff in the office behind the check-in desk doing nothing but eating and drinking. This was low season I hate to think what it is like in high season!,,,,,
I would not recommend travel on Air Caraibes. They cancelled our return flight from St. Barths to St. Maarten in February with no prior notice leaving us standing at the gate. The airline offered no alternative transport and refused to refund the unused portion of our tickets on the spot. The counter staff told us we had to apply for a refund through our travel agent. It has been 45 days since we submitted the refund request via our travel agent and Air Caraibes has still not refunded the fares. While the ground personnel in St. Maarten were professional and polite the agents in St. Barths provided no assistance when our luggage did not arrive with us on our inbound flight (a frequent island occurence) did not answer the phone when called to inquire about the luggage the next morning and kept patrons waiting at the counter for 5 to 10 minutes while chatting amongst themselves in their office a few feet away. They were surly and seemingly annoyed by the presence of customers -- an odd attitude on an island dependent on tourism.,,,,,
"  A long flight (10h) Cabin luggage allowance is very low, (5kg). The boarding process went well in Milan. The aircraft itself is average. No signs of modernity, cabin looking quite dirty, small pitch in Economy seats. Although it is said to exist, wifi was never available. Very little variety of movies or series to watch. The catering is of basic quality, and the crew is not particularly nice. Flight was in time.",,,,,
"  Bought tickets from this company. I received a letter to my mail that my flights were rescheduled for another date. Transfers on these tickets are simply not possible. I've been trying to contact the airline for four days now. I called the phone but the call does not go through, I write to the mail but no one answers. It turns out that I just lose my money. This is the worst company I have ever dealt with. If you want to lose money buy a ticket from this company.",,,,,
"  Beijing to Shanghai in October 2020. When getting on the plane, the steward is efficient and fast in guiding passengers. After closing the cabin door, through a very short taxi into the runway ready to take off, without any delay, even in the National Day holiday. But the food is really average, economy class only porridge and pickles, and can't choose anymore. It provides free WiFi, but it can only watch some documentaries and movies, and can't contact the ground. Although the seats of Air China 77W are not very comfortable, the space between the seats is very large and comfortable. PTV is slow to respond, but it contains a lot of films. The landing was very smooth. When we got off the plane, every steward warmly expressed thanks and said goodbye. The price of the ticket is very cheap, only 500 yuan.",,,,,
"  Worst airline and horrible refund policy. I was to fly from Beijing Capital to Dubai, but they cancelled the flight. I applied for a refund and it’s been 4 months and I still have not received my refund.",,,,,
"  I requested a refund to my flight because of COVID-19 which was supposed to be a full refund. However what I learned after calling is in order to get refunded for the flight I can not file for a refund online, it had to be a phone call in order to get a refund. Is this confusing? That's because it is, I did an online 'request to refund' and received no refund. So Air China canceled my flight and took my money! How does that make sense at all? I tried calling them several times and their answer was always different, they canceled the flight and I am out of my money for a flight they never flew all because some side loop hole to screw me over. Seems this is common place for this company and I am personally avoid them for all my future flights, while they are cheap you get what you pay for obviously and the last thing I need when I am trying to take a vacation is dealing with this nightmare of a company.",,,,,
  I flew to Thailand but with the Corona virus they cancelled the flight from Bangkok to London and wouldn't help to bring people back or give a refund so that we can take alternative flights. They were the worst unhelpful airline. Once they get your money they don't care about the customers.,,,,,
"  Vancouver to Guangzhou via Beijing. On my Boeing 744 trip, the plane brought back memories. Normally, I like a updated and brightly lit cabin, but the Boeing 744 really brought something special. Their food is questionable and their inflight was entertainment system can have more selections. They also have good value of money as my round trip costed just over $500CAD. Overall, they have great crew and value but can improve on the food and IFE.",,,,,
"  Guangzhou to Vancouver via Beijing booked for mid-April. The worst airline I have ever seen. Air China doesnt care their customers and just want to get money from their customers. Refund policy is ridiculous and try to cheat customers. When you call customer service, the only thing they said is there is nothing I can do. Will 100% not to choose this airline ever again",,,,,
"  Tianjin to Johannesburg via Shenzhen. Had an unpleasant experience flying with Air China. No service to speak of, the ground staff are content just speaking at you and not listening to what you have to say or are asking. I had to wait for a long time to check in, because my bag was overweight even though I said immediately that I would pay the fee. I ordered the vegan option: I was given a bun smothered in mayonnaise three cucumber slices, some lettuce and an orange wedge. This I did not eat of course. I informed the cabin crew who were polite but unfortunately were unable to help. Could you please enlist the services of a nutritionist and have them review and train your food and beverage department on what constitutes a complete and healthful vegan meal. Do not mislead customers by saying you cater to all dietary requirements when you do not.",,,,,
"  My infant daughter and I flew from Cape Town to Xi'an via Johannesburg and Shenzhen. Firstly I was told our baggage would go all the way to Xi'an (which it did not), but that is the fault of the rude check-in counter rep in Cape Town. My daughter and I arrived in Johannesburg and had to check in our luggage onto our connecting Air China flight to Shenzhen. In Shenzhen I was told to check my luggage in again for the last leg of our journey to Xi'an. However my one suit case and my daughters stroller never arrived, and I later learned that it never left Johannesburg airport. I arrived home having none of my daughters clothes, all her clothes at home were too small for her and to add insult to injury we are now in a 14 day quarantine. We arrived on Tuesday afternoon and were told that on Saturday it would arrive. It is now Saturday evening and still no word on its expected arrival. Utterly shocking service. On a more positive note, cabin crew were friendly and helpful.",,,,,
  Los Angeles to Kansa via Beijing booked for March 2020. I've had great experiences flying Air China. Attendants are friendly and  food is decent. However their response to the COVID-19 outbreak is criminal. They lied repeatedly about issuing a refund. I had to file a credit card dispute to get my money back.,,,,,
  Sydney to Stockholm via Beijing. Really old and rugged airplanes and very little leg room. But the worst part is that the cabin crew makes constant  in-flight announcement. Each time there is a little bump of turbulence there is an announcement in Chinese and English.  It is impossible to make use of IFE system and I recommend a good pair of noise cancelling headphones. Cabin crew speaks poor English but are nice and let me change seats to the emergency seats without having to pay extra. (I am 192 cm tall so very worth while.) Lounge staff in Beijing were OK but one woman went out of her way to change our seats in the lounge making sure that we got better seats and even bumped us up to emergency row also on the second leg of our trip. Very appreciated. I have never had any issues flying with Air China but I know that Chinese ground services customer service can be very inadequate and unhelpful so happy I have not had to deal with that. Overall planes are quite old and dirty and food is poor but value for money is great and it got us to our destination back and forth without any mishaps.,,,,,
"  London to Kathmandu via Chengdu. I enjoyed my flight. The staff were friendly and helpful, the food was good.  I think the reason most people give bad reviews is because staff doesn't understand English and sometimes is difficult to communicate with them. ",,,,,
" New York to Beijing. Air China cannot be trusted as a 1st World Airline. I purchased a refundable airline ticket and had issues with my connection to the Air China flight. My entire family was going to the Far East for my daughter's graduation. Our connecting aircraft was cancelled due to a maintenance issue and we missed our flights. When I tried to re-book the next day, I could not reach anyone in their US office. They were closed. Seriously! I had to call their China number to try and get service. I was told that I had to re-purchase the tickets. My ticket was refundable and so I simply cancelled it given I could not re-schedule my family's flights. I am still waiting on that refund. I have sent approximately 15 e-mails to Air China. I did receive one response that advised me that I had to go to their website and formally cancel my flight which I did on the phone with their service agents. I tried that several times but their site didn't work. My advice to anyone traveling to China, do not use Air China. They are not a professional airline and their service is the absolute worst that I have experienced in 30 years of travel. Fly any other airline but do not subject yourself to this company.",,,,,
"  Montreal to Beijing. Worst airline company, this is the only Chinese airline which refused to provide full refund for tickets cancelled before Jan 28. The government set up policies about refunding but this firm is just playing word games.",,,,,
  Montreal to Manila via Beiijing. After the first flight from Montreal to Beijing they let us know just before boarding with 5 hours delayed that i can t get inboard because the govt of Philippines ban all the non Filipino transit in china airport. Staff of the airport didnt know what to do with all the banned travellers and they just sent from one counter to another one. We cant go out of the airport as we don t have visa and we dont have flight ticket to go out of the country. After 5 hours we finally talked with a manager who offer to us a ticket for Thailand to be out of the country ... they provided us a hotel for few hours and we left for Bangkok after they make us sigh a waiver. This was a very bad experience and obviously the peoples on the airport didn t know what to do. I paid business class to go Philippines and finally i reach Thailand without possibility to come back on track To my trip. The people on Air China spoke very low english and don't know how to manage this kind of situation.,,,,,
"  Frankfurt to Bangkok via Beijing, returning from Singapore to Frankfurt via Beijingh. The positive was flat bed seat, the lounge in Beijing is ok, tried Chinese wine for first time. The negatives incude constant announcements interrupting sleep/entertainment. The sleeping and entertainment gear (duvet, pillow, sleepers and headphones) was constantly checked and taken off one hour before landing because ""people steal them"". Some staff were nice others not. I am a vegetarian, and while everyone was getting canape, starter, main, salad, bread, cheese selection and dessert. I was given one dish on most of the trays, no bread no butter. I was hungry in business class on Air China, first time I ever experience that in biz class. There was a lovely vegetarian menu in Business Class but I was not allowed to have it because I asked for vegetarian option during the booking - very puzzling. The entertainment system is 20 years old, the information is inaccurate. Not impressed. From and to Zurich they cannot emit boarding passes, so it was quite stressful to wait at the gate for someone to give us boarding passes specially the inbound. Information is limited and badly translated from Mandarin. Not impressed.",,,,,
  Bangkok to London via Bejing. The website doesn't work properly so you are not allowed to checkin online. Rude staff that doesn't speak English. Plane really uncomfortable and unclean. Don't change flight in China because you will find yourself lost with staff unable to speak English and very rude. Also they laugh on your face when you try to ask questions in English. I will never recommend this airline.,,,,,
"  London to Manila via Beijing. I went to Manila via Air China and had a connecting flight to Beijing. Upon arrival in Manila, my luggage is not there. I had to fill up a form indicating that my luggage is missing, etc. The following day I received a reference and after that no one even bother to call me or update me about my missing baggage after that. It’s been 6 days already and still I dont receive anything from them. Even their customer service is not helping saying that they dont have contacts to Beijing or Heathrow and all they can do is wait. If only I can go and find it myself in Heathrow, Beijing or Manila airport, I will find it myself.",,,,,
" Recently flew Air China in first-class from Beijing to London. The aircraft is quite new and the seats in first class felt comfortable sitting on. Although the seats are not suite like seats, still once you put up the partition wall up between you and the person next to you, there is privacy. The food was very average but the crew was pleasant. There were 3 pax onboard and 3 crew members were serving. There is nothing exciting to write home about Air China’s first class, but I felt comfortable and relaxed throughout the flight and slept over 5 hours undisrupted.",,,,,
"  Bangkok to Washington via Beijing. Two members of my family arrived in IAD without their checked luggage. The CA rep at IAD provided them with a baggage irregularity report which did not have a complete reference number, which meant that each time trying to follow-up with Air China it was a major hassle having to find the case in their system by using bag tag numbers, etc. Sloppy work on the part of the agent at IAD. We were told that the bags would arrive three days later, despite the fact that there were daily flights with both CA and UA on the PEK-IAD route. The bag finally arrived. I put in a claim for compensation for the purchase of essential clothing and toiletries. I submitted all required documentation and a claim for US$530. I was told to email this information to an Air China agent at LAX. After a week, I had received no response. I called Air China and was told that the agent who told me to email her was on holidays. More ineptness. I was told to email the claim to baggage services at IAD. I did so and received a reply stating that each passenger was entitled to the grand sum of US$43! What does CA think can be purchased in terms of essential clothing and toiletries in the middle of winter in Washington DC for US$43? Shameful on the part of Air China. I wrote the and shared my indignation, particularly as my family members are Star Alliance Gold. They just lost me and my family as customers.",,,,,
"  Booked a trip from Singapore to Tokyo via Beijing for my family this December holiday as it is really very affordable, and it turned out great! We got our luggage safe and intact. The flight entertainment was alright - not a lot of new movies but have some that we have not watched so that got us through our flights. The service was alright too. Maybe that is because we can speak and understand mandarin. Food was not good but bearable. Overall, we had a good, value for money experience.",,,,,
"  Sydney to Beijing. This has to be the worst airline in the world! After herding us (pensioners) into a huddle at Sydney airport they left us like that for 6 hours and then tell us the plane is technical and go get a hotel and come back tomorrow (after 2 weeks they gave us AUD200 each). when we did they had cancelled us out of all our flights to Portugal and we had to get Flight Center to re-book us, they hadn't even booked us on the new flight. The staff couldn't give a monkeys about its pax and treated us like animals and were so arrogant. The queue even had a fight as people were so tense and the police were called. ",,,,,
"  Sydney to Moscow via Beijing. The worst airline of all time! Website and App are horrible, making online check in not possible. For example, on app, you cannot check in if you do not have a Chinese phone number. When you enter a code of a different country, it defaults back to Chinese. For long flights it is so crucial to be able to select a seat before all the good ones are taken. After 2 hours of trying and multiple customer care calls which brought zero result, I have last row middle seats on both of my flights (24+ hours journey time). Unbelievable! Customer care is useless as well: they cannot do anything about not working online check in and are not even able to tell at what time airport check in closes. This is the very least they should be able to advise. On the flight there is very little leg room (even for me with 165 cm highly), the wine they serve is of very poor quality, the meals are rather small. I will never fly with them again!",,,,,
"  Beijing to Rome. I like Air China, but at this trip I don’t like, because the plane is very old.  Air China’s A330 this plane is very old. A lot of Air China’s aircraft there aren’t any WiFi other Chinese airlines have more airplanes have a WIFI, I don’t know why Air China hasn’t got a WIFI on his aircraft and it was a one of the most important airlines in China. ",,,,,
"  London to Beijing. Rubbish airline, they changed flights 5-6 times and the final change the day before departure. Unable to make change, so they cancel whole booking. They shift the responsibility to the booking agent despite the booking being with them and them making the change.",,,,,
 Montreal to Bangkok via Beijing. Late (1 hour). Food not good. Staff not helpful and not friendly. Not able to get boarding pass electronically so had to wait 90 minutes in line at Bangkok. Had to wait in line another 90 mins to pass through various levels of security in Beijing. Staff yelled with a scary voice to buckle up when there was only a small wind blow and stopped movies at least 20 times per hour for the same reasons (very annoying) in a 13 hours flight.,,,,,
  Auckland to Beijing. Very poor customer service. My husband and I were not seated together for a 13 hour flight. When asked if we could be seated together we were refused. I was also flying with a sprained knee and had asked for an isle seat. I was again refused and placed in a middle seat which made it really difficult to to stand up and get in and out. Staff were unwilling to help and really didn’t care,,,,,
"  Newark to Mumbai via Beijing. The seats are small. On one flight if you had empty seats next to you , you couldn't move the arm rest to recline. Most of the crew were cold and abrupt. It seemed if I asked for something I was bothering them. You would think the food would be good. It wasn't, no frills. Cheap cold sandwiches, and rice and meat, with seaweed and imitation fish? I was seated next to a male that wanted to flirt it seemed. Since I was very uninterested, he just leaned and leered the whole flight instead. I moved to the 2 empty seats next to me, and a stewardess can over and told me the seats were for the crew, which they didn't use. Halfway through the 13hr flight a couple attempts to use the seats. They saw me alert the flight attendant, and then change their story saying she was sick. She was allowed to stay there, which was rubbish. On my first leg of me trip I had to stand for most of my 13hr flight. The price was good, and you get what you pay for! Next time I will afford better.",,,,,
"  Beijing to Phnom Penh return on an A321. The flight pushed back 10 minutes ahead of schedule. This was one of the nicer flights I've experienced on a narrow-body. First a few negatives - This is an old style Business Class seat (2x2) with no seat back monitors - just the overhead drop down TV which was useless, despite headphones supplied. Safety announcements were made by one crew member reading out from her note book (turning the pages swiftly) and the other demonstrating. However, the seat was comfortable with plenty of leg room. The cabin crew were just fantastic. Slippers were opened and handed to each passenger and informed of the flight time and seemed genuinely happy to serve. Hot towels were provided on boarding followed by a welcome fruit cocktail. I was then offered a second drink of Champagne. Drinks menus were handed out but no food menu. It was a choice of Western or Chinese main course and I opted for the Chinese meal. I was then offered a choice of drinks from the bar (a single malt whisky for me), and Chinese White Wine to go with the food. 20 minutes into the flight the bar service began. Dinner was served and the main fish course was very tasty. I was able to taste the wine first before pouring the rest. Again, refills followed. The desert was a strange cake like thing which I was not keen on. Later it was coffee and Cognac, and more refills followed! After the meal, I asked if I could keep the nice red chopsticks. They took the used ones away and returned with an unopened pair plus a souvenir Panda gift. As it was a night flight, the cabin was dimmed, but the crew checked on the passengers if there was anything else we wanted. During the 5 hour flight despite the little recline on the seat, I was able to nod off to about an hour. On the return flight, which also left on time, a Chinese breakfast was served with Dim Sum and Congee - very tasty. Even though the hard product was out of date, the cabin crew were pleasant and engaging.",,,,,
"  London to Beijing return.  Boarding was smooth and on time. I was welcomed and shown to my window seat. These are the old style (2x2x2), with the window seat having no direct aisle access. The small fixed partition between the seats offered a little privacy, but only when full flat. The seat itself was very comfortable and the adjustments were easy to operate. Following a welcome Champagne drink and hot towel, the menus were handed out. The announcements included a clear warning/advise for passenger behaviour on board. The cabin was half full. While taxing, a crew member came to take my dinner order. Although there was a choice of three main courses, I was told they had only one choice for dinner and breakfast left!  For dinner,  small appetisers were served, followed by a seafood starter, salad and hot breads. The main fish course was OK but a little bland. However, a desert trolley came along and I was able to choose what I liked, and settled for cheese/crackers and ice cream. Plenty to eat, but not that great. The wine served was good, and topped up several times, before coffee and cognac. One of the crew came to apologise for the lack of choice in the food, but it was not a major issue. What impressed me was the smiling and attentive attitude of the crew. I have read negative reviews about Air China complaining about the lack of English spoken. But for me, that is the charm of communicating with others who may not be so perfect in other languages. I really enjoyed my flight, especially the friendly cabin crew. A large pillow and thick blanket was provided for sleeping. The IFE was not fantastic, with a very limited number of English movies. The L'Occitane amenity kit was also basic. On the 10 hour flight, I managed about 4 hours sleep. On my return flight, the sound quality of the announcements was poor, and I could hardly understand a word spoken. Yet it didn't deter me from enjoying a relaxing time. Considering Air China's low pricing in Business Class, I would fly them again. Lovely cabin crew and comfortable seat, overcame the minor shortcomings.",,,,,
"  Hong Kong to Beijing. The ground handling and boarding process wasn't the smoothest - the flight was delayed, and Air China tends to operate out of remote terminal boarding gates which require a shuttle ride or extensive walking times. Everything was fine once we were airborne. The staff were attentive and the seats offered a reasonable amount of legroom, even though they seemed narrower than usual. The Air China A321 does not have personal IFE, they still use the archaic communal IFE systems. Food was average at best. Keep your expectations in line with prices paid, and you should be fine.",,,,,
  Rome to Sydney via Beijing. Terrible experience with the unprofessional behaviour with my child who traveled as an unaccompanied minor. After being told our child would be looked after in the Beijing airport we discovered he was made to sit in an office on an office chair for hours on end with no assistance or food. We had booked a lounge and it was not offered. The level of supervision was atrocious. He was let out with an unknown passenger who offered food and water. We will never deal with this airline again. They continue to deny any lack of duty of care towards the child.,,,,,
" Shanghai to Singapore via Beijing with Air China. Ridiculous Airline. 1) Flight delayed. Technical issues. Lady at counter extremely unhelpful. I am risking my connection flight from Beijing. 2) My food options not updated so I will go hungry. 3) No checks for business vs economy class. 4) Made everyone wait for 40 minutes before opening boarding gates. Dont rely on the time they provide on the boarding pass. For 11.55 flight, they opened boarding gates at 10.50! 5. Unhygienic toilets. Not cleaned even after asking. 6) Soap missing from toilet.",,,,,
"  Los Angeles to Tokyo via Beijing. First and foremost, the service received was incredibly poor.  As our flight date came closer, we began double checking our flight information before we realized our seats were not listed on our tickets. This was an issue as I purposely paid extra to choose seats so we could of course sit together. After hours of being on hold trying to reach customer service via phone, it ended up being a waste of time as the line just disconnects. We decided to deal with it in person as we could never get a hold of a customer service rep. via phone. But low and behold, after arriving to our terminal gate, our seats were mixed up and we were seated separately. The rest of the ride is downhill from here. Need I say more, do not take your chances and be persuaded by the ticket prices and flight times. Stay away from this airline and pay more for more popular airlines.",,,,,
" Air China canceled my flight, which was the only nonstop flight between Beijing and Datong, without any particular reason and re-booked me on the same flight the following day, so I had to cut back my itinerary in Datong. I arrived at Beijing Capital Airport very early in the morning (much earlier than recommended by my Beijing hotel concierge) to find that the terminal check-in area was super crowded. Many customers looked very confused about self-check-in as ones were required to print boarding passes at check-in kiosks, and then to repeat the same process to print luggage tags at the bag drop area. I was able to print my boarding pass but the luggage tag machine could not read my passport, and no staff was found for help. After roughly one hour running around, I finally found a special check-in area tucked away on the other side of the terminal where I could check my luggage and rushed to make my flight. In-flight staff were nice, but there was no IFE. Despite all of the above, I still recommend the airlines as my flight departed and arrived on-time. Also, this was not the first time I use Air China, and my experience was that their pilots consistently executed very smooth take-offs and landings.",,,,,
"  Copenhagen to Tokyo via Beijing. Food from the catering services in Beijing is substandard. Entertainment system quite dated and not working well. Lots of mechanical noise in the cabin. Lastly, the selection of refreshments in the business lounge in Beijing is rather poor.",,,,,
"  Beijing to San Francisco. I buy a Premium Economy ticket. On the return flight from Beijing to SFO they print my boarding pass and arriving on board I realize this is coach. I inquire and they say ""no Premium Economy on this flight"", I presume they changed the equipment. I call Air China to obtain a refund of the price difference. Now they say ""You have to call Beijing"". They have my flight coupons and itinerary. What else do they need? This is an example in ""how to make it difficult for a customer to obtain a legitimate refund"" It's a shame as the flight itself was not disastrous. The LA based call center agent finally sorted my case and I received a refund. She called me back several times to keep me informed. I felt this was a good recovery from a rather negatively engaged case.

"  Vienna to Wenzhou via Beijing. The crew was friendly, especially when you can speak Chinese but in general are very polite and helpful. The food was okay, for me it was a little bit boring and tasteless. The entertainment system onboard isn’t the best. The display gets very warm and doesn't react to all my commands. There is no wifi available. Air China certainly isn’t the best but it also not the worst airline.",,,,,
"  Bangkok to Barcelona via Beijing. Absolutely atrocious and an experience never to be repeated. The quality and standard of service prior to travel was non existent. The quality of the plane and standard on in flight service was very poor. On arrival at Barcelona, I was informed that my Baggage was left in Beijing. 3+ days later my bag was delivered broken.  Total compensation 18 euros. My expenses for the 3 days were greater than 18 euros, and how they think I can replace the bag for 18 euros is beyond me. Never Again. There are plenty of far superior alternatives. Was it cheap? Yes - but cheap usually means cheap and nasty - which it most definitely was.",,,,,
" Vienna to Beijing. The service is very friendly and kind, especially when you can speak Chinese, but in general, they are always polite and helpful also in the economy class. The food is OK for me it’s too tasteless and boring, my family said that the food was “edible”. The Entertainment system in front of you is not the best, often it doesn’t react to your touch commands. The movie selection was quite decent there are western and Chinese films. On the Airbus 330-300 there is no Wifi. Honestly, I don’t know if there is wifi in other plane types of this airline but on the airbus 330-300 there is no connectivity. All in all, Air China certainly isn’t the best airline, but it is also not the worst airline.",,,,,
"  Sydney to Madrid via Beijing. OK for the price. Their website is very difficult to use, their cabin staff only perfunctory, and the onboard experience lacking. The aircraft were reasonable with seatback screens but the movie choice was very limited and the system slow and hard to navigate, especially with the oddly placed armrest controls. My 777 screen stopped working entirely after 7 hours. The flight attendants did not appear to be happy, warm or welcoming. Their English was passable but their pronunciation poor so cabin announcements are difficult to understand. Beer is available on the drinks round but wine is only available with meals and they like to give you 1/3 of a cup. Asking for a second glass was not received well. The meals were tiny. Taste was good but they sometimes served the same dishes twice per flight. I booked a transit hotel in Beijing both ways, but the process was cumbersome even after I spoke to their call centre. Both ways it took 3 hours to get the transit visa and go through immigration and customs, so be prepared. The Air China service desk is through customs at the door to the terminal. The hotels were quite good but there was nothing nearby either of them. If you have a very cheap fare and do not mind a long break mid trip in PEK then Air China are an option, but other airlines will probably do the job better for not much more money.",,,,,
" I had serious concerns about this airline before taking my trip, but ended up having a very good experience. So I promised myself I will write a review about it. Best value for money: what caused me to book was the offer of flying a flat bed C-class seat from JFK to Shanghai for $2,200 (return tkt), only with a quick stopover of 90 minutes in PEK. Pre-flight concerns: - I kept receiving automated emails from the airline that my itinerary has changed and that I should contact them and I can change/get a refund for my tkt. The small change that happened once was a 5 minute change in departure time which increased my layover in PEK (good thing, since you need those 90 minute to transfer) - customer service: it's impossible to reach them by phone, the line is not manned. So I emailed them. They responded within 24hrs (or so) and said that my flight's transfer time in PEK is too short and my tkt needs to be changed. But when I went online I saw that my same exact flight itinerary was still being sold on various websites, incl. airchina.us. - The inconsistent response from their customer service really got me worried about the reliability of this airline, so I did some more research online on helpful reviews. I mostly read terrible reviews on how delayed the flights were, people missing their connections and being treated very poorly. That's when I got really worried about having booked this ticket, but figured I will take the risk. Also TPG wrote a fairly good review on them, so that felt comforting. Flight: - Outbound: upper deck of Boeing 747, half empty cabin. Seat was perfectly comfortable (flat bed). Service was smooth, food was good/fine - meat a bit chewy. Staff are friendly and helpful, though be aware they only speak limited english. - Inbound: Boeing 777-300 - full cabin. Seat perfectly comfortable (flat bed). Service was great, they accommodated my specific food requests despite not having ordered in advance. Overall a great flying experience. - All flights were pretty much on time - In-flight entertainment is ok, limited movies selection / limited music selection - no WIFI. Transfers in PEK: - 90 minutes is definitely needed if transferring. You need to take a quick 'airtrain' trip from domestic to intl., even if you don't change Terminals. The connecting flight to and from SHA was a tarmac parked aircraft with bus transfers, so that added time as well. I was traveling with filming equipment and I've never had to spend that much time at security, unpacking my entire bag with all the equipment and letting it run several times through the x-ray.",,,,,
"  Bangkok to San Francisco via Shanghai. What a nightmare. Staff did not recognize my Star alliance status and told me to que with the rest of the chaotic crowd. Seats are tight and the food is less than mediocre. To make matters worse, you have to go through customs in Shanghai, even though you are transiting. Never again",,,,,
" Beijing to Ho Chi Minh City. This was my maybe 10th flight on different routes with Air China and again a really bad experience. Splitting the 4 people (1 infant, one 2 years old, 2 adults) to 3 different seats across plane can happen. But I would at least expect that ground staff would try to solve it. Attitude of the ground staff was that they do not actually care - in their words ""we can do nothing with it"". It is OK when the system screws it up but then I expect staff to work towards the customer service, not to let a 2 years old sit alone. In the end we solved it ourselves on the plane thanks to other nice passengers but again Air China staff didn't helped much. Overall service and quality of plane was as well poor. Food is most of the time badly smelling and taste is low quality. Inflight entertainment almost none and even the magazinnes are mainly in Chinese.",,,,,
"  London to Phnom Penh via Beijing. Not the newest of aircraft but plenty of space (due to old style 3-3-3 seating rather than 3-4-3 favoured by many airlines). Acceptable food (better than BA but not to Emirates or Qatar standard). In flight service efficient and staff on both flight were keen to help and engage with passengers. I was particularly impressed with the Purser and Crew on our second flight who handled the cabin very well and professionally during turbulence and showed  care when dealing with passengers.  I would put air China somewhere above the volume US Airlines (who  tend to serve food in boxes), around BA but below the Middle East airlines. For the price point (circa £450 round trip) they are very good.",,,,,
"  Vancouver to Bejing. When we arrived in Beijing we had a 8 hour stopover. We toured the Airport and arrived back at our gate about  1 hour before departure. We heard a Chinese Announcement about flight to Manila and repeated by a very bad English. When we approached our gate about 3 mins later than boarding, we were informed we missed the flight. The plane had not left terminal. ",,,,,
"  Los Angeles to Shanghai via Beijing. The flight arrived late into Beijing and I missed the connecting flight to Los Angeles. They made everyone wait in an area for forty minutes, then put everyone in a bus that got lost twice and took ninety minutes to get to a hotel. No food was provided, my bathroom had no shower door and had a clogged sink. I was the only Caucasian amongst all Chinese. Not a word of English was spoken. When flying from Los Angeles to Shanghai five days earlier the same thing occurred. My flight from Shanghai to Beijing was cancelled due to weather and I was forced to spend the night in Beijing. Rather than accept their accommodation I took the money they offered, forty six dollars and found a four star hotel that cost $250. Air Canada had its passengers stay at the same, pricey but reasonable, hotel. The following day, after spending three hours on the tarmac, without any communication from the pilots, the flight finally departed for Shanghai. Returning from Shanghai I was wiser but no less lucky. My flight from Shanghai to Beijing showed that it would be delayed and I knew I would miss my connecting flight to Los Angeles. An hour prior to the flight leaving I informed the airline staff that I would miss my connecting flight and requested they instead arrange another one. I even showed them flight options on my phone. The answer was no answer. I had to take the flight or be left on my own in Shanghai, not knowing what would happen. I took the flight to Beijing and was then taken to the hotel. I kept asking myself, why can’t Air China run some very simple regression analysis to determine the chances of customers making flights given variables like seasonal weather patterns and historic flight delays. The only answer I could come up with was they either do not think it is important or do not know how to do it. Why do airports in China suffer some of the longest delays in the world? As mentioned in the Economist, “The first reason is that its airports err on the side of extreme safety.” This is consistent with state run ideology. Play it safe. No mistakes, and you won’t get in trouble. According the South China Morning Post, “Like the rest of the world, the biggest cause of delays according to CAAC is the weather, which accounted for 56 percent of flight delays ” No one thinks this excuse is legitimate.

"  Milan to Fukuoka via Beijing. Bad Service. I booked a kosher meal for the flight. The flight attendant didn't checked the special meals, trying to serve me same as others. When I asked for the special meal, she returned to the galley and brought me an open box though it was written on it in big letters that it must be open ONLY BY THE PERSON WHO REQUESTED THE MEAL. DO NOT EAT IF IT WAS OPEN BY SOMEONE ELSE. After I complained, the flight service manager briefly apologized for the ""little"" mistake, returned to the galley and after a while brought me a small plate with a piece of a fish and salad from the business class. He was in a good mood, laughing, and obviously not comprehending why I refuse to accept the food, saying repeatedly that it was much better than my kosher meal. As a result, I was left without food. How could such a person be a flight attender MANAGER? I have never felt such humiliation and ignorance of passenger needs. Shame on Air China for the service! In addition to being left without food for a 10 hours flight, I got my checked luggage (a hard suitcase) at the destination destroyed by 4 big cracks.",,,,,
"  I have just used Air China for the first time and had a horrible experience. We traveled to Beijing from Houston late October with tickets bought in May. Our return to Houston was scheduled for October. We arrived at the airport to be told the flight was canceled due to aircraft problems to be told the following day that was a lie. Apparently, for financial reasons Air China canceled both Friday and Sunday flights months ago but didn’t tell everybody. Now changing a very long, costly international flight is already a very poor customer service, but not making absolutely sure everyone realizes such a major change has happened is the worst I have ever seen in an airline. To make matters worse we had to fight to get a hotel and were sent to a very very poor, dirty one. Food was promised to be included but we got there only the buffet consisting of cold chicken nuggets and old eggs were included. Real food had to be paid. When every airline would be trying to make it up, since it was not my fault the flight was changed, getting a nice hotel and food, and an upgrade, Air China simply got us even worse service. I also had to buy my own food since the option was not edible. I travel a lot, have used multiple American and European airlines, being frequent flyer on several. Air China is the worse. Ever.",,,,,
"  Air China is the worst airline ever, their customer service is inexistent, they do not answer calls. On hold for over 2 hours each time and half their Phone numbers for customer service do not work / are paying. Their premium economy is a complete rip-off, you basically get the same seat as economy with one seat next to you empty. I will never fly this airline again and do not recommend anyone to fly it. With this type of customer service.",,,,,
" Houston to Beijing. The flight was good, but not the customer services and the website. The website is confusing even when we typed in the correct/exact ticket # and name it did not recognize our name and we can't do anything online for any change. Also when requesting the mileage to be added to my other Star Alliance frequent flyer # the customer representative behaved very rudely and without any courtesy, made me wonder who actually is the customer here. Will not fly with them again.",,,,,
"  Frankfurt to Shanghai with Air China. Terrible service at check in counter and terrible online check in. They would not let me pick a seat online. They said many people have the same problem. I was at the counter 5 hours before the flight to check in. They gave me the worst seat in the front row and did not ask. Luckily there were better empty seats behind me, so I switched. So stupid that they don’t care enough even about business class customers to offer them a good seat. At least on the plane they were better. ",,,,,
" Islamabad to Melbourne via Beijing. My overall experience was horrible. Air China may be good value for money but be prepared for all the troubles and headaches that you will face with this airline from their uncomfortable seats, not working monitors, stained and smelly seat covers, delayed departure (one day) to loss of baggage. With Air China you are like a guinea pig you don't know where the flight is taking you, you cannot communicate with anyone in China if you don't speak Chinese. Long story short - flight took off to get passengers from Karachi but diverted back being 5mins to land to Islamabad and finally took off again one day late from the city of origin Islamabad, arrived one day late in Beijing (transit) of course the connecting flight was missed because of the airline. Failed to accommodate me or compensate for anything - just gave 350 CNY = $50 AUD to spend 13 hours in Beijing airport. Resting charge minimum starts 180 CNY per hour and 165 CNY to take a shower. My luggage had to stay in Beijing as I couldn't pass through customs, the airline failed to get me my luggage and asked me to claim it lost when I get home while my luggage was one floor away. Spent 13 hours on a bench in Beijing then they arranged for me to take a flight from Hong Kong to Melbourne as there were no flights for the next 3 days from Beijing itself (according to airline) however there were many flights. So all the way to Hong Kong the airport closed while we were in the air - I understand the situation but Air China lands in a city (Shenzhen) where they don't have any staff, any counter, any office or anything related to Air China. So I was again stuck in Shenzhen immigration. Immigration was forcing me to contact the airline, on many attempts by using the officer's phone I failed to get through, the immigration gave up and forced me to buy the earliest flight possible from Shenzhen to get out of the airport. For 12 hours stuck in 3x3 meter spot, no one from Ari China showed up to help or look for the passenger who is their responsibility to arrange accommodation for and arrange the flights for. After 12 hours Shenzhen immigration officers forces me to buy a ticket and claim it back from Air China as we did not hear anything from them. Coming back home after and seeking reimbursement, took 45 days Air China offered TCV Transportation Credit Voucher to spend only with Air China within 12 months. Like are you kidding me, this travel I had was after 3 years and I know for the next 2 years I am not traveling anywhere so their TCV meant nothing but gas and air, after telling them I will not be traveling for the next 12 months they suggest I give the TCV to a friend or family. Like seriously is this some sort of a joke. I was forced to buy another ticket twice more expensive than the entire return trip while I had already paid for one and Air China failed to provide any assistance and service for, they ask me to pass the voucher to family and friend. I earned that money, it is a whole month worth of rent to pay here in Australia and they ask me to pass it to a family or friend. None of my friends or family would ever travel with an irresponsible airline after what I had been through took me 4 days to get home (Melbourne). I do not recommend anyone to fly with Air China. Seriously, pay $100 more and fly with a decent airline that covers their shits and takes responsibility.as",,,,,
"  Beijing to Paris. One of the worst customer experience before and during the flight, shameful for a so-called ""national"" airline. Online check-in has always be a struggle and you can expect you will not be able to walk straight away to your gate like any other company ; going at the counter is mandatory to get your boarding pass even without luggage to drop. Poor in-flight experience too : outdated IFE with only about a third of movies subtitled in English, food limited to the regular services and a few packs of free snacks that are quickly taken as soon as the flight attendants put them at disposition. Definitely will rely on other companies for future flights in & to China.",,,,,
"  Oslo to Manila via Beijing. I have used Air China Business Class several times, and have booked again now for Christmas. We travel frequently and have tried several airline's Business Class on long journeys. Air China is the most value for money we can get. I have never experienced delays or lost luggage with them. The lounge in Beijing can be a little below standard with other Business Lounges. The staff have so far been nice, the planes have been clean, the food is  good. Film selection could be better (for English readers). So instead of paying 2,500 Euro for a Business ticket, I pay 1,500 Euro. So for my travels, this is the best you can get for a reasonable price.",,,,,

"  Beijing to London. After I got off the plane, I found no baggage, I found that there was no result for about two hours, and there was a suitcase that was exactly the same as my suitcase. Brand, model, color are the same) has been unclaimed. After the airport staff said that let me ""contact Air China, Air China has passenger contact information"" and gave a baggage agency company list file number, and said it would help find, after the exit my son to China Air China The phone was transferred to the baggage office, and then my son suggested that the airline contact the owner of the unclaimed box. Then the customer service said, ""Sorry, our airline does not have the customer's contact information, but we recorded the file."" And said it twice. My son contacted GBS baggage agency at 7:30 pm London time on the 29th. During the exchange, the staff called ""this passenger took the wrong baggage"", but the baggage was not found. After that, I called again at 11.59 in the evening. The customer service still said that if there was any problem, ""please contact the London airport"", after my repeated questioning, the customer service changed the name and said ""Contact China Air China's partner company at the London airport"" Third-party outsourcing companies are completely unable to provide effective and reasonable solutions. When it comes to allowing Air China’s partner companies in London to reply to the process of this incident every day, the customer service said that ""no permission, no idea, only message"", in my After mentioning the compensation, the customer service said that “the baggage will be searched for within 21 days. If the baggage is not found after 21 days, the baggage tag will be lost and the airport will be compensated.” But as far as I know, it is only passive waiting to find the baggage. The person who got the wrong baggage contacted the airport, but until now, Air China did not receive the wrong number of luggage.",,,,,
"  Rome to Bangkok via Beijing. We had 2 problems with this airline, and recommend you to try to fly with another company. Beijing to Bangkok with scheduled departure at 2:15 PM; when we reached the gate, nothing was written about a potential delay; after 1 hour (at 3:20 PM) I went to the desk, and the girl said to me these words: “flight is in delay, no more info available”, so we didn’t know when it was going to depart, and not even the cause. Long story short, after going several times to the gate desk with nothing or poor answers given, the flight departed at 6:50 PM, and landed at 11:50 PM (scheduled at 6:35 PM). Had the most terrible Customer Care Assistance experience: return flight from Bangkok to Rome, we had a transfer of 7,5 hours at Beijing, and reading at the company’s policy we saw that we had the right to have an hotel room. I tried multiple times to book it via web site, but it always crashed (I tried something like 50 times in 2 weeks); called the hotline, and after 6 minutes it always would go down (payed money for every call); at Bangkok, we asked for help (before doing the check in), and they said that they couldn’t do anything, and that at Beijing for sure they would’ve fixed. Landed at Beijing, we went to the Lounge, cause Air China Desks were not present (as in Bangkok), and the only thing that the girl at the desk did was call the hotline (really, I am not joking); at the hotline, they said 3 different things: 1) first, that we needed to book the hotel at least 2 weeks before 2) then, that we had to book the hotel at least 24 hours before 3) in the end, that their policy is to book at least before checking in after a 1,5 hour call, in the end, I even tried to ask if it was at least possible to stay in the lounge, and they said: “sure, but you’ll have to pay”. One last thing, the girl's supervisor at the hotline didn't speak English, only Mandarin. After what I’ve been through, I will stay as much away as possible from this company, and I advise all of you to do the same. Embarrassing company.",,,,,
  Vancouver to Islamabad via Beijing. One of the worst airline experience. First delayed or lost luggage for 3 weeks. Then 2 piece completely damaged. They are offering free hotel outside Bejing Airport but it's scam since they know that airport would not let you out at all. We were family of 5 and stuck at airport for 24 hours among lot other families. Transit lounge booking is also pathetic. Bad food seats and customer service. No or very few English - great barrier. They offer cheap rates but worst service.,,,,,

" Beijing to San Francisco. Never ever have flown on a worst flight. Flight attendants don’t care. They were constantly just talking and laughing with each other instead of taking care of the passengers. We had constant delays with no explanation of why. I will say that they were very kind and let my friend and I sit together on every flight. But in Beijing, we had a 20-hour layover from Bangkok. Which is fine but they said that our luggage would go straight to San Francisco. And after 3 straight days of traveling we got to SF and it wasn’t there. The guy helping us asked if we had a quick transfer of flights and when we told him we had a 20 hour lay over he was shocked. They had 20-hours to get the bags on the plane. Now I can’t contact anyone because they keep giving me a disconnected number. So I have no idea where our bags are or if they are even coming here.",,,,,
"  Singapore to New York via Beijing in Economy. Total fare was SGD 847, by far the cheapest option at the time of booking. The SIN-PEK flight I had selected was cancelled more than a month before the trip, with an earlier and later flight offered. All flights departed and arrived on time. The legroom and pitch were acceptable, and the adjustable head and calf-rests were much appreciated. The level of cleanliness was generally good, with cleaning of the lavatories by the cabin crew. A decent selection of English content available in the IFE system, though the touchscreen was insensitive and the audio jacks and headphones had to be cajoled into producing even tinny, monaural sound. My pre-ordered vegetarian meal was not loaded onto the SIN-PEK flight due to the schedule change, but the AVML and VLML meals on the other sectors were satisfactory. Each featured a small and rather underwhelming entrée along with a rotating ensemble of sides, including Häagen-Dazs ice cream and Upstate Farms yogurt on the EWR-PEK sector. A selection of soft drinks and Chinese wine and beer were offered during regular drink runs. The onboard service was polite and efficient. One issue was that the layovers were extremely long. However, Air China offers Economy passengers with long layovers free transit lounge access. Though the contracted BCAT lounge was basic, it proved very useful on the return leg. In summary, Air China offered extremely affordable and reasonably comfortable transportation.",,,,,
"  Los Angeles to Singapore with a layover in Beijing. Quick & Dirty. Difficult to book flight. Online booking only. No mobile app. Aircraft dirty cloth seats, dirty monitor. Stolen luggage lock. Lost Luggage. Bad communication. This was by far the most nerve wrecking booking experience I've ever had! I travel frequently and decided to fly Air China despite the bad reviews and of course because of the lower price - won't do that again. I literally had to book the flight 3 times online because, for some reason, my transaction didn't go through. I know this because I called customer service (after being on hold for at least 20 minutes) and was informed. You'd think that would be enough to make me do an about-face. The aircraft had cloth seats with touch monitors that did not respond to touch. It wouldn't be so bad if I weren't on a 12 hour flight! The monitors and tray tables were visibly dirty. But I'm not trippin' because most aircraft are (whether visible or invisible) so I brought my handy-dandy antibacterial wipes. We were a lost luggage victim as well. Luggage didn't even leave LAX! Thank God the luggage arrived in Singapore 24 hours later -  our luggage lock wasn't on our luggage.  We sat on the tarmac for 1.5 hours before take-off (in Beijing). No explanation given until about an hour of sitting and waiting.  Needless to say, we will not be flying Air China again.",,,,,
"  Frankfurt to Jakarta via Beijing. Nightmare flight! For an affordable airline I was not expecting too much. Because of nationality (Brazilian living in Germany) I could not make the online check in. Therefore, I could not mark any option for special meal request, as I am allergic to sea food, I usually like to order the vegetarian meal to be on a safe side. My flights from Frankfurt - Beijing - Jakarta were fine. There was a long layover in Beijing and they offer free transit lounge use. I would like to highlight here that the ""propaganda"" in the website about the lounge is already misleading. You are limited to a dark and often noisy and crowded area. I ended up preferring to stay in the airport. But my flight back from Beijing to Frankfurt was a complete nightmare. The crew were serving sea food. I called the air attendants and told them that I have a really strong allergy and the smell was already causing an allergic reaction. I faced a completely unprepared and careless crew. They didn't let me to leave my sit and just gave me tissues! I told them several times that I just needed to find a place away from the smell. I had to stay there, barely breathing and feeling sick the whole flight. Additionally, the service is super slow, food is bad and entertainment options are limited. Never will fly again with them!",,,,,
"  Tokyo Haneda to Rome via Beijing. I find this airline within average, with no substantial difference with more expensive carriers. The ticket price is the lowest overall, but service isn't as bad nonetheless. Sometimes on-board personnel have an overworked outlook. Food maybe not top of the class, but not bad either. Economy seats are economy seats, no much to be done about it. If I had to find a couple of minuses, one is the animosity of some passengers, and a second would be the rather limited choice of the IFE movies and TV shows (most are Chinese-only Chinese productions)",,,,,
"  New York to Bangkok via Beijing. I've been traveling for years and this is the 1st and last time I will ever use them. I just got married and my husband and I planned a 2 month honeymoon to Asia. We purchased a round trip from JFK with a layover in Beijing before arriving in Bangkok. The return flight was from Hong Kong with layover in Beijing before landing in Newark, NJ. Our flight in April to Bangkok experienced multiple delays which caused us to miss our layover in Beijing by 5 minutes. We actually had a 75 mins layover in Beijing, but due to the delays, we and almost everyone else on our plane missed our transfers. They couldn't tell their other planes to wait 5-10 mins for everyone to make their flights?? Instead, we saw most of the fliers crowded around the Air China counter. Everyone had to get a temporary visa and herd onto their buses to spend a night in a disgusting, filthy motel because the next flights out were the following day. My husband and I missed our 1st night in Bangkok and of course weren't reimbursed in any way. Throughout the ordeal, we saw all of the passengers at the Air China counters and they, like us, were appalled and furious with their lack of customer service. They just don't care. Now for our flight returning back to NY from Hong Kong on 6/17. We received an email saying that Air China changed our flights so we called Chase Travel. We saw that they changed the planes, times and moved us from Premium Economy to Economy. Why? We paid the extra amount for Economy. Once on the phone with Chase, we selected another flight for 7:30AM that was Premium Economy. We even waited on the phone until we received the email confirmation from Chase for our new flights. So on 6/17 we get to HK airport to check in and they only have my husband's name and not mine. Air China said I was on a 11PM flight and that it was Chase's fault. That was not the case. My husband and I spent hours on the phone with Chase and Air China, and Air China were the ones to cancel my ticket (we have no idea why). Instead of just putting me on the 7:30AM flight, they kept my husband on hold for 50 minutes, then finally told him that they could change his flight for $4000 to be with me for the 11PM. How does that make sense? Why are we being punished for Air China's mistake? They changed our flights then split us up but putting us on different flights that land in different airports. Then they have the audacity to tell him to pay $4000 for him to be on the 11PM when they could've just put me on the 7:30AM which was confirmed. They could have even put us on the next Air China flight after that. My husband ended up purchasing completely new flights with EVA which was $2800 compared to the $2500 round trip with Air China! It's now 7/25 and I've been on the phone with Chase for almost 4.5 hours because the supervisor is trying to get Air China to give us a refund. Rather than admitting their fault and giving us the credit owed, they are trying to contest it.  We, the passengers, mean nothing to them.",,,,,
" Paris CDG to Beijing with Air China. First time flying First Class ever and the experience was just perfect. It was an evening flight and I hadn't been eating all day so the minute I stepped onto the plane I asked if they had cup noodles on board. The flight attendant immediately offered to make me one before the plane took off. So I ended up eating the best convenient noodles I've had. Other than that the service was overall very attentive and prompt. Also I really enjoyed the wine, both red and white. One thing I'd like to note is that the movie selection was quite narrow and not updated frequently (basically the same from the May selection).",,,,,
" Auckland to London via Beijing with Air China. The air stewardesses were extremely attentive and pleasant. Kept topping up my wine. Offering food. Food was good. Bed on 787-9 had very limited foot room and not overly comfortable. ‘First Class’ lounge and food in Beijing pretty average. Inflight entertainment needs more, better English movies and docos. Stewardess gave me a ‘Fast Track’ priority immigration pass for Heathrow. Brilliant! Straight through.",,,,,
  This airline treated us very bad. My flight was from Mumbai to Beijing to Montréal. But my Mumbai to Beijing got delayed and I missed my flight to Montréal and then they told us that they will arrange a flight but we have to get our bags from I don't know where which was too far from the gates and we ended up missing the flight. After that when we got our bags they gave us the flight to Vancouver and then to Montréal. Literally I had spent 100$ to upgrade to premium economy and 1025 rupees to get a window seat and they gave us the middle seat and it was so horrible that I would not suggest anyone to travel by it. Instead go buy a more expensive ticket and get a comfortable seat.,,,,,
"  Cheapest business class ticket from London to Hong Kong via Beijing. Even though I normally take direct flights, the price was too good to pass up. Excellent Ground Crew in LHR and HKG. Onboard service was friendly and helpful although I agree that not all the staff can speak adequate English. Food was copious as was alcohol. Entertainment catalogue was adequate for English movies although they could do with more.  Sound dampening headphones worked well. Lots of warm towels to keep you refreshed. The lie-flat bed was comfortable and I awoke refreshed after my flight. Would fly with them again, hopefully on their new A350!",,,,,
"  Return flights from London to Bangkok via Beijing booked with Air China seemed a good price deal, but you get what you pay for! Bag delayed on outward journey and airline ‘insisted’ it had to be delivered to my hotel at 3am off a following flight meaning the hotel owner had to get up to receive it, despite being told later on would be more acceptable. In flight ‘entertainment’ was laughable, I’ve never seen such an antiquated system, a total waste of time and definite breach of the word entertainment. Return flight Beijing to London departed around 7am, an 11 hour flight. Weather was clear and sunny, again the above ‘entertainment’ system which resulted in looking out of the window at the views below to pass the time, or should I say ‘trying to’, was repeatedly asked by cabin crew to close my blind, when I asked why (thinking maybe we were flying over a restricted area etc) I was told people were trying to sleep - apparently Air China think it is ok for passengers not sleeping on a long haul day flight to sit in a completely dark cabin for 11 hrs with no in flight entertainment and a low phone battery staring at the back of the headrest in front?! If you like either chicken/rice or shrimp/noodles you’ll be fine for food, otherwise enjoy the bread rolls I saw being offered as alternatives 5 Next time stick with Thai Airways.",,,,,
"  Munich to Hanoi via Beijing. Very unfriendly staff, outdated entertainment system, no english at the airport and very little by the cabin crew. Meal was worse than average. The plane from Beijing to Ha Noi was old and worn out. I would look for another options.",,,,,
"  I booked flight for my parents from Delhi to Vancouver via Beijing. I prebooked my father's wheelchair (he can not walk or stand for longer because of permanent leg injury) and their meals AVML since they are pure vegetarian. It was connecting flight through Beijing. All was going well until they reached Beijing. The wheelchair assist guy took advantage of their age and language barrier. He took them to gate no 32. He then asked for money. My parents told him that they couldn't understand, so he wrote on a paper in English that he wants money to take them to gate. They Didn't know what was happening, after trying to understand him they gave him 400 INR. He asked for more, my parents were not carrying more cash in their hand baggage so they denied outcome of which he left them at gate no 32 and went away saying something in Chinese which they clearly don't understand. They waited there for 2 hours and then my mother decided to go for a walk around and look for the gate number for their next flight because they eventually figured it out that they are stranded on wrong gate. She found a few Indians sitting near gate number 19 who guided her and told her that they are supposed to reach gate number 16 which was really not anywhere near gate number 32. She rushed back to my father and told him the scenario. They couldn't find any other ground staff near by who could understand them so she decided to take my father on a wheelchair by her own along with the 2 hand bags they were carrying. They made it till gate number 20 when someone showed up to help after maybe observing them struggling. The nightmare didn't end there, after taking off for next flight, they were offered Fish to eat. They told the crew that they are vegetarian (I booked AVML which is reflected on their tickets too) and can't eat fish. The crew told them that since there is no vegetarian option available, they have to either eat it or wait for landing to eat in Vancouver. They didn't eat for 12+ hours of flight.  I have read about people sharing their experience but never imagined that something like this could happen to my family. How does some big airlines do such kind of money business without having feelings for their passengers? ",,,,,
"  Bangkok to New York via Beijing. Ground staff is subpar and not helpful. I was traveling with my husband but we got seated separately despite there being some vacant seats available. Crew are not helpful and rarely speak English. Food portion is too small for an average man. The taste is bland but edible. Some good thing is that an ice cream is served on a long-haul flight. Entertainment on board is out of date and difficult to use. You have to select everything from a remote control attached to the seat. The flight from PEK to JFK delayed for more than 2 hours. I have checked the flight history and it looks like there is always some delay in this flight. Anyhow, the flight is dirt cheap. ",,,,,
" San Francisco to Mumbai via Beijing.  The flight was delayed by 2 hours from SFO due to the delay in incoming flight. However, the Beijing to Mumbai flight waited for the SFO to Beijing flight to arrive. No lost baggage and the FA went above and beyond to make us comfortable.",,,,,
" CA937 from Beijing to London: shameful ground service and excellent onboard services The ground service is an absolutely shame, failing to do any customer service, and even sound checking me in as a favor. Travelling with a toddler, the ground service is simply say she does not care to put us together, and it is our responsibility to check in early (we arrived the airport 3.5 hours before the flight). When checked the luggage, we are allowed to check in 3 23kg bags, but we only have 2 (20kg and 24kg respectively), the check in agent insists 24 kg is way too much, without realizing we have extra bag weight not used, and the weight per bag is not beyond 32kg - absolutely shame. Asking us to re-pack in front of the long queue, and force us to queue it again after rebalancing the stuff in the checked luggage. In contrast, the onboard service is fantastic. Seat ok with better than average leg room, entertainment improving, food is edible. However, the crew are exceptional, frequent water runs over the night, personal greeting (in economy), and also keep entertaining and interacting with our 22 months toddler, even the flight is completely full. Could not ask for more and absolute fantastic! Air China could be a 5 star airline if the ground staff has half of the professionalism as the crews. Overall highly recommended",,,,,
"  San Francisco to Mumbai via Beijing. Flight was delayed. They put me on a Lufthansa flight. I had purchased the ticket for 410 usd and paid 166 usd for an extra baggage. However, since they changed my flight to Lufthansa, I had to pay the Lufthansa extra baggage charges which was 287 usd. More than half my ticket price.  When I emailed Air China, and requested a refund of 166 usd plus the extra charges I had to pay to Lufthansa beyond the 166 usd, I received no reply to the email. (I received a refund of the 166 usd I had paid them). This is unethical business conduct and bad customer service !",,,,,
"  Tokyo to Paris via Shanghai. I expected the same budget experience like on the journey to Tokyo but it went worse. The ground experience at NRT was excellent. Quick check-in, security and passport controls, great ANA lounge, priority boarding for Star Alliance gold members. Greetings while boarding was not particularly friendly and so was the service also on the flight to PVG. The food was more than ok for this 2h30 flight. The real odyssee began at Shanghai airport... There was no visible sign for international transfers so I asked my way and was told to go first to the fingerprints collection and then to the regular immigration line. When it was my turn, the customs officer told me to fill in a blue form (for long layover without visa!). After a while there were more and more people to Paris asked to do so. But then someone told us that it's not necessary and we were asked to follow her up to the (well hidden) international transfer counter where we waited about 20-30 minutes. We were around 25 passengers to Paris waiting there until someone came to exchange our boarding passes against new ones (why?). Then all of us had to go back to the immigration counters to get their boarding passes stamped.,  before going back to the international transfer counter again for our boarding passes and passports getting checked once again. After that we still had to go through the long lines of security control. The whole procedure took over 2 hours ! There should have been trained Air China staff to help customers and the airport staff should known the process of international to international transfers and give the right information. If you book international to international you should count on 3 hours transit to be on the safe side. Our aircraft to Paris was on an apron position and we had to take a crowded bus: chaotic to board a large plane with only one stairway. FA were not particularly friendly but the service was quick and OK for a budget airline. The seats were also OK and the entertainment sytem also. We arrived slightly delayed in Paris. I wrote them a friendly e-mail to complain about the disastrous transfer in PVG and I received a short answer: 3 lines in very poor english. Not really giving the impression they care about frequent flyers and Star Alliance gold members. The ticket was cheap and for a very cheap price I would fly them again but only for a direct flight to China, not with an international transfer. For a flight to Tokyo again, I would pay 200-300€ more to fly Lufthansa or ANA: much better service inflight and on the ground, and much better customer service.",,,,,
"  Paris to Tokyo via Beijing. The price was great and I wanted to give the airline a chance and fly with them for the 1st time. Tickets not booked on their website: not able to choose seats or special meals. I contacted the airline per e-mail and I could order one special meal. I checked in the day before departure to be sure we sit together. Seating was 3-3-3 on the B777 if I'm right: better than the 3-4-3 on some airlines. Check-in opened around 3 hours before departure: the economy class line was very long. I'm Star Alliance Gold member and I could use the business class: pretty fast and checkin staff in Paris very friendly. But the seats I had checked in for the day before were not available anymore and I ended up on a middle seat. Boarding began 30 minutes later but we arrived on time at Beijing airport.  I was positively surprised about the service onboard. Well, it's just a short version of the service of Lufthansa, Turkish or ANA and they don't come as often with drinks during and after the service; you get plastic cutlery,... but it's OK for the price! The food was not a highlight but not bad. The flight attendants mostly friendly with a good understanding of english. They are quick to serve but don't expect too much interaction like you have with ANA or Lufthansa... They are here to serve not to answer questions. Inflight entertainment a bit old, not very responding, froze and had to be reset. The problem was the transfer from international to international: expect long lines for passport control (yes, they do have one) and security check. And no special line for gold members, business class. The line was huge and disorganized. Passengers with a European passports were eventually asked to bypass the main ine and line up for the automatized passport control, which was much quicker. Afterwards again disorganised line for security control. Lighters and larger power banks are not allowed. All electronic equipment (also Bluetooth headphones !) and wallets/purses had to be taken out of the bag... unfriendly staff. You should always calculate at least one hour and half for connecting flights. There is no smoking area at PEK airport, keep in this in mind if you book a long transit time. Air China business / gold lounge pretty full but OK (for the price again). The airport has several restaurants and many shops and is modern with big windows over the apron. Boarding to Tokyo HND began on time. The service for a 3 hour flight was good and quick, but not so friendly. The A321 was dirty: not only my tray table was dirty with stains (food, sauce?) and also the overhead bins and panels had grey stains. We arrived on time. Business class passengers and gold members didn't get their luggage before normal economy passengers. Overall I would say you pay for what you get. The inflight experience was satisfying but the ground progress at PEK changed my mind. For solo travellers ok with a cheap fare, not for families or business travellers.",,,,,
"  San Francisco to Mumbai via Beijing with Air China. Business class was good for the price you pay, but not worth the delays. The food was good - lots of sea food and steak. (Very limited options for vegetarians though). My connecting flight to Mumbai was delayed by over 5 hours at Beijing. We spent hours circling around in the airport runways, taxing then circling around again. So a 6 hour flight to Mumbai turned to 11 hours. Really frustrating. The airline staff didn’t give any proper updates for the delays. The delays seem to be common at airports in China. No WiFi in plane. Changed my return flight to American Airlines via Hong Kong.",,,,,
"  I took my flight from New York to Bombay via Beijing. First the flight got delayed for 1.5 hour at JFK airport then it got delayed at Beijing airport for another 4 hours, when plane was on runway at Beijing airport the it stopped there and took a halt for 2 hours and they stated the reason that there is no fuel in the plane. This is very negligent on a part of international airline that they didn't check for fuel when waited for 2-3 hours, its like keeping the life of customer at risk. When I reached Mumbai Airport, I didn't got my baggage there and airline employee informed me that my baggage is at Beijing airport, they forgot to transfer my bag to the connecting flight. I got my bags after 4 days at my home with items missing from my bag. Air China's customer service is very bad and they take no responsibility for their customer's safety and product security. I have contacted them several time but got no proper response, it is very irresponsible behavior.  Air China is taking no responsibility to help me find my items or compensate me for the loss. Even during flight when I asked for water, they told me they are out of disposal glass which is very bad on part of service the airline is providing. Worst service for safety and security.",,,,,
"  Copenhagen to Beijing via Stockholm. Premium economy ticket purchased through agent which means that you cannot use Air China website to check in, manage booking etc beforehand so we were assigned seats at check in. Air China website has very limited info on what you get for Premium economy - more legroom but nothing else. The first leg was with SAS plus which provided all the details so we were able to take advantage of priority queues and lounge access at Copenhagen which was excellent. When we transferred at Stockholm we were not permitted access to Air China lounge or any extra services. Food on plane was standard and not very appetizing. We had an additional Air China flight Beijing - Hong Kong which was delayed due to weather with no information from AC on reasons why. Return flight HGK-PEK-CPH was ok but nothing to get excited about. Cabin crew did a professional job. In flight media was hopeless. It is controlled from remote fixed into arm rest and is very small in size and buttons are difficult to access. It was very difficult to select items and i often hit call attendant by mistake. Most programmes catered for Chinese passengers with limited up to date western movies or music Overall, despite cheaper prices than competitors I don't think Premium economy is worth the extra. By contrast i wish we had flown SAS Premium economy the whole way.",,,,,
  Shanghai to Jakarta via Beijing. This is the worst flight ever!  I have a bad stop over condition with 1.5hrs time ti change the flight from domestic flight to international flight. It is a combination of huge airport; not clear signage; short time to change the plane and so tight security checking made me arrive in the gate 10 mins prior to departing. Which i didnt found any ground officer; there was one lady inside the isle and notice with my appearance but apparently she didnt open the glass gate for me. I contacted one of friend who were able to enter the plane in order to inform the staff to let me in without any result. The process to get to international counter wasnt easy as well. I have to ask several times till finally arrived to the counter which located in domestic terminal. No solution given and the lady was insisted of saying the airlines was able to replace my ticket with same same route for another two days because Air China doesnt have daily flight to Jakarta. It was suck!! Since air china wasnt able to compensate me with the accomodation since i have to stay for another two days; cant refund my ticket; cant give me rerouting ticket; cant give me another ticket from its affiliates and i have to book another ticket myself if i want to catch up the earliest flight to my country. The staff also didnt communicate well because apparently my baggage was being taken out from the plane. Later i found out from my friend that the flight got delayed for more than one hour for the sake of taking out my luggage. Still dont understand why Air China sells ticket with short time for stopover if the condition is not supported. Later I read in Beijing capital terminal mentioned that at min should have 2 hours stop over to process with all those checkins and moving from one to other terminals. ,,,,,
"  Budapest to Tokyo via Beijing. Worst service ever. We were 4 hours late to Tokyo and we arrived at midnight, when there are no mass transportation. We had to take a night taxi for a lot of extra charge in order to get to our hotels. The stewardesses are not friendly either except if you're Chinese. And on top of that, our luggage got lost on our way home. I do NOT recommend this airline to anyone. Just save up more money and travel with a better one.",,,,,
"  Air China is not bad compared to some airlines. I enjoyed my flights from JFK to CSX recently. The Boeing 777-300 is configured with a reasonable 3-3-3 with an IFE screen: it does not have a USB charger and no Wifi as well. FAs are well-trained and charming, while speaking English with some accents. The food is not bad and is in reasonable portion. The FA keeps me informed with the arrival gates and my connections. My luggage, though, missed connection but was delivered to me the same day.",,,,,
"  Manila to Stockholm via Beijing. I give Air China last chance but now after 2 travel included 8 flights I do not recommend them for no one. First they have way too cold temperature aboard, i told crew several times but it not help. On our long flight Beijing to Stockholm 9 hour we was many aboard freezing so much so we be sick. This is only one of many issues. Last flight was late so we miss next connecting flight and no direct reason why it was late? Crew not look after passenger in this flight CA911 and we was many was without drinks and coffee, with one word disaster. Crew also look tired and i think they have bad work situation in this airline. Air China have a long way to go, very long way. The first thing they must learn customer service and how to treat people overall, this is both on flight and also on Beijing  airport. I can go on and on but this is enough for now.",,,,,
  The journey started with very friendly ground staff at Frankfurt Airport. Both legs were smooth and pleasant flights. The seats are ok. For long distance flights they have been a bit hard for me which was uncomfortable during the last two hours of the first leg. The IFE offered a nice selection of Chinese and international movies and series. Compared to other airlines it was a smaller selections but enough for an entertaining flight in multiple languages. The cabin crew was nice and never acted bothered or unfriendly. They had an open ear for the passengers. The only little thing that has been noticed is the English language of the crew. It was challenging to understand them due a very strong accent. The crew did their best but for unexperienced speakers it would be tough to understand. The food on both flights has been good for economy. Both warm food options and the snack was very tasteful. The connection at Beijing airport was fast and as comfortable as possible. After security the waiting area for transit passengers offered a good view of the gates and lots of vending machines and snack and coffeshop. Air China positively surprised me with their good service for cheap price. ,,,,,
"  London to Phuket via Chengdu. Awful. If you can, book with someone else. All the flights were late, the food is horrible and it did not change in the entire flight (rice and chicken 24/7). But the main thing for me was that on my return, I got the dates wrong and i turned up a day late to my flight. This wad entirely my fault, but no one in the company could offer me a solution and they made me call their call centre in china, where they put me on hold for more than 20min (international call-imagine the cost). The staff was really rude, picked up the phone and said they would not put me in another flight (even though the woman at the check in desk told me there was a lot of space in the next one) and they wanted to charge me around 1000€. In the end I had to book another one with Singapore Airlines, faster and only 550€. Even though it was my fault to miss it, i know this happened to a few people and their company placed them on the next flight free of charge or for a fee. ",,,,,
"  Beijing to Washington. Food has improved over the last flight about a year ago. Last time I won’t even eat the food it was so terrible. Aircraft had all the bells and whistles to include an IPhone charging outlets. The toilets were extremely dirty. Most of the flight attendants were extremely rude, conversely, others were extremely polite. My final comment is that even though Air China does not have control over the this, airport security operations in the dark ages! Of all the airports I’ve been to, this is absolutely the worst security operations there is.",,,,,
"  Los Angeles to Hangzhou via Beijing. Worst travel experience in my life. I was traveling with ac from Los Angeles via Beijing to Hangzhou on April 2nd. The plain landed 15 min late which was not so bad considering the flight was 13 hours long. I missed my connecting flight to Hanghzou due to tight flight connections, disorganization of the Air line and the customs and crew. We never got the entry card on the plane, so 200 people were trying to get the card, find a pen and the space where to fill out the card. At the same time airport staff barely speak English, but they are great in ""sign"" language. Anything you ask they just use their hands to direct you to go left, right, back or straight. Truly sad. I was directed along with a another passenger to the wrong gate c10 , instead of c4 that directly led to miss my flight literally within 5 min. I needed to go back to the main terminal and change my ticket. I was issued a ticket for next morning and offered hotel stay. When I got to the dingy hotel I was told if I dont want to share the room with another person I will have to pay 200 yuan.  Yes, I end up paying for the hotel! On my way back from Hangzhou to Beijing my flight was delayed 1 hour and 30 min because of ""air traffic control"". We landed at 2:10. I was running, thru the airport, from domestic to international department, and despite my own belief I managed to get to the gate Lady told me that my ticked was erased and she can not do anything. I needed to go back to change my ticket for the next flight which was 6 hours later, and even this flight was delayed for another 90 min, due to Again ""air traffic control"" . Thank you For making my trip so miserable. I will make sure to spread the word everywhere I go to let everyone how bad the experience was, and aware travelers to stay away from this airline company.",,,,,
  Frankfurt to Bangkok via Beijing. We missed our last flight (Bangkok to Phuket) because the flight from Beijing to Bangkok departed 2.5 hours late. We should have arrived at 18.35 but we arrived at 21.00. We didn’t get refund for the flight we missed and the hotel although it wasn’t our fault.,,,,,
" Taipei to Beijing. Surprisingly the food tasted great. Had some nice food in the lounge in TPE as well. Onboard, the service was good, an angled flat biz class seat. But for a 2-3 hours flight, it was sufficient.",,,,,
" I took biz class flight from Beijing to Taipei. The overall service was good, but I ordered a fruit platter and that was a very basic one, the presentation was not good and the fruit quality was not either. But the crew was  attentive and pleasant, I hope Air China can improve the food as there is only so much a crew member can do to make up the overall customer experience. Air China’s aircraft and seatings in biz class are on the par with some airlines.",,,,,
"  Auckland to Delhi via Beijing. The flight took off and landed smoothly. Food was average but okay, plenty of drink. Entertainment touch screen is easy to use. Crew was very helpful and lovely, the price is very competitive, plus you can transit in Beijing without visa. A great airline. Will definitely fly again with Air China.",,,,,
"  Hangzhou to Johannesburg via Shenzhen. I had the worst experience ever using this flight Air China.I had extra kgs of my luggage which I was suppose to pay for. They told me to pay the amount which was double the actual money that I was suppose to pay. These guys they don't understand at all. I spend about 2 hours talking with them that this amount is too much, you might be doing a mistake. I ended up left my suitcase because I did not have that huge amount they wanted me to pay. When I was now in Shenzhen I asked the other Air China staff the amount I should pay for much kgs and they told me the correct amount but it was now too late because I had left the suitcase in Hangzhou airport. I am very disappointed with this airline and I will never took it again. Now my suitcase is still in China and I am going to incur extra expense to ship it to my country. Also they do not give enough food as compared to other airlines. Air China just give two meals for the whole journey from Shenzhen to Johannesburg. I don't advise anyone to use this airline.",,,,,
" Took 4 flights recently on a return trip to Japan. Booked 10 months advanced and requested vegetarian food. First on two flights they had no record of our request. I ended up eating 3 bread rolls as they had nothing else. On the 3rd flight coming home, they somehow had remembered and provided a veggie meal (which was the same as the normal meal, but no meat. Just plain rice!). By this point I had given up hope. Low and behold, the 4th flight was no vegetarian food. How they can let this happen is beyond me, not because of me being a vegetarian, but what happens to those with nut allergies or something? Also, the aircraft's were awful. The final leg home from Beijing to London, we were ferried out into the middle of Beijing airfield, where a lone aeroplane stood, looking very dirty and unused. This plane was from around 1999, with old TV sets, practically no leg room, and uncomfortable seats. Hands down the hardest flight I've had to endure. Will pay more next time and fly with a company like Singapore.",,,,,
"  I took a business class trip from Beijing to London, and the service was not as good as previous trips. The crew greeted me in a pleasant manner, and presented me with welcome drinks etc. However, when one female crew member took my dinner order, she forgot to ask for drink choices, and it also applied to the person next to me. None of us had any drinks with our meal and it was in biz class. My pre-booked special meal did not turn up until I asked either. Their procedure was to check with special meal requests then serve, but this was not done correctly. My friend asked me to complain onboard, I didn’t think that particular member of staff was worth of complaining. It’s the natural ability to serve and to do a good job that she is lacking. Other than that the flight in biz class was comfortable enough, the drinks were plenty.",,,,,
"  London Heathrow to Beijing in December. The experience was good in business class, apart from the food. As this was a full flight I expected a rushed service but it was not and most of the staff were lovely. The personal storage on business class seat is very limited I had to put everything to my right, into an open hole storage, which is located below the seat cushion level. No surprise, I forgot to take it back from the storage after landing, and the chief purser came out of the aircraft and walked down the staircases to the tarmac and stopped the shuttle bus to return it to me. That was in a minus temperature. I was touched that the crew managed to clear the areas of business class after all pax disembarked and found my items and the purser came down to return it to me. I appreciated what they did for me.",,,,,
"  We were expected to travel from London and Paris to Calvi, all booked together on family holidays. Air Corsica suspended all flights from London giving only two weeks’ notice and did not accept to refund tickets from the third passenger travelling from Paris. The third passenger could not travel alone, and we also had to cancel accommodation and car rental resulting in additional costs incurred. Extremely poor customer service, many emails and phone calls since September. Lots of time and money lost and extremely high frustration.",,,,,
"  You can change your seats at e-check in without charge. Both flights were on time. A320neo was clean, there were no inflight service for the 1 hour flight. Stewards were efficient and friendly enough.",,,,,
"  Bastia to Stansted. Group of 8 flying as a family. At check-in, Air Corsica staff mixed up baggage tags so they did not correspond to the correct individual. Air Corsica then decided not to load a full trolley of luggage on to the flight to ensure it was not delayed. 4 out of 8 bags did not arrive at Stansted within our family (alongside numerous other families that were also missing bags). We proceeded to inform staff but as the luggage tags were on incorrect bags due to incompetent staff, we could not make it as clear as it should have been on the missing bag forms. 3 out of 4 bags arrived within 5 working days. Our bag has never been recovered. Air Corsica have then proceeded to make it impossible to track it down or receive a refund for lost luggage. Website does not allow you to save or upload correct information so 4 times we had to restart our request. They refuse to speak English on the phone. After we finally processed the refund request, they sent one reply saying the bag had been returned and therefore the case was closed. They then closed the request without even contacting us and so we therefore had no way of appealing this. The bag has never returned. We have now had to go through our insurance provider but even this is being made difficult as they aren't even able to get hold of Air Corsica and as our luggage tags were incorrect we are having to speak to multiple insurance providers that we took insurance out with even though it only affected one of us.  We flew in September 2019, are now in February 2020 and are still trying to receive compensation for our luggage. ",,,,,
"  Stansted to Ajaccio. Excellent all round. On time, drink and a snack served, no hassle to board or have onboard bags. Seats were comfy for a 2 hour flight - fare reasonable. Would recommend.",,,,,
"  I flew from Marseille to Ajaccio. Overall I was satisfied. The outbound leg was carried out with an ageing but very well kept ATR 72, and the return with a recent A320. Both flights were on time and the crew was polite and smiling. Given the short duration of the flights, both around 50 minutes, the inflight service consisted solely of drinks, but that's fine. The basic fare always includes a checked in luggage and the price was correct: I spent 118 euros return to fly on mid-July booking just 4 weeks prior to departure. The only minus was the long waiting time to collect the luggage at AJA (25 minutes despite having just 2 aircrafts to unload), but I don't blame it on Air Corsica.",,,,,
"  Flight XK101 on December 25th. Like every year going back home, there were long queues at the check-in counters due to understaffed service on Christmas Day, which caused a 30 minute boarding delay for just a 40 minute flight. Aircraft was as tight as usual. 100% full. Don't expect much from this flight which is just a hop across the Med. Onboard crew is OK, but ground staff are slow. Propeller aircrafts are very noisy. Service onboard is 1 drink. But, most of all is how can the airline justify such a high price 190 Euros (non flexible tickets) round trip for only 2x 40min flights. Prices are more expensive than ever despite the very low cost of fuel. ",,,,,
"On September 4th 2015, we had reservations to fly Air Corsica from Calvi to Nice. Then we had connection on Alitalia to Rome. Our connections were very tight with only 45 minutes in Nice. Weather on September 4 created much confusion. The Air Corsica flight from Nice to Calvi was delayed 1 hour and arrived at 10:45am. We were going to miss our Nice to Rome connection. We expected to be staying the night in Nice. We departed Calvi 1/2 hr late. Fortunately, the flight from Nice to Rome was also delayed. The Air Corsica agents in Calvi arranged for an agent in Nice to assist in having my wife and I meet Alitalia agent. That agent escorted us through security to our gate and we made the Nice/Rome connection. We arrived in Rome only 1/2 hour late and all of our bags (4) arrived perfectly.",,,,,
Short hop from Nice to Calvi. Hardly any people onboard. Crew were not particularly friendly or welcoming but we were served a cookie and soft drinks. Landed smoothy although slightly delayed due to a missed approach. However tickets were cheap and luggage included. All in all a decent experience.,,,,,
A good trip. I did Paris-Orly-Calvi and Calvi-Marseille. These trips were fairly good staff at the airport and cabin crew where very good. Biscuits and a drink served onboard (totally normal for the time of the flight which is not longer than one hour and a half). However the seat was really small.,,,,,
"Paris Orly. Full fare ticket in Economy class on both sectors as no other airlines fly this route due to the ""public service"" law requirement. It is 100% affiliate with Air France and same basic service on their flights : a drink with some savoury biscuits. Nice-Ajaccio small regional aircraft very old and extremely noisy. Cabin crew average. Served one glass of water and nothing else. Ajaccio-Paris Orly a glass of apple juice with some savoury biscuits in a typical A320. Staff at the airport extremely helpful but crew quite average hardly noticing you. For this price the service is below standards and would consider the ferry boat !",,,,,
"Bangalore to Hyderabad. My first time with Air Costa – they been operating as a regional airline India for 2 years. A great experience, the legroom was really good, seats comfortable and the aircraft very new. It's low cost, so besides a glass of water, it costs. But given the flight time of little over an hour that's no problem. The range of food and beverages looked good though. The flight was 20 mins late – the only downside.",,,,,
"  A dreadful experience all the way. Started at Conakry airport where I was told the time of the flight had been changed for 2 weeks but no notice where sent to passengers even business class even if it is possibly the most expensive ticket I have ever bought related to the number of miles flown. So 4 hours of unnecessary wait. The seat was nothing better than adequate and the cabin crew did not care about me even if I was the only passenger in Business class, easy to understand why! No meal offered on a more than 2 hours flight, only luke warm ordinary champagne served in the kind of soft plastic ""glasses"" you find in office water fountains. Horrendous experience when I connected in Abidjan: all passengers had to walk several hundred yards on the tarmac in the middle of vehicles and planes, with no staff to assist, even on a security standpoint. On the second leg, zero service, zero meal, zero drink. Horrible experience.",,,,,
" Boarding was by bus, departure on time. Plane was in a good condition. There was a limited IFE through your mobile, adequate for such a hour flight. Inflight service was a bottle of water. There was buy MENU available.",,,,,
"  Hargeisa to Djibouti. Air Djibouti operates one single Boeing 737-500, leased with crew from a company in Tajikistan, as well as, reportedly, a few smaller aircraft. We flew from Hargeisa to Djibouti in November. The plane had arrived from Mogadishu with a delay but landed in JIB almost on time. It was definitely at least 25 years old but appeared to be in a very good state of repair. Seats were tight but comfortable. Catering consisted of a single bottle of water, which was ok on this 40-min hop. Okay was also our general impression.",,,,,
 The worst experience ever! Flight Florence-Frankfurt was canceled half an hour before departure! We were already on the gate. Had to go back and wait 5 hours at the airport until the airline rerouted the flight. They decided to fly us from Verona. We waited hours for the bus then they book us a cheap ugly dirty hotel where they put us in the rooms a bag with disgusting sandwiches. They didn’t arrange for our transfer from hotel to airport next day. We had to pay for the taxi! Never again with this airline!,,,,,
" Flight EN8287 on 02 June from Milan to Munich was delayed. Instead of leaving at the scheduled time (4:40 p.m.), it was delayed until 6:35 p.m. I arrived in Munich at 19.40 until all the passengers disembarked, it was 19.50 and I didn't catch the next flight home from Munich to Timisoara which was at 20.10. I asked the flight attendant to inform Lufthansa that we are late and to ask them to wait for me. Then I asked her to let me go out through the back door so that I don't have to wait until all the passengers get off, or to find a solution to help me. This lady from Air Dolomiti did not want to help me. In the end I arrived at 20.10 but the gates were already closed so I had to stay one night in Munich and take another flight the next day. I had an unpleasant experience with this company and I do not recommend it to anyone. ",,,,,
"  I flew with Air Dolomiti twice in May (even though I was initially supposed to fly with Lufthansa, but they changed us to Air Dolomiti). Both flights were late (the first one was 3 hours late and made us miss our connecting flight to the USA). The second flight (from Frankfurt to Trieste) was one hour late. On the second flight, they made my mother have her case under her feet because there was ""no space"" in the overhead cabins, while they let people keep their backpacks and jackets there. ",,,,,
"  No organization of passengers or boarding process. The staff loaded 80 passengers onto 2 busses (without any organization for seat/boarding positions which will be a problem later) kept 80 passengers in 2 hot busses for 30+ minutes without A/C turned on (only a couple windows cracked on the doors that weren't broken) and no explanation about the delayed flight or why we weren't being transported to the airplane. After 35 min I stepped off the bus to ask why the delay (as we had a tight connection in Munich if we didn't leave soon)m in rude fashion 3 different men in AD vests told me to get back on the bus. I refused until some explanation about delay, they said there was some issue with the other bus but we would all leave in 2 minutes. So I got back on the bus and they scurried around and we left about 5 min later and they drive both busses no farther than 20 yards to the waiting plane. All the passengers pile into the airplane without any regard for seating priority or placement, but after 30 minutes we all had our seats and then we waited more and taxied. Plane left 30 minutes late and we almost missed our connection. We asked the flight attendant for info about gate arrival and she shrugged and said...we have external gate and a bus will drop you off at Gate L, shrugs and ""you'll have to hurry to catch your connection "".",,,,,
"  The first for me that a plane arrives from the previous flight really on time and we go out late, arrived a little late but the nice stewards compensate all these not so good things. In all a good experience.",,,,,
"  In favour of the staff onboard; the attitude was extremely friendly, we got a biscuit together with some water, and the cabin looked clean and crisp. What one can get on low cost airlines doesn’t justify flying with many European full service airlines and that includes Air Dolomiti. The reason I took them was only the time schedule, certainly not for flying premium, as the experience was nothing else than the opposite.",,,,,
"  I booked with Lufthansa and the Frankfurt/Pisa sector was operated by air Dolomiti. Both in Frankfurt and Pisa we were bused to the aircraft. In Fra it felt like we were driving to Pisa. Awful airport. Once on board there was nowhere to store my carry on bag and coat as the lockers in business class were full. Odd as there were only 3 passengers in business. There was someone in my seat when I boarded but I was happy enough to move as he did acually have seat 1B on his boarding card too although he was on an economy ticket, The purser sorted it fast. Seats are small and hard but its generally shortish flights so it's ok. Both of my air Dolomiti flights were breakfast flights and I found the standard of catering to be better than most. It was nicely served and of good quality. I was quite impressed on a short flight. Crew were lovely and attentive on both sectors. Be warned though if you are flying business with Lufthansa out of Frankfurt on the Fra Pisa sector you will not be able to access the business lounge as the air Dolomiti gates to Pisa are in the Schengen area and the lounges are through passport control. Its unfortunate that I had to travel through Frankfurt Main which I think is an overpriced filthy dump. My cases were lost on the way home and didn't turn up for 5 days. Most of the unpleasant parts had very little to do with air Dolomiti. Once on board I found the crew to be lovely and the catering to be far better than most airlines. I'd definitely fly with them again.",,,,,
"  The very short flight was decent. The aircraft clean. When embarking there was a female member of the aircrew welcoming passengers on board - with a simple buon giorno and a smile. When embarking she greeted the passenger in front of me, and behind me - and ignored me. The other male crew members who were offering water and a biscuit and were collecting the rubbish were very courteous. When disembarking this same female member of the aircrew was stood at the exit and greeting passengers as they left. One more she greeted the passengers in front me and behind me and did not greet me. I believe that I am entitled to the same standard of treatment as the other passengers. I do not know the motivations for this particular member of the air crew’s omission towards me - however I do think they fall beneath the standards of her training and basic common courtesy.",,,,,
"  The flight Munich to Brussels booked on Lufthansa was flown by Air Dolomiti . The boarding was extremely unpleasant - we had to go down I think on stairs around 45 steps and put put in a bus - the plane was very far from the terminal building - when the bus arrived at the plane another waiting time. When the plane was finally ready, the pilot did announce a small technical problem so back and repair took around 1 hour and a quarter - a very small drink was offered in a very small glass during waiting time despite FA were friendly the service in business was a disaster - I think the snack can compete for the smallest meal ever in business - 25g of cheese a small piece of pineapple and 2 grapes, no breads  and a very minuscule glass of white wine no refill offered.",,,,,
"  Air Dolomiti's customer service and handling lost baggage reports is disgraceful and is a display of the ultimate incompetence of one airline to it's customers belongings. On a long business trip after a flight from Frankfurt to Verona the bag is missing for almost two weeks, Air Dolomiti is putting not even a minor effort to find it or at least reply all the emails. All you can get from Air Dolomiti, after following their lost and found procedures from their website and submitting all their claim forms, baggage content forms and costs reimbursement forms, is a generic email reply. Which gives you no updates, no reimbursement confirmation, no deadlines, no phone number to call. They just don't want to bother. Very frustrating for any traveller as their customers.",,,,,
"  Avoid especially if booking United Airlines and they code share. My UA app shows my bags being scanned at 11.35 am. My Air Dolomiti flight was delayed boarding so there was plenty of time to move mine and my girlfriends bag for our flight to Florence. They didn’t make it. There was another later flight that arrived about 7.30 pm. Then the next day as well. It is 7.10 pm (27 hours later) and still no bags. My hotel is 1 hr away. The paper the airport lost and found gave me only has an automated system that says “Your bags have been found”. Found where? The guy I spoke to twice today was nice and somewhat helpful and said my 2 bags were picked up by a courier mid morning. Why not at 8 am when the office opens? I ask because after calling United Airlines, they told me our bags came in on last nights flight. ",,,,,
"  The reviews prior to booking were a concern due to the reported delays/cancellations without notice, so I booked an early AM flight from Florence to connect with a midnight international flight from Frankfurt, to give time for things to go wrong. The end result was 12 hours in Frankfurt waiting for my connection as the Air Dolomiti flight departed and arrived within 10 minutes of the published schedule. Check-in staff were friendly and efficient and the cabin crew had a relaxed and efficient manner with the passengers. Meal, snacks, drinks were offered but declined for a short flight. An enjoyable flight with Air Dolomiti",,,,,
" It used to be a wonderful airline and a true Italian alternative to what the market had to offer. It still has its charm, but clearly Lufthansa as owner has downgraded whatever they could. Now they have the non-existent Lufthansa service, far from anything of a five or four star airline. Purchased this flight as LH ticket and though I was happy to fly Air Dolomiti because of their new planes and always kind crew, I am sorry to see how things are going terribly down: delay, no communication, pathetic little biscuit (which clearly is an embarrassment also to the crew) and a mini bottle of water. Very good is one can access an entertainment system through wifi onboard, not a usual feature on an European regional airline.",,,,,
"  Our entire Air Dolomiti experience has been horrible since the moment we showed up to the Florence airport. During check in, we were told that we may not get on the flight. They reserve 15 people from every flight out of Florence that may or may not make it on. Our group of 15 was forced to wait by the check in counter (couldn’t go through security) for hours. The flight kept getting pushed back and back while the front desk agent basically just ignored us. Seemed annoyed when we asked for more info about whether we would make it or not. Finally after 3+ hours of waiting, my boyfriend and I were allowed on the flight (not every passenger was. People who weren’t were crying because in the time they made us wait, they missed out on all of their other options to make it to Munich that day). We check our bags, wait another half hour or so for a bus to take us to our plane where those people who boarded had been waiting for who knows how long. Then finally, when we land, we wait at the carousel for our luggage (which would be a carry on with any American airline). We wait for over an hour in Munich for bags going back and fourth to the Lufthansa help deal to try to get any info at all because Air Dolomiti will not speak with customers. After being told 3 times or so that our bags had made it and we were just waiting, we were finally told that our bags never left Florence. We filed a report with Lufthansa. And it has been two days now and I have yet to hear a word from Lufthansa or Air Dolomiti about our bags. And it wasn’t just two peoples bags. It was 15+. Everyone without a connection did not have their bags. They have no method of tracking bags, no reasonable access to customer service representatives. And from what I can tell, their employees care SO LITTLE, I wouldn’t be shocked if we never see our bags again. We leave Munich in a few days so fingers crossed that will not be the case. But I’m not holding my breath. Air Dolomiti could offer me a completely free flight and I still would not take it. They are that bad and disorganized as soon as the slightest issue arises.",,,,,
"  Terrible airline. Terrible experience. Pilot showed up late past the time for boarding start time. Then they have no one to load luggage so we sat on the tarmac in a full plane for an hour. This airline ruined our plans with others, ruined our next connection and destroyed a day of vacation. Terrible mismanagement and incompetence. I’ll never fly with them again.",,,,,
" LH2371 from ZRH to MUC operated by Air Dolomiti. The flight had a delay of 80 minutes, which led to some passengers missing their connections in Munich. The crew was very helpful however, providing the passengers with up-to-date information about connecting flights. The flight itself was very uneventful. The crew was very professional, and passengers were given complimentary water bottles. Because the flight was full, economy passengers with multiple pieces of hand luggage had to check their additional items.",,,,,
"  They simply could not care less about customers. 4 people who had checked in early were denied seats because airline switched to a smaller aircraft. 4 suitcases lost and not delivered for 5 days. Zero chance to contact anybody and no communication at all from the airline. On return check in one counter for 150+ passengers. Upon asking why there are no more counters open it was suggested ""if you want to you can complain"". Return trip - luggage lost again. 80 mile delivery takes 3 days +",,,,,
"  Munich to Amsterdam. A shorthaul flight which is not much different than a regular Lufthansa flight. Level of cabin service is about the same but certainly good enough. Flight attendants were friendly and attentive. They've an inflight wifi system which offers games, newspapers etc. All in all, a great experience.",,,,,
" Frankfurt to Verona. The plane had very nice livery and very nice design inside. Air Dolomiti colors are very nice. There was very clean inside. After boarding cabin crew gave out refreshing towels in business and economy class. The crew was very friendly and helpful. Air Dolomiti has very nice in-flight service, you can choose between cold drinks, hot drinks, beer and very good wines served in real glasses in economy and business class. There are also some biscuits and sandwiches, but it depends on the flight. IFE was also very good for such a short journey, every passenger can connect their phones to Air Dolomiti WiFi - there are information about the current aircraft position and some videos about Italy. Every travel with Air Dolomiti is travel in Italian Style. I highly recommend!",,,,,
"  Catania to Munich. Overall a great flight experience. The cabin crew is very attentive and the plane equipped with an excellent entertainment system that can be used with the on-board wifi on your smartphone, all included in the ticket price. Pleasant flight and great meal. ",,,,,
"  Munich to Bologna and Pisa to Munich, both on an Embraer 195, economy. Both flights handled efficiently; southbound on time, northbound delayed by about 25 mins on departure due to to late arrival of incoming flight (there had been thick fog at MUC early that morning which had sent things adrift for much of the morning). However, support given to those with tight connections. Modest in-flight service - snacks and drinks - wine came in proper glasses. Other reviewers seem to have had a hard time, but Air Dolomiti worked OK for us.",,,,,
"  Munich to Pisa. Unorganized, incompetent company, huge disappointment. We were flying to Pisa for a vacation and first our flight got cancelled. We lost $150 on a hotel reservation. Then our rescheduled flight was one hour delayed because their crew hasn’t arrived. The company must be extremely mismanaged because as we were sitting in Munich we saw that other flights were also delayed for the same reason. And all this hassle after we paid $350 for the ticket. Huge disappointment!",,,,,
" Lufthansa flight from EWR to Munich was 10 minutes late, we were a group of 22 and we all raced panic stricken through the unfamiliar airport and customs to make this connecting flight (leaving at 11.15) only to be told at the gate (11.11) that the flight had already left! The Air Dolomiti employee began issuing new boarding passes for a 2.25 flight, but seemed overwhelmed when the rest of our group caught up and sent them all to customer service which is a long way back where they had just come from. A few people got lunch vouchers, most did not, why? At least we all were able to get tickets for next flight, which was delayed twice (why couldn't they have delayed our original flight? we were only minutes late) We finally took off at 4.00. The situation we found ourselves in was a scary one. Anyone who has had a connecting flight knows how stressful it is when one flight lands later than anticipated. It would have saved a dangerous run through the airport if a representative had met us or a message relayed over the loud speaker for all of us to go directly to customer service to be issued new boarding passes for a later flight! Not all of us are Olympic track stars!",,,,,
" Well I'd read reviews about this airline and thought no surely not but after a long stopover at Munich and with not long to boarding my flight was cancelled, no explanation. In the queue there were so many not singing the praises of this airline because they had had this before so instead of getting to my partner who I was meeting there for holiday and not being able due to ill health to stop for 36 hours for next flight Lufthansa flew me home. I would never again go anywhere if Air Dolomiti was choice of travel connection.",,,,,
"  Turin to Munich. Punctual, immaculate plane, comfortable seat, wine served in glasses also in economy. The staff is kind, offering more snacks on request, smiling. All great. Puntuale, aereo immacolato, sedile comodo, vino servito in bicchieri di vetro anche in economy. Lo staff è gentile, offre più snack a richiesta, sorridente. Tutto ottimo.",,,,,
"  
Lyon to Münich. Plane cabin was fairly new with enough legroom. Cabin staff was gentle and they offered possibility to get some snacks and drinks. Good service for short route. Only seat comfort can be enhanced.",,,,,
  Venice to Munich. Air Dolomiti charged my wife and I $224 US dollars for two bags that weighed under 50lbs each. I paid $100 from Dulles to Munch eight days ago. I was way overcharged but had no choice because I needed my bags to be returned to me in the USA. There fees for bags were not posted anywhere. ,,,,,
"  Worst check in staff. Rude. There were no lines so it wasn’t because I was keeping people from checking in that the staff were so short. Tried to link two Star Alliance tickets. My Husband did the same route two days before, separate tickets. No problem. As I checked my bag in they said it might not make it. Doesn’t make one feel the airline has it together. Alarming, and, sorry to say, lazy. At least I am connecting with Singapore Air. Solitaire member (Gold on Star Alliance). This review is solely based on the check in service.",,,,,
 Frankfurt to Florence. The aircraft could be a newish plane but it was so dirty and very grubby inside. The dirtiest plane I have ever been on. I don’t know who cleans them or the last time it was done. It’s a shame as that is the only problem I found with Air Dolomiti.,,,,,
  Munich to Sofia. I'm really impressed with the service. Cabin crew - friendly and responsive. The aircraft (Embraer 190) was clean and with good legroom. Food and beverages were of a higher quality then those of Lufhansa (although it is a subsidiary). Would definitely recommend this airline.,,,,,
"  Gothenburg to Munich. My flight was a Lufthansa flight operated by Air Dolomiti. I would say that Air Dolomiti makes a better job than the elder brother. The ground crew was helpful. Our flight delayed 35 minutes because of the weather conditions and we were informed by the cabin crew or by the pilot every 5 mins. They served a hand sanitizer napkin before the meal (I only experienced this on intercontinental flights) and the complementary meal service was the best I have ever got on a short haul flight (a tasty sandwich with chocolate cookies, coffee and orange juice and wine). As final before the landing we got a jelly candy. The seat comfort and the cabin temperature were great, the cleanless is very satisfying. The cabin crew was kind and helpful, they got to know my next gate number because of my connection and the delay before the landing and they showed me the gate on a map. The flight was smooth in spite of the horrible weather conditions. Nice job Air Dolomiti! The best domestic airline in Europe!",,,,,
"  
I am very unimpressed with Air Dolomiti. We were schedule to depart at 8.55 am but did not leave the air field until 9.43 am and we had an international connecting flight to Munich to connect to Los Angeles. There was never an update over the intercom as to why it was late and the only apology was towards the end of the flight and still no reason was given. Thank goodness we made the connecting flight. Anyone who has ever been to Munich airport will agree that it is not the easiest to navigate through. I will never fly Lufthansa again!",,,,,
"  Florence to Munich. For a short flight of about an hour, the onboard service was excellent, the seats pleasant and staff exceptionally friendly. There were also several beverages offered and this was a very pleasant flight in a relatively new aircraft. Air Dolomiti is a highly recommended airline.",,,,,
  Flew Air Dolomiti from Amsterdam to Munich. Good flight and on time. Crew looked tired and were not very friendly. Plane looked well maintained and clean. Seats very comfortable and good leg space. A small snack was served during the flight.,,,,,
"After a fraught day missing a flight from Paris CDG and being rerouted to Genoa via Munich we boarded a well presented Air Dolomiti aircraft only to hear a message from the Captain that there would be a 20 minute delay waiting for passengers from Amsterdam. After they eventually arrived he again came on the intercom to say that he realized we had a cruise liner to meet and he would expedite the flight - and he did flying it like a light aircraft to reduce a 90 minute flight to a 48 minute flight - congratulations to him! The cabin crew were 3 smartly dressed young ladies and the purser was almost in tears when she was the one to tell us that our luggage was not onboard. The snack was, rather strangely, a cellophane wrapped apple but they insisted on us having a second Prosecco ""to cheer us up"". Then when we landed they came to assist us with our baggage claim - service indeed!",,,,,
"Operated on behalf of Lufthansa, this Munich to Geneva route seems to get passed around LH's subsidiaries (I've flown with Augsburg Airways, Lufthansa Cityline and the parent company) but this was the best one I'd flown. Friendly, quadrilingual Air Dolomiti crew (even Swiss crews usually only manage 2-3 languages), nice snack box with and good alcoholic and soft drinks. The interior was very clean, seemed pretty new and I quite like the colour scheme. The seat pitch gave me enough space to work on my laptop, which I don't take as a given any more. All on time - I hope I get them next time I do this route.",,,,,
"Flights both to Venice and from Venice were fine, on time and relatively uncomplicated. However, it angered us that our carry-on bags, that were by Lufthansa standards (dimensions and weight), had to be checked on the return flight to Munich, yet fit perfectly on our flight from Munich to Venice two weeks earlier. If you have carry-on guidelines and people follow them, they should never be told that they must have to check them! A ""carry-on"" bag should be just that, one that you can bring on the plane.",,,,,
"One of the best airlines I have flown with. We flew from Riga to Frankfurt with Lufthansa, and then from Frankfurt to Verona with Air Dolomiti. The flight wasn't long, about 1hr 10 minutes. The flight attendants were friendly. I would recommend.",,,,,
"The flight was late but the service on board was prompt and affable. The food is particularly nice for a European regional carrier. The biggest problem was that, as in other cases before, the miles were not registered. Every time it takes a series of e-mails to get them registered to Miles and More or other rewards programs.",,,,,
"I was flying from TRN-MUC last August, the overall flight experience was good. I booked the flight through Lufthansa where Air Dolomiti is their carrier operating from Turin. The cabin crew were polite and helpful. The flight was on time, but the ground crew delayed it a few minutes with moving passengers from the aircraft to the terminal. I flew thrice in the same month on the same route where my overall satisfaction was good.",,,,,
LH1964 18 Aug operated by Air Dolomiti. Great service. We were offered very tasteful tramezzino. FA offered 2 or 3 drinks and tramezzino rounds.,,,,,
Flight LH9444 from Munich to Bergamo Orio al Serio. Seating 8C (economy class). The short trip was really good and inexpensive. On board the seating was comfortable and the legroom was perfect. Also service on board was good but one hostess was impolite (the only negative note).,,,,,
PSA-MUC in June 2014 in economy class. Flight left with +/- 25mins delay due to a medical emergency on board. Spacious cabin in this nice Embraer 195 aircraft. Refreshing towel for hands and face was offered before take-off and after take-off the meal service begun including a sandwich and drinks. Wine is offered in a real glass which is a bonus! Second time for me on this airline and truly to be recommended!,,,,,
MUC-FLR in February 2014 in economy flight was full. Plane was clean-although economy was pretty cramped flight staff was pleasant and professional. Air Dolomiti even gave us a snack and a drink on this short flight. Arrived on time. Would recommend (they are part of the Lufthansa network we thought we were booking a LH flight when we booked). Enjoyable experience.,,,,,
Flew on a charter from Gatwick to Verona on an Inghams holiday. The flights both ways were on time and 30 minutes shorter than quoted. The staff were welcoming professional and immaculate. The plane was an Embraer 195 and was spotless. Snacks only provided so no comments really well it was a charter. I would not hesitate to fly again with them.,,,,,
I'm a New Yorker living in Bergamo Italy. Flying to NYC via Malpensa is not convenient. So I looked forward to trying Lufthansa's route: Newark to Frankfurt (Lufthansa) connecting with their partner Air Dolomiti to Bergamo (Orio al Serio.) Monday August 26 at Newark/Lufthansa check-in I couldn't obtain a boarding pass for the Air Dolomiti flight. After much delay Lufthansa informed me that the flight had been cancelled. According to Lufthansa they were not informed by their own partner. Obviously I was also not informed. Another flight was not available for another 12 hours. This lead to a series of aggravating delays rescheduling mishaps lost (and found baggage) etc. Cancellations happen but why wasn't Lufthansa or the passengers informed by Air Dolomiti?,,,,,
I had a pleasantly smooth flight. Service was excellent plane spotless plenty of sparkling wine to keep me company during my flight from Turin to Munich - I wish they flew out of London as well as I would go out of my way to use this company.,,,,,
Venice to Munich en route to Toronto 26 October 2012. Arrived at Marco Polo at 5.30 am for 8.45 am flight. Smooth check-in with two young staff members assisting passengers. Our slightly overweight suitcases accepted without comment and no surcharge. Informed our flight was delayed 2 hours (which would have caused us to miss our Air Canada connection in Munich) but we were being put on the 7 am flight which was boarding shortly. Sent past the long line for security check as Priority passengers and loaded on the transporter minutes later. The ATR7 my first non-jet flight took off on time with a full load. Almost immediately we were served a tasty cake with cappuccino by a smiling attendant. Began descent into Munich 20 minutes ahead of the scheduled flight time. A comfortable plane excellent service friendly staff efficient processing.,,,,,
Flew from Pisa to Munich on an ATR 72. Never flew on that model before and was amazed. Nice aircraft. Service was ok and the flight arrived on time. Seating was ok. Little narrow but then again its only a regional airline. The whole operation had an Italian charm. All in all a nice small charismatic airline.,,,,,
Rome - Munich: The flight started 15 minutes late and we had a tight connection to Hamburg. Onboard we were greeted with friendly cabin crew handing out newspapers but unfortunately no English ones. The leg room was acceptable for 2 hour flight and seats were soft enough. We were given cheese sandwiches and drinks. In the end we did make it to our connection without being in hurry. All in all a good product from Lufthansa and will definitely recommend them.,,,,,
Flew Business FRA-BGY-FRA on the same day. Total cost of 180€ return. Service was excellent food was fresh and tasty (cheese ham and fruits on the outbound salmon on the inbound flight). Cabin crew was always smiling. Definitely recommended.,,,,,
BLQ-FRA in a nice and clean Embraer 195. Loved the interior colours. Good service onboard and very friendly. Tasty snack on this 100 minutes flight.,,,,,
Pisa-Munich on ATR72. Great experience. Cabin spotless and flight attendants were professional and friendly. Inflight service started with refreshing towel for hands and face. Then offered Italian wine (choices from menu and wine served in a glass) plus a sandwich. Wish they flew in the US.,,,,,
Frequently flown Frankfurt to Milan (Linate/Malpensa) or Munich to Milan (Malpensa). Airline is good and generally on schedule. But to my utter disappointment the snack on the return leg frequently is only non-vegetarian. Planes are usually small so one can expect a bumpy flight.,,,,,
MUC-PSA return on ATR72. Plane was small but comfortable. FA's were friendly. Was given a sandwich which surprisingly was actually edible. I've heard good things about this airline and now I know why.,,,,,
Flew Air Dolomiti from Munich to Milan. It was a pleasant flight. After being delayed in Toronto for over 3 hrs we originally missed our connection but Lufthansa within 15 mins of landing in Munich got us on the next flight out. It was a very nice flight - the seats were comfortable the cabin-crew staff very friendly and very surprisingly the food (sandwich) was delicious.,,,,,
TRS-MUC-TRS on AT7. Crew professional no more Settimocielo food box just an apple biscuit and hot/cold drinks. Return 1h 30mins delayed due to technical problems. Crew professional but fed up and tired due to evening delay. Salty nibbles and cold drinks offered. Generally not like it used to be.,,,,,
Munich - Rome as a part of our trip from London on a codeshare with Lufthansa The flight left on time and landed early. The cabin crew were really good and and friendly served a nice snack with drinks. Presentation of the plane and crew were spotless . Can recommend this airline.,,,,,
BLQ-MUC with ERJ195 very comfortable with huge leg room but cabin extremely dirty. Crew professional and friendly. Food consisted of just a small packed snack + beverages.,,,,,
FRA-VRN-MUC Embraer ERJ195 and ATR72. Clean and pleasant cabin with professional crew. Good snacks and beverages offered. Check-in screens were not working in Verona so we had to wait for a quite long time.,,,,,
"VRN to FRA return with ATR 72 and Embraer 195. The cabin crew was professional and kind legroom was excellent. Newspaper available onboard free. The catering was excellent considering the flight time (1:00 h): into the ""Settimocielo"" box there were a salty snack a sweet and a small cup of water. Hot and cold beverages (including wines) offered by the cabin crew.",,,,,
Flight from Genoa to Munich was very pleasant. Excellent snacks and an overall atmosphere of relaxation throughout the flight. Lots of legroom. Nice plane a little on the noisy side.,,,,,
Munich to Venice return with a very nice Embraer 195. Both flights on time snack was tasty and crew was professional. To be quite honest I was not expecting Air Dolomiti to be such a good regional airline.,,,,,
TRS-MUC-TRS on AT7. Crew pleasant kind helpful kept passengers informed. Pilot talked to passengers all the time. Meal small but inventive surprising. Stewardesses smile. It seems that EN keeps its good standard!,,,,,
MUC-FLR ATR72-500. I have heard rumours of how noisy this aircraft is but to my great surprise it was just a little louder than a jet and I was even seated just beside the engine. Quite acceptable noise level ins the cabin. Flight stewardesses did a terrific work while we were flying over the Alps.,,,,,
MUC-Pisa and FLR-MUC : what a disappointment! Half a glass of liquid to drink miniature packet of snacks awful and the only food served in either direction. The aircon wasn't plugged in whilst on the ground and even in the air was hardly noticeable. One of the worst flights I've had. Boarding and disembarkation a shambles. 15 minute wait in aircraft with no air for bus to terminal.,,,,,
MUC BLQ return in business. Exceeded expectations. My heart sank at MUC when I realised it was a turboprop flight and I was expecting a LCC experience. Instead I had a nice breakfast of cold meats and bread rolls on the way out. On the return leg they served a nice dessert but I am not a dessert person. Flights were slightly delayed both times but not significantly so. Check in at BLQ was very efficient and the Marconi lounge has its own security lane which makes the whole process more pleasant.,,,,,
MUC-VCE rtn business class. An excellent overall experience. Very good ground facilities in Munich. Impeccable onboard service performed by onle one very efficient and friendly stewardess. Very tasty and imaginative food concept.,,,,,
BLQ-MUC return economy class. Nice ground service in MUC newspaper and sweets. Boarding fast and punctual. Flight on time excellent service with quality snacks soft drinks and wine. Excellent legroom clean airplane nice staff. Best regional airline tried recommended!,,,,,
Recently I experienced my first flight with Air Dolomiti and first time on an Embraer from Frankfurt to Verona. The boarding was punctual. Embraer is a nice plane and I enjoyed the fact that the seats are 2 by 2 only. The service onboard very professional. It was a flawless flight.,,,,,
Economy class from Munich to Florence on ATR 72. Aircraft clean though quite loud when seated next to the engine. After reading reviews on this site I did expect a better service. The flight attendants were smiling and friendly however they did not serve me and my girlfriend with beverages I had to request this specifically and the cookies that were the only food served on this late afternoon flight and disapointing.,,,,,
Traveled in business class from VCE-MUC and I'm not sure there was any difference in the seats or service in the front but the food was simple and fantastic. Loved that I could have a cappuccino onboard. The crew was friendly and helpful and the all around experience very positive.,,,,,
FRA-TRN in economy. Air Dolomiti is one of the best regional airlines around. excellent legroom and service.,,,,,
MUC-FCO: Booked a flight on Air Condor from Munich to Rome for 20 persons. Air Condor cancelled our flight but automatically rebooked us on Air Dolomiti. The flight was on time good snacks and nice flight attendants. I especially liked the way they boarded and deplaned from both the front AND rear of the aircraft.,,,,,
MXP-MUC on a BAe 146 Y class. Good legroom excellent catering even on such a short flight. Flight attendants not smiling but doing their job. Overall a good experience followed by a smooth and easy transit in Munich.,,,,,
Munich to Venice. Originally booked on Condor who cancelled the flight and automatically rebooked me with Air Dolomiti. The flight attendants were professional and very nice. The plane was clean departed and arrived on time and the food/snack service better than any meal/snack I've ever had on a flight in the US.,,,,,
MUC-TRN. Air Dolomiti has own check in gate area in MUC with Italian flair (espresso etc). Bussing from gate to aircraft in MUC was quick. Hand baggage can be delivered to A/C hold if not checked in. ATR-42 (or 72?). Leather seats quite a lot of legroom. Small snack served on evening service choice of drinks. FA's english was good. On time arrival in TRN. If they flew regional jets flight time could be reduced against Turboprops. Inflight magazine was well presented. All in all a pleasant flight for a late evening.,,,,,
MUC-TRN; GOA-MUC. Flight attendant starts service by offering a refreshment towel followed by a snack. Complementary white wine even offered on the lunch hour service to TRN. Flight attendant from MUC-TRN always wearing a big bright smile that was genuine. You know it's a good airline when the staff believes in the product offered.,,,,,
"  Experienced pilots and TCP,s, good legroom, tasty meals, relatively low costs for its price and comfortable seats. This airline has it all. If you are going to book a flight, first check that it is in Air Europa, because I recommend flying with them more than once in a lifetime.",,,,,
"  I booked return flights for a friend and myself with these people. It wasn’t until after my booking was completed and paid for that the confirmation email informed me that my flights would not be with them, but would be with Canary Fly. I checked the Canary Fly website and costed up the flights with them - Air Europa had charged me double the flight cost I would have paid if I had booked direct with Canary Fly! If I was told in advance of completing the purchase the flight would be with another airline, I would obviously have check them for flight prices first! In addition, my Canarian Residents discount wasn’t applied to my tickets, and when I called to bring it to their attention, I was basically told “tough, we can’t do it now”. So as well as paying 100% more through them, I also paid 75% more than I should have with residents discount. Avoid this company like the plague.",,,,,
"  The most incompetent airline you could fly with. They lost my luggage in the hold and two stopover flights when I returned to my country were delayed to the point that I lost the third. My vacation thanks to them was a nightmare, because I lost a lot of things thanks to their ineptitude, in addition to buying clothes, hygiene items, among other things. I lost count of the times I called to find out about the whereabouts of my suitcase. I even had to wait more than three months for them to pay me what was lost. The icing on the cake was that what they gave me covers only half of the total value of what my suitcase had. I advise you that although their prices are tempting, do not travel with this airline.  La aerolínea más incompetente con la que podrías viajar. Perdieron mi equipaje en bodega y dos vuelos de escala al retornar a mi país se atrasaron al punto de que yo perdiera el tercero. Mis vacaciones gracias a ellos fue una pesadilla, por que perdí un montón de cosas gracias a su ineptitud, además de comprar ropa, enceres de higiene entre otras cosas. Perdí la cuenta de las veces que llamé para saber sobre el paradero de mi maleta. Incluso tuve que esperar más de tres meses para que me remuneren lo que se perdió. La guinda del pastel fué que lo que me dieron cubre sólo la mitad del valor total de lo que mi maleta llevaba. Les aconcejo qué aunque sus precios sean tentadores no viajen con ésta aerolínea. ",,,,,
" What a hectic flight - late already and while starting to roll the pilot says that we have a engine problem and must return to the stand 30 minutes in the plane stranded and we told to leave because of tests to the plane 45 minutes in the gate and they change the gate and don’t say a thing and boarding as fast as we could and no control. No food, no nothing, just board and up we go. Very bad organization.",,,,,
" Flight in time, plane arrived sooner then expected, boarding was fast, flight attendants even as it was a not full flight told people before take off that could use vacant rows. Was a good flight experience.",,,,,
" Very busy flight, but arrived according to schedule. Food and drinks available to buy. Seat was ok. Infotainment system worked but no ear-phones were provided so it was like silent films. All in all it was good but not great.",,,,,
"  Avoid this airline. Do not fly with Air Europa if you have a connecting flight. They give you one hour to board the next flight but in reality, once you get off your first flight, you only have 35 minutes remaining. Then you have to run as fast as you could to the next terminal and pass through passport control which has massive queue. My husband who is EU national (he used the privileged gate for EU national), arrived quicker at the boarding gate and asked the 3 staffs in the gate to wait for me, (if ever I will be running late) due to the long queue in the passport control. They all refused as if it was our choice to come from the other end of the airport. Good thing we are young, with minimal luggages so we were able to arrive on time but I was really exhausted from running. If you're old, or have a family, children or not used to running, consider your plane ticket obsolete. The staff at the gate have zero empathy and they seem to have no idea that some of their passengers are coming from an Air Europa connecting flight because they just don't care about you at all. If they cannot accommodate their own passengers coming from a connecting flight, why would they sell this flight in the first place? Some of you might say that I could've joined my husband in the EU national passport control queue to arrive faster, my husband asked the staff in Madrid airport if I can join him, they refused and said that if he wants to join me, he should queue at the ""all passport""",,,,,
"  They are simply awful. Flight took off late by 30 minutes from MAD due to which it arrived little late at MUC, because of this I along with 7 other passengers missed our connection to AUH, Etihad airways did not wanted to help as the problem was caused due to in bound late arrival and when we had to go to Air Europa counter(in a different terminal) they said the flight was only delayed by 10 minutes, hence they are not responsible. No rebooking done, no compensation provided and we were left stranded at MUC airport.",,,,,
"  I am a person who travels frequently and with many airlines but the experience I had yesterday with air europe was quite unpleasant, first the customer service is terrible, you could see in his face that he was annoyed when I made an order for something, The presentation of the food and the terrible quality, it seemed to me that I was in a prison because they put the bread on top of the food, the tray only contained a bread, pasta or chicken and a sweet that did not taste anything, I ordered a coke and they gave me half a glass, then I thought that they were not going to give a snack on a 9-hour flight, they did, but you had to pay for it, which I have never seen on long trips. I flew economy class but paid a price with a bag of almost $2000.  The way from Miami to Madrid was the same, first the flight left 2 1/2 late, not even an apology, they only gave a text message, the food was terrible and breakfast had to be paid for, the end is very little positive to be said about that airline. Yo soy una persona que viajo frecuente y con muchas aereolines pero la experiencia que tuve ayer con air europe fue bastante desagradable,primero la atencion al cliente es pesima ,se le podia ver en su rostro que le molestaba cuando le hacia el pedido de algo, la presentacion de la comida y la calidad terrible ,me parecia que estaba en una prision pues el pan lo ponian arriba de la comida ,la bandeja solo contenia un pan la pasta o el pollo y un dulce que no sabia nada ,pedi una coca cola y me dieron medio vaso ,despues pense que no iban a dar un snack en un vuelo de 9 horas ,si lo dieron pero habia que pagarlo cosa que nunca he visto en viajes largos. y es verdad vole en clase turista pero pague un precio con maleta de casi $2000. La ida de miami a madrid fue igual primero el vuelo salio 2 1/2 tarde ni una disculpa dieron solamente un mensaje de texto ,la comida pesima y el desayuno habia que pagarlo ,el fin es muy poco lo positivo que hay que decir de esa aereolinea",,,,,
"  My wife and I flew Business Class and this is our experience. We couldn’t check in online because Air Europa required a negative Covid test be provided. That requirement was dropped on flights to the USA over a year ago. Consequently, we were unable to check in online. At the airport we needed a wheelchair. We sat in an uncomfortable “holding area” for over an hour and didn’t reach the gate until fifteen minutes before boarding. Consequently, we didn’t have lounge access prior to our flight. Those who needed to pre-board (my wife) or with Priority Status (myself) were left standing in a hot jetway for fifteen minutes before boarding the aircraft because the in flight staff weren’t ready for us. We could have remained comfortably seated at the gate until the aircraft was ready. The Business Class menu offered “Selection of Appetizers of either Gazpacho or Light Potato Cream and Parsley Oil”. Neither was offered. The menu offered “Starters” but they were served on the same tray as the entrée, along with a choice of chips or nuts. For a six hour flight why was the meal service rushed? Why wasn’t it serve it as intended, in courses?  The main course was pasta and it was inedible. The ravioli was over-baked in flight and crusty. A sauce added some moisture but it was tasteless. The menu offered a “Cheeseboard” but it wasn’t served. The dessert on the menu was “Granny style chocolate cake”. It wasn’t cake at all. It was more like cheesecake or mousse which was overly sweet and tasteless. Air Europa provided us two Wifi passes. I followed the instructions provided on my phone and laptop but it only worked for messaging. When I called this to the attention of the flight attendant she tried to assist me but then she took my computer away from me and stowed it in the compartment of my seat, as if to dismiss me. Had I paid $30.00 for the plan I’d have been more than a bit upset. Why provide this perk if it upsets your customers because it doesn’t work? Speaking of flight attendants, one hadn’t been through the cabin over an an hour since our dinner trays were cleared. They seemed to hide in the galley, hoping the passengers would go to sleep so they didn’t have to deal with us. The good news is that we landed safely at JFK, but we were left sitting in the cabin for thirty more minutes because we had to be transported to the terminal by bus. A finishing touch to a terrible experience. This airline isn’t competitive with the services of other carriers, including many discount airlines. I understand Air Europa has been sold to Iberia Airlines for €500 million. This a fraction of the value of your aircraft. It’s as though the airline has given up and said “forget it”. We’ll go through the motions of operating it until we’ve be taken over by someone actually capable of doing so. For the benefit of your customers, the sooner that occurs the better.",,,,,
"  Air Europa is probably the worst airline in Europe. Do not use them. My elderly mother booked a business class return flight for a wedding in Madrid in May 2023. She was emailed a week before the flight to say that there were strikes over the dates of the flights she had booked. She called customer Air Europa services to get some more information, however they couldn't confirm whether or not the strike would affect her flights. Not wanting to risk missing the wedding, she booked other flights with a separate airline. When she tried to cancel the flights with Air Europa, she was told the strikes no longer impacted her flight and she could not cancel. The customer service representative also talked over her for the entire conversation. Pathetic, thoughtless and obstructive service. I have experienced better communication from small national carriers in Africa and the subcontinent. Don't be scammed into booking with them.",,,,,
"  Worst customer service. Will never use again. Not willing to be there for their customers. I was on time but in a long line with a lot of people, by the time we got to the ticket counter we were told our flight is closed for check in. They send us to their customer service across from the ticket counter, which had another huge line. At customer service we were told sorry, you will have to pay additional $260 to re book next flight 4 hours later, and saying we should of came 2-3 hours before the flight. I asked how come you are charging us since we paid for that ticket. They said if i came 10 min ago they would. We paid and re booked. Even their customer service said same on the phone as in person, we are late and should come earlier. ",,,,,
"  The worst airline on planet earth. That changed the gates over 5 times from one side of the terminal to other, flight was delayed numerous times. Customer service non existent, in fact very rude. Business class was a ripoff. The worst experience by far. Never again. ",,,,,
"  I would begin with advising people not to use this airline. I was recently booked to travel from Zurich to Santa Cruz in Bolivia, via Madrid. The flight to Madrid was constantly being delayed, eventually six hours past the original scheduled departure the flight was cancelled. At this point it was past midnight and passengers were told to collect bags and find a hotel in Zurich. We were informed that this hotel cost would be reimbursed by the airline, Air Europa. I finally arrived at a hotel at past 1am. Subsequent attempts to obtain reimbursement of the hotel costs have been refused by Air Europa, as they state it is not their responsibility! Similarly, denied any responsibility to provide compensation, we were provided with one CHF5 meal voucher during the 6 hour delay. In addition, the airline were to advise passengers of rescheduled flights. I called the customer services at around 6am, but they initially denied responsibility for rescheduling flights and then I called again at 9am to be informed I was scheduled for 12 mid-day flight. I received no notification of this either by text, email, WhatsApp or direct call. AirEuropa has also denied responsibility for any form of compensation. I started my journey Sunday morning and finally arrived on Tuesday morning, after spending 12 hours sat in Madrid airport waiting for the rescheduled connecting flight. On the return journey from Bolivia to Switzerland I went to check-in online but could not find my reservation. I had to call Switzerland, only to find that Air Europa had cancelled my return flight "" as I did not take the original flight""! Obviously I did not take the original flight as they had cancelled it, and rescheduled for the following day. I travel extensively for work and can quite honestly say this is the worst airline I have ever had to deal with.",,,,,
"  Airline pretended Not to know about the airport strike on Feb 17th. But you have to take the flight from Munich to Madrid, otherwise you can not board in Madrid. We traveled on our own cost to Madrid to get the connection to Santo Domingo. Boarding was ridiculously ineffective and takes forever. On the way back differently but bad. Flight attendants were extremely unfriendly and rude to me on way back from Santo Domingo to Madrid on Feb 28th. Never again. Not even cheap!",,,,,
"  Pleasantly surprised. There was a full bar service (to pay) on the domestic sector. The meal service on the long haul initially seemed poor was it was only one dish (2 choices) plus a bread roll, butter and small square of cake. However both the chicken and pasta was excellent quality and a generous portion. They was a pay bar service with sandwiches throughout the flight - no second free meal. The crew were great on both legs, interestingly more men than women but helpful, keen to please and professional.",,,,,
"  The worst airline ever. Think twice before you book a flight with them. My round trip has been a nightmare. In my first flight to Peru my luggage was broken and 2 pairs of sneakers were stolen. I filed the claim in the airport and the person in charge corroborated the damage. but then when I called the airline they requested multiple thing such as a police statement, the statement of a luggage shop that can confirm that the luggage was broken and other details.",,,,,
"  Worst airline I have ever flown with. Worse than Ryanair or any other low-cost airline I have experienced, although Air Europa is a member of Skyteam and should provide a very good level of service. Appalling. Cabin staff are extremely disgraceful. They don’t provide free water or coffee on long-haul flight neither headsets to watch the very few films they provide. Seats are extremely narrow. The aircraft is almost new but badly taken care of, dirty. Worst flight ever. I would definitely give them a 0/10.",,,,,
  We were on the flight for 13 hours. Within the first 2 hours they had served an evening meal with a cold drink They then brought around coffee After that the lights went down and that was it. No water or anything to drink the rest of the flight. ,,,,,
" Worst company ever, worst customer service ever. Always late, don't give you any information, make you wait for hours for nothing. My flight got cancelled and I had to struggle for months to get the EU legal compensation, they do not answer your messages, their flight are always late/cancelled and good luck for the wait and get the compensation cause it will never come. A company to flee from. Never take this company, really it's even worse than Ryanair.",,,,,
" One of the worst companies to fly with especially when doing transatlantic flights. In a 10 hour flight they provided 1 hot meal, ot even a snack, nothing. Also, they only offered 1 time drinks. The other two times they were doing the “service” everything needed to be purchased. Furthermore, they don’t even provide you with headphones that every airline does in these kinds of flights. You have to pay for the headphones additionally. The cabin crew was always in a rush. They don’t even told the other passengers to straighten their seat when we were eating, they only did it when we told them to. We did 2 times transatlantic flights with this company and we won’t again. Disorganized and not cheap at all for economy class and considering the service provided.",,,,,
"  I flew with Air Europa from ZRH to EZE via MAD in Business Class. The experience was outstanding. Flights on time, excellent business class hardware product specifically the new and super comfortable business class seats on the Boeing 787-9, outstanding meals on the long haul flight from MAD to EZE (incl. best coffee ever served on a plane), very attentive and motivated cabin crews. All this at an amazing price of CHF 2,950 per PAX (and booking was rather short notice in December 2022). I usually only fly Swiss and Lufthansa on routes to South America but I have to say Air Europa is much better in Business Class and at the same time their pricing is by far better. Air Europe can definitely count me in going forward.",,,,,
"  Second time I flew with Air Europa, second time they lost my luggage. Getting in contact with the customer service is a pain in the a. Calling from Cuba on a regular phone costs 4 dollar per minute, The quality with VOIP is very limited and the English skills of their staff very limited. The online tracking of my luggage didn’t work before they opened their office. Then it was impossible to save the changes I had to make. Calling them seriously tests your patience. I waited on waiting lines for more than 2 hours.I asked the account several times to talk slow and louder because the connection was so bad. She hang up! This customer service is by far the worst I’ve ever experienced. ",,,,,
"  First time flying with Air Europa from New York to Las Palmas. I was surprised early on that the sinks in the bathrooms were not working - at least 2 in the economy cabin. I understand for short haul flights but for such a long one to expect hand sanitizer is enough? Usually with red eye flights to Europe - at least what I've experienced is that they try and serve quickly as possible to maximize sleep time but the crew certainly took their sweet time. Had a 4 hour layover in Madrid - it's quite a long walk from T2 to T1 so glad we had plenty of time. 1 out of the 2 bags checked in didn't make it to my final destination. When you pay double the price due to inflation as well as for bags, you'd expect slightly better customer service but there is no information at all - whether it made it to Madrid in the first place or any information at all. Certainly does not care about the customer and will never fly again with this airline.",,,,,
"  Worst customer service ever. The staff at embarking point particularly a lady checking the boarding pass was super rude, she did not hide her anger against many customers. She accused us multiple times of breaking the line, while she was allowing people of later groups to skip in front of us, then when my husband asked why, she threatened him to not allow us to embark, it was very unprofessional.",,,,,
" Absolutely the worst airline ever. You can never fit your luggage, the staff are incredibly rude, oversold tickets, could not continue my journey to Frankfurt and got stuck in Madrid because of being oversold. Now of course I have no luggage because they took it and sent it to FRA, truly the worst customer service and airline I ever encountered, I am a pilot myself so I know!",,,,,
"  LGW to COR return November 2022. Air Europa could be a smart, customer friendly budget airline but it isn't. Long haul flying with them is an endurance. Ground staff badly trained & disorganised with chaotic boarding procedures experienced at LGW, MAD and on the return from COR. It seems to be their speciality. PAs often garbled and made in Spanish only. There is no reasonable excuse for serving passengers only one meal on a 10 hour long haul flight. Expensive snacks sometimes available. I paid 5 euro for small bottle of water & pringles LGW to COR Unless you pay extra for reserving your seat during the online check in process, it is unlikely you will be able to sit in the part of the aeroplane that you would like. Air Europa markets itself as a budget friendly long haul alternative to the legacy national carriers. By the time you add all the additional costs for seat reservation, onboard catering etc it isn't It's only worth travelling with them if they offer a direct flight alternative not available with anyone else.",,,,,
" Truly one of the worst business class products on the market (I'm a frequent flyer and usually fly about 12 a month). Unfriendly staff both in the air and on the ground, the most unappealing ""food"" imaginable, late flights virtually guaranteed. Do not recommend.",,,,,
"  Let’s start with a 8 hr flight and only one meal. Drinks served are really shot glasses. It’s truly your Europe spirit airlines. From the point of contact at ticket agent not the most friendly but not rude on our way to Spain the crew was once again not friendly and seemed upset if we asked for anything so now it became rude. Well I just shook it off as they must be tired, I have been in travel industry for many yrs. I was wrong on the way from Spain to Miami ticket agent not friendly took passports and reservation no smile no how are you just group number we were a group of 4. She gave us our tickets and neglected to even tell us she did not put us all together and put us all in the middle seat spread out. Okay maybe it’s a full flight so I let The flight attendant know I was interested in changing my seat he said sure. But made no attempt to assist me when I went back to where my son was sitting I saw many seats available but once again I had all my stuff in my seat so I decided to stay in my seat. Later when I decided I needed some water I turned my light on to call for the flight attendant he then turned off my light several times without assisting me. So I gave this airline a try but with this experience I have to say poor service, do not recommend at all.",,,,,
"  On my return flight from Madrid to Miami I experienced one of the worst services I have experienced with an airline. My wife is 9 weeks pregnant and on the return flight the staff was extremely rude and disrespectful. My wife was not feeling well once we entered the plane. I walked back to ask the flight attendant for some water and they rudely explained that they are not to give water in the beginning and if I new that my wife was not feeling well, I should have planned accordingly prior entering the plane. After I pleaded to please let me have some water, they provided some. The staff took no consideration what so ever.  We had entered the flight early because we had priority boarding.",,,,,
"  I was a little concerned for my flights with Air Europa as most of the reviews are bad, so it's save for me to say that I was very pleasantly surprised. Apart from the almost 1h delay from Lisbon to Madrid (which did not interfere with the connection flight, since we had a few hours between flights) everything went as smoothly as could be. The 787 provide great flight conditions, the staff was polite and available. The company offers a complimentary meal for transatlantic flights and I have to say it was one of the best meals I had in a flight. Everything went perfect from LIS-MAD-JFK and back. I would definitely fly with Air Europa again and recommend.",,,,,
"  
The worst airline. We got stuck in the airplane for 3 hours for “mechanical error”. And we reached Madrid 5 hours and a half later than schedule. This resulted in me missing my flight with KLM to Amsterdam even thought I had 4 and a half hour transit time. When I got to Madrid my flight was gone even though it was delayed another hour. When I went to Air Europa office they basically told me “tough luck”, and fill out a complaint form. I ended up spending money to book a flight (earliest was next morning), to book a hotel room to spend the night, and transportation back and forth. I also ended up missing a day from my Amsterdam trip, not to mention losing my hotel reservation there because of a “no show” status. It has been two weeks and they didn’t refund me for nothing. They didn’t even have the decency to respond to my complaint or say sorry!",,,,,
"  I flew twice with Air Europa. During the first, my suitcase took a big hit and was deformed, then during the second, the bottles neatly arranged inside were all broken. This company is incompetent when it comes to taking care of your luggage, this is a clear lack of respect for its customers.  J'ai fait deux vols avec Air Europa. Pendant le premier, ma valise s'est pris un gros coup et a été déformée, puis pendant le second, les bouteilles soigneusement disposées à l'intérieur ont toutes été cassées. Cette compagnie est incompetente lorsqu'il s'agit de prendre soin de vos bagages, il s'agit d'un clair manque de respect envers ses clients. ",,,,,
"  This flight was bound to go wrong before it even took off. 2:30 AM flight leaving Alghero arriving in Madrid at 4:30. The inbound fight from Madrid had taken off at midnight so the crew were already exhausted. There was still no excuse for their behaviour. No welcoming or good byes to any passengers, no service and literally yelling at three older couples who had forgotten to put their mask on before entering the flight instead of politely informing them. The flight was the only one leaving Alghero at night. Forget the shops that were obviously closed, there was not even a possibility to buy water at the airport prior to the flight (vending machines empty.) This flight needs to be moved earlier or by all means later but the airport and cabin crew of Air Europa could not handle it on this occasion.",,,,,
" 3rd time on Air Europa and it has been a very satisfying experience. On time, clean and modern aircraft, friendly crew on the ground and on board. Never had an issue with them and I would be happy to fly them again.",,,,,
" Chaotic / disorganized boarding. Older male member of Air Europa/Swissport was yelling at business class passengers: ""if you want to fly you need step back and listen to me"". Very rude and unprofessional. Some older passengers got shaken by his attitude. I have complained to local Air Europa female supervisor who did not supervise boarding. Instead she was hiding below the escalator with a male colleague. That is a clear job failure! They had no announcement about delayed boarding. They do not have boarding group lines organized and clearly marked. We had a similar experience in January in Madrid. Disorganized check in and chaotic boarding seems to be a chronic disease of Air Europa. It spoils passengers experience and the reputation of the airlines.",,,,,
"  This was the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline, first I checked in online from both flights going to Rome and coming back to nyc and both times their app said I was able to leave luggage at a drop off counter and proceed to security. In neither JFK or FCO does this airline have any luggage drop off counter, both times we waited 45 minutes just to check luggage. Secondly every flight, 4 in total, was delayed by an hour or more, and we were seated on the plane to wait during this time. The plane were extremely hot and uncomfortable, I witnessed and elderly couple ask for water and I watched as they were snubbed and spoken to rudely by the crew. On my 8 hour flight from nyc to Rome I reserved and paid for extra large seats a $220 cost, only to arrive on the plane and see that I had been moved to a middle seat in the middle of the plane. When I spoke to the crew they told me there was nothing they could do and I would have to ask for a refund upon arrival to our destination. I then saw the crew filling up the empty seats on the plane with standby flyers. I’m not opposed to this but wouldn’t it have made more sense to offer to move me and my husband? We paid for seats don’t get an apology or anything just brushed off by staff that seemed bothered I had even spoken to them at all. I feel like I was scammed, this airline should be formally investigated. Worst experience I’ve ever had I will never fly with them ever again and I hope no one else ever does either.",,,,,
" São Paulo to London Gatwick via Madrid. This is a joke/disgrace of an airline. We had booked with 2 adults and 2 children (ages 5 and 3). They placed us in separate seats. On check in they demanded that we pay extra for the privilege of having our toddlers sitting with us. With this ransom over our heads, we paid extra. On getting to the gate, despite us showing our online tickets, they demanded we go to a separate desk (with 30 minutes wait) to print the tickets. We got to the print desk, and they didn't have the updated seats we'd paid for at check in. Despite us having a 3 year old and having paid to be together the staff of this disgusting airline insisted we all sit apart. We spent the first ten minutes of being on the plane negotiating with various kind, unlucky customers seat swaps. During the 10 hour flight, we were offered one  meal and they also rationed water. There were several minor other gripes that place this airline way below its peers by itself but won't trivialise the above by going into details. Do yourself a favour and NEVER, NEVER use this disgrace of an airline. Employees there should feel ashamed.",,,,,
"  I flew with Air Europa from Brussels to Bogota and from Lima to Brussels this summer and I was very disappointed at their services. The staff put me at the back of the airplane while knowing that I had a connecting flight in Madrid. The plane left Brussels with a 2 hour delay and I almost missed my connection. When I finally made it to Madrid, there were no indications and no help. The flight from Lima to Madrid was even more terrible. The plane was delayed for 5 hours and I missed my connection in Madrid. After a 12 hour flight and a 5 hour delay, I was obliged to wait for another 6 hours at Madrid Airport to catch the next flight to Brussels. When I asked for compensation, Air Europa refused to reimburse me. The company said that the delay was due to ""unforeseen circumstances"" and I thus don't qualify for a refund. Please save yourselves some time and energy. Air Europa is a company that doesn't respect its clients and their needs.",,,,,
"  Awful service. They didn’t give me any seat when I was doing the check in. I arrived to the airport 3 hours before the flight, I didn’t have any luggage and they told me to go to the main door and they will give me the seat. My surprise was when I arrived there and they told me to wait until the end for them to give me a seat. Very rude staff. I will not fly with them anymore and I will not recommend anyone doing that.",,,,,
"  My daughter and friend landed in Honduras after connection in Madrid. Their final destination - long trip in Guatemala. In Honduras the found out the friends suitcase didn't arrive. Since then, over a week, no one is assisting them in finding the suitcase which included medicine and many personal items. It ruins their trip. Don't fly with them, they don't give customer service at all.",,,,,
"  We booked and paid online. We arrive 2 hors before departure before being told we were on standby. Reason was a massive overbooking, the plane was delayed by 1.30 hours. We waited again to be told no one deemed overbooked will board. We has to retrieve our luggage to start again. The staff didn’t understand the sky team highest status saying there was no business class on the flight. Try to explain the difference between a priority status and a seat class to a wall was easier. Avoid at all cost.",,,,,
"  In 2020 we booked a flight from Salvador, Brazil to Amsterdam, Netherlands. Covid stopped all travel. Air Europa cancelled our flight and rebooked and rebooked because Air Europa refused to refund. So we got stuck a voucher which worth nothing with these people. We finally decided to book a trip to Madrid because it is the only we can some of our money back. After nearly 2 hours talking to the ""service desk"" of Air Europa, we finally booked the flight for October but we had to pay a small amount extra. Ok, so we paid, however when we received the confirmation email, we also received confirmation that we still have a credit with AE. Very strange because we had to pay extra so how can we still have a credit. We called the so-called service centre again and they admitted that they made a mistake but when we asked for a refund for the extra money we paid, they refused because this was money for taxes or something like that and that they cannot refund. It is not the amount of money because it is only EUR 20 but it is the way they keep on stealing your money that makes me angry. So just a warning don't book any trip with Air Europa because they are basically totally unreliable and dishonest.",,,,,
"  This is the worst airline we have ever flown with. We flew London - Madrid - Havana return. The staff were rude. The food was awful and we were not offered a choice. You are allowed only 1 drink, the rest you have to pay for. Having flown overnight to Madrid we asked for a coffee and told the coffee was served 10 minutes ago, so it is no longer available (even though you have to pay for it). They lost our baggage.",,,,,
  I was flying within the European Union and the employees of this company at the check-in desk did not know that I did not need a covid test. I almost missed my flight.,,,,,
"  After touring and meeting so many wonderful people in Spain and other countries, what a complete letdown for us to have returned home with this airline. From a ticket agent who did not understand their company policy on Covid to being very sternly spoken to in the boarding process after paying for priority boarding to being lectured about patience for needing water to upgraded seats. We paid for then twice, they tried to make us pay for them again then to learn they really are only bulkhead seats allowing you to be near the sights and smells of the toilet! Again, after such wonderful people and sights in Spain the attitude and treatment we felt will make certain we never allow our agent or cruise line to book us with them again.",,,,,
"  We were told that we had to book the suitcases and seats with the flight operator (Air Europa). So I went to their website to book the seats and suitcases. After a ridiculously high amount of money I booked and paid everything. Later it turned out that this reservation had not been made and that I did not book anything. Called several times, but all to no avail. The service is extremely hard to reach. You get put on hold and just hang there for an hour with no answer. Lost my money, i have no suitcases and no seats.  They do not return my money nor give me me seats and luggage.",,,,,
"  I have never been able to travel with Air Europa. I had purchased the Milan-Panama ticket in February 2020, the flight was scheduled for the dates 31 March-12 April 2020. Due to Covid19 the flight was obviously cancelled. I was first informed that the ticket was non-refundable, but I could get the voucher valid for one year. As I could not use the voucher for the year (as flights were continuously cancelled), I was informed that I could get a refund for the ticket. I have not received a reply by email since April 2021, not even by certified mail. When I call, I am told that I am still in a long queue, to send an e-mail, to which I obviously do not receive a reply. Very bad customer service.",,,,,
"  Had 4 flights in total with Air Europa Munich -> Madrid -> Marrakech and back. All flights arrived ahead of schedule, carry on luggage rules were far better and some other airlines, one regular carry on 10KG plus a little bag it was the first time for me with this airline, before COVID I used to fly a lot for work and leisure with quite a couple of airlines and was positively surprised by this airline. For me its ok to get no drinks for free on the plane, its most important that the flights are on time and this was always the case. Seats were also comfortable, you even could lean backwards a bit, which is not possible anymore in some other low cost carriers.",,,,,
" London to Havana via Madrid. I have just finished talking to yet another operator and she tells me that unfortunately, she can only check that the file has been sent correctly. Poor thing, I would also be sorry to blame the operators who are not to blame for this situation. I have been waiting for 2 years for your refund on a ticket of nearly 600 GBP. My ticket was for March 2020. Following various complaints due to the pandemic, I was given a voucher that I could reuse for another hypothetical flight. One year later, it was still impossible to travel and think of making another ticket, so following the various complaints, I was able to speak with an operator with whom I would have started a refund procedure (March 2021). I also received an email confirmation for my refund, the operator had announced that it would take 5 months to receive the refund and I accepted the continuation I started to contact Air Europa without ever having an answer or an update nothing at all. It's been 2 years now and I still don't know what happened to my money. I also tried to use the voucher out of desperation but it wasn't even valid anymore. I don't know what to do, this situation has become ridiculous and also very annoying ",,,,,
"  Excellent in all respects. The food is brilliant, best ever had on an airline. Comfy lie flat seats, friendly and attentive cabin crew. ",,,,,
" Overnight flight Miami to Madrid on Air Europa's new business class. Excellent in all respects. Ignore old reviews. Their business class is now one of the best amongst European carriers and strong competition with worldwide carriers. Far better than Iberia or BA. Best food ever had on an airline, comfy and roomy lie flat seats (I'm 6 ft tall), lovely and efficient cabin crew throughout the whole flight.",,,,,
 The business class on the travel day was not even half full and the flight attendant took my menu choice. An hour after take out when the food was ready she came to inform that I was the only unfortunate that could not get the menu that I wanted. This is unprofessional toward someone who spent a good amount of money for a ticket.,,,,,
  It was a very bad experience with Air Europa. They cancel the flight UX072 from Caracas to Madrid without any notice and I had to wait in a hotel for 4 nights and book another flight with another airline because Air Europa customer service didn't confirm an alternative flight and they didn't confirm the refund yet. Calling their call center was a nightmare every time I had to stay on the line for almost 30 minutes to speak with an agent without any solution.,,,,,
"  They didn't let me board because they didn't accept the proof of vaccine on paper instead of the NHS.  I was promised by three staff members that they were gonna take my bag out since it was a connecting flight, yet they didn't, and sent it to London. There was no apology or anything like that, , they sent me to their main office, which sent me to a different office, which sent me to baggage claims. Had to book another flight and an hotel for the night, the whole thing costed me almost £500. If you can avoid them at all costs.",,,,,
" I flew in December to London to Bogota in business class. The staff was amazing and food and all the others service was excellent but I return on Friday arriving yesterday afternoon to London in economy class and the service was very poor. We were offered just one meal in the night of the departure and for the rest of the trip we had to paid the other meal. As I know the other airlines are offering two meals when the journey is long, making us to pay the other meal and we have to pay for the headphones while other airlines offer this service free.",,,,,
"  We booked ticket from JFK to Madrid but flight was canceled due to covid but they didn't refund money, but provided voucher. Due to travel restrictions we could not travel and anytime we try to book the price is almost twice than I am getting in other better airline so ultimately I am going to lose the money.",,,,,
"  Chaos during check in, poorly designed check in area. The airline asks you to download all documents to their website / Covid test, Vaccination certificate, Attestation, you get a boarding pass but when you arrive to Terminal 1 the business class agent has no idea about this process. He did not even have a computer. Luggage check in was smooth. Priority lane for security unpleasant and slow. Boeing 787- cabin with 1 -2-1 lie flat seats, nice staff. Cabin overheated. Only 1 wc available.",,,,,
" They were offering money and hotel for any whom offered to stay until the next day flight. We did not accept as we needed to travel. 30 minutes prior to take off, they bumped us, as we had not boarded by then and closed the flight. Refused to allow us to board and said the ticket office would replace our tickets for the next days flight. My 7 year old daughter was crying as we were denied boarding and the rude gate attendant, whom I regret not taking her name said to her ""this is your parents fault, so don't cry"" I asked to her why the she said that to my daughter and she began to insult me and requested we leave the international terminal.  It took us over 1 hour to get to the other terminal ticket office. The attendant said we had to pay for a 1 way ticket for each passenger as it was our fault for not boarding plane 1 hr prior to take off, and That paying for new tickets were the only option. I will never use Air Europa again and we do not recommend it to anyone.",,,,,
"  I expected the worst due to reviews on here, but was pleasantly surprised with Air Europa. Check in was done through my phone the night before the flight, boarding was a breeze, the flight itself was completely packed. Crew were pretty straight forward and courteous. No free drinks onboard but i managed to buy some OJ for 3 Euros. My ticket included a carry on item plus my backpack. Glad to have chosen Air Europa for this flight. Inflight entertainment was turned on for the full flight.",,,,,
"  This is the worst airline ever. Could not check in online, called a dozen times and the call would drop, and when I arrive at the airport, the crib service is not available because of that. I had to fly 10 hours with my baby on top of me. They should close.",,,,,
" Air Europa is not as bad as people suggest. With budget airlines I am a great believer that one should start at 10 and take of points for what you don't like rather than with ""posh"" airlines the opposite. Bought my one way ticket for around £150 worth of airmiles so cheap as chips and consequently in fairness I should rate this airline with consideration to the fare paid. I've read reviews about Air Europa and feel like I must be flying a different airline. Check in was efficient and both members of staff were very helpful. I got given an exit seat at no charge (I am skyteam elite plus this probably helped). Air Europa use the cibelles lounge in T2, I had a very nice lunch in a relaxing setting before my flight. Boarding straightforward, plane new and clean. Flight left on time, we are scheduled to arrive on time. Meal was basic but tasted good. Reasonable selection of drinks, I am not an expert on wine, I guess it was cheap but was fine, the little dessert was delicious. Staff are friendly on this flight. Seat was old fashioned but consequently more comfortable than others I have sat on recently. Entertainment also not the best but some good films on a nice screen. So starting at 10 where do I dock points? I don't like they charge for ear phones but the next cheapest flight was a 100 quid more so money in the bank to pay 3 euro for earphones. There simply is nothing wrong with this flight so I am going to give it a ten.",,,,,
"  The flight itself was okay regarding plane and onboard entertainment, as well as punctuality. However, leg room is very little and the on board service is an very disappointing for an 11hr flight. Everything extra except for one meal (no choice) and water. Flight attendants also are not necessarily very nice. Ground service is the worst I have seen. You are randomly assigned a seat even if you fly as a couple that booked together. There is no way to change this. Online check-in in advance was not possible. Would not recommend the airline again. Their advantage however is clearly the price.",,,,,
"  Terrible, very bad customer service. Extremely unfriendly staff, unclean aircraft, horrendous food. Nor worth the money, simply do not travel with this airline. I don't know how can they still be in the market, have the impression even Ryanair is better and friendlier. This is the type of airline who make you feel so unwelcome and uncomfortable that just by flying with them your holiday is ruined.",,,,,
"  I could not take my flight and asked for the taxes to be refunded. One told me this is non refundable, another one tells me their commission is higher than the taxes so no refund, and another one tells me if they ask for a refund, the airport will probably reject it. Seriously, at what point did I ask you your opinion!? Never again!",,,,,
"  Boek nooit meer met deze maatschappij, bedroevend kleine zitplaats,eten weinig en slecht, broodje bevroren en keihard, weinig drinken, of je moet betalen, heb zowel in juli als recent 9 november dezelfde ervaring! Veel mensen klaagden en terecht! Advies: niet boeken is het geld niet waard! Never book with this company again, pitifully small seat, food little and bad, sandwich frozen and rock hard, little drink, or you have to pay, have the same experience both in July and recently 9 November! Many people complained and rightly so! Advice: don't book, it is not worth the money!",,,,,
"  Unfortunately, last night I had the worst experience. I was waiting in a massive (more than long five flights had one queue for air Europa) queue for more than three hours. Eventually, I realized that it’s less than 30min left until take off. I went to ask what is going on, and the lady sitting by the desk told me that the gates are already closed. Nobody informed us that the queue is not just for the flight Lima, nobody informed that the gates are closing and nobody asked if there are people waiting to go to Lima. So obviously that made me very upset, because I lost not just this flight, but my next flight and all my tickets back from Peru. Plus, the front desk lady was extremely rude. Did not make any effort to help me out, offer me a solution. I am very disappointed and never flying with this airline again.",,,,,
"  Please never book a flight with this airline. I got stuck in Madrid with a group of 15 people that had all been overbooked. We were promised monetary compensation which I never received after months of dealing with customer support who simply sends out pre-written automatic emails. The few bucks saved are not worth the anger and frustration having to deal with their unprofessional service. I never write reviews, but after this experience I hope I can help somebody else not make my mistake again.",,,,,
" The worst flights we have ever had! There was nothing to eat or drink, the flight was dense and uncomfortable. We will never fly with Air Europa again. Oh! And I forgot the 3 hours line we waited in.",,,,,
"  I went to Ibiza for a long weekend. My luggage did not arrive, at all. Communication about the status of lost luggage is poor. Service desk can hardly be reached, refuse to speak English, though I mentioned in the dial-menu that I was English speaking. My luggage never arrived, so my weekend was rather ruined. I filed a complaint with all my damages, notes, etc. Despite many calls, emails. even 4 months later I have not been reimburse whatsoever. Very annoying, inefficient, customer-unfriendly to their bones.",,,,,
  My experience at the front desk was very unpleasant. On our ticket it indicated Madrid T1 but the airport screens indicated T2. So we went to T2 where they told us that we had to board through T1. We went to T1 and there was no staff at the indicated number. So we went back to T2 indicating to the priority person that there were no personnel in the indicated place and once again the screen indicated that our check-in area was terminal 1. The priority person only went to check the airport screen when we took out the platinum for life card. What a shame really. Our first and only flight on Air Europa. Mi experiencia en el front desk fue muy desagradable. En nuestro ticket indicaba T1 pero las pantallas del aeropuerto indicaban T2. Asi que nos dirigimos al T2 donde nos indicaron que teniamos que abordar por el T1. Fuimos al T1 y no habia personal en la numero indicado. Asi que volvimos al T2 indicandole a la persona de priority que no habia personal en el lugar indicado y yna vez mas que la pantalla indicaba que nuestra area de cheking in era terminal 1. La persona de priority solamente fue a revisar la pantalla del aeropuerto cuando sacamos la tarjeta platinum for life. Que verguenza realmente. Nuestro primer y unico vuelo en Air Europa. ,,,,,
"  One of the worst experiences ever. Hardly anything included, had to buy even earphones and in March 2020 all flights cancelled for about 6 months so I paid nearly £2,000 to get back home with another airline. For another 12 months I couldn’t ask for a refund and now need to wait 6 months for the refund to be processed.",,,,,
"  No Customer Care whatsoever, I booked a flight for my girlfriend, son and myself. Later on I realized that I would need to change the dates of my flight. I tried to call the airline to get a rate for changing my flight which turned out to be impossible. Calling the customer care number of Air Europa resulted in 5 calls of about 40 minutes waiting of which only one call got answered eventually. I was asked all the necessary details explaining my situation. Instead of helping me with changing my flight I was only transferred to another department and my call got hung up. I suspect on purpose. Calling again did not succeed, nobody answered the phone again. Also calling the airlines gate directly at the airport did not succeed, I was not attended. In the end I lost my flight receiving no compensation and had to buy a new flight for my new travel dates all due to the complete lack of customer care without any possibility to speak to a representative of Air Europe about my request. This is completely unprofessional and led to a very unprofessional experience.",,,,,
"  I haven't actually taken a flight with Air Europa because covid travel restrictions smashed my European travel plans. That being said I'm sitting on two round trip business class tickets that I need to cancel or get some type of future credit, but after trying 6 separate times to contact a customer service representative (phone, email, you name it) I am giving up. I have waited more than 3 hours on hold and have yet to have anyone answer. The support line says '24 hours' but on off hours you will just get a recording 'due to circumstances beyond our control, we cannot answer your call right now. Please try again in a few minutes'.",,,,,
  I booked flights from Valencia to Palma but my computer auto filled the 2nd passenger name. Realised within a few hours and have spent the last week and a half trying to get this changed. Started out very promisingly response to tweet was DM us the correct name. But despite numerous DMs and tweets absolutely no response. To re-rebook the flight now is 50% more.,,,,,
" I booked business because I wanted to use the priority boarding and also keep away from other people due to Covid. At Gatwick airport to get on the aircraft, there was no separate queue for priority boarding so we had to queue with everyone else not following the distance rule and some without masks. The business isn't worth the money you pay since you are treated the same as those in the economy. Very disappointed!",,,,,
"  Terrible experience with this airline! Just arrived in São Paulo from Madrid and it was so far the worst transatlantic flight experience that I ever had! My flight was number UX57, arrived on 12/08/21 around 04:40 in the morning) and all the flight attendants were very rude all the time, having many arguments with several passengers. They served only one option of dinner (in a 10 hours flight) and when they were asked about other options of drinks apart from water they said that they don’t provide for covid reasons. So I asked for a second bottle of water and I was told that I could get more at the back of the plane (so I should cross the whole plane for more water despite we shouldn’t walk in the plane or use toilets that are not next to our seat for covid safety reasons). When I finally managed to go to the back, they gave me a small glass of warm water and that was all we could get. Many seats were empty and despite the fact I was seating in the middle of two other passengers that I was not travelling with, I couldn’t move seats because is a rule in the company to not move seats. ",,,,,
"  Everything has gone wrong with this airline: from a 1 week delayed baggage, to poor and rude customer service. Even the website doesn't work properly and when it continued to tell me that it could not find my reservation number I was forced to once again call the treacherous service desk. Treacherous is the right word, as they can hang up on you at any point in the 45 minute queue to speak to an agent. Even once you do get to an agent they have hung up on me multiple times once putting me back on hold. In conclusion everything about Air Europa is horrible. Honestly shocked that so many people are still choosing to fly with them. I know I will never fly with them again and would strongly advise you to do the same.",,,,,
"  After being used to the overall good service and friendly attitude of the flight crew of Air Europa, it was very disappointing to see the decay in both. During the eight hours flight that departed Miami at 11:30pm, we were served only one meal, it was poor quality and only one choice, no drinks except water was offered during dinner. Snacks and breakfast were excluded “to prevent interaction between crew members and passengers due to COVID’. However, the “interaction” seemed unimportant for selling the same items such as sodas, sandwiches and wine during the flight. If costs need to be cut, be upfront with customer and do not insult customers intelligence by offering lame excuses. I understand new regulations must be enforced but flight attendant’s rudeness and lack of professionalism were highly unsuitable.",,,,,
"  Horrible lack of service. Flew with my special luggage, upon arrival my surf gear did not arrive. Upon requesting where my luggage was, the employee said it was not possible to contact anyone at the same company as this is not how they work. Nor could they verify where my luggage was. After filling in some paperwork they assured me all would be arranged and they would start looking for my luggage. I’ve been trying to contact Air Europa all weekend. Nobody can tell me where the luggage is, nor verify it’s even in their possession.  48 hours have passed and I still don’t know if i will get my stuff back.",,,,,
"  The Ryanair of long haul. That is to say, bad service, penny pinching and unpleasant flight attendants. I wasn't expecting much, but the meal was even worse than my low expectations. No choice of food so tough luck if you don't like meat and pasta. To drink, a choice of water or water. That was it. No breakfast, though you could pay 3 euros for coffee, not fresh of course. During the night, no water brought round and difficult to find. No attendants were to be found. I asked for a bottle of water before dinner. 3 euros to use earplugs to watch a film! More expensive than a lot of other proper airlines. The only positive - they left and arrived almost on time - I think both about 10 mins late so nothing major. All in all, a really unpleasant experience. I will not be using this company again.",,,,,
"  An 11 hour flight with just a 33cl water bottle, just pasta a la bolognese. Worse long flight ever for some that doesn’t eat meat and is used to drink at least 2l of water per day. ",,,,,
"  Still waiting for a refund for cancelled flights over a year later. Customer service is appalling. Understandable at the beginning of the pandemic that they would be busy, so had call waiting times of over an hour just to speak to customer services. Flight was booked in Feb 2020, and cancelled shortly after that. No confirmation of the cancellation till much later. Eventually reached someone to say that a refund was being processed in Sep 2020. Six months later after numerous follow up chasers to be told that refund is still in process - one year one month later and counting. Do not give them your money!",,,,,
" The pandemic is nearing it's end, and this companies website will not load its change reservation/booking page and their telephone system works periodically. On top of that they tried to charge me nearly £350 to change a flight. Absolutely disgraceful behaviour. I found the flight for the same money elsewhere as what they wanted to change the flight. A flight they charged me £500 for originally. Never again. Burnt, but learnt.",,,,,
  My flight got cancelled due to Covid-19 and dealing with this company has been absolutely shocking and almost non existent. It has been almost a year now and I still haven't seen my refund. Avoid at all costs.,,,,,
"  Our flight was cancelled in March 2020 due to the Corona outbreak. At the time, Air Europa had no technical infrastructure for handling refunds. There was no option to request a refund online. I called customer service and was told I could only have a voucher. I asked for a manager and noted that this is against the law in the EU. She said yes yes, you can get a refund, but the only way is to send an email to this address with your ticket information. I sent the email in March 2020, but received no confirmation or receipt acknowledgement. Since I received no refund confirmation, I believed no one would ever read my email. I initiated a dispute with my credit card in May 2020. Chase refunded me temporarily while they investigated. After a month, Chase denied my request and rebilled me in July 2020. They said it is not their job to enforce EU law, and the voucher offer was good enough. To get a cash refund, I had to get it directly from the airline. I reapplied for a refund with Air Europa in August 2020. Ever since then, they deny my requests because they say that their records show my dispute was successful and I need to get the money from my credit card. I have submitted to them the Chase denial letter, my credit card statements showing the rebill, and the date that my bank says they transferred the money to Air Europa. The denial letter from Chase very plainly states I was not successful. The customer service individuals refuse to properly communicate with accounting to find the money and confirm that my dispute was denied. They also lose my case information constantly, and I have to explain everything every time in an effort to get them to find records of when payments moved between Chase and Air Europa. I have two consumer complaints I am waiting for someone to help with. I am beyond upset as the tickets for my family were $2,500. This is the first time I've ever reviewed a company, because I'm not that passionate about the quality of services. I've likely wasted 30+ hours in the past year on the phone with them trying to get to the bottom of this. ",,,,,
" The worst airline we've ever taken. Being experienced travelers, Air Europa is in our opinion the worst airline we've ever taken in our lives. They cancelled our outbound flight Lima - Madrid without any notice - not for covid reasons, the customer service is unreachable and even at their office they refused to help us and to propose us comparative flight alternatives, besides the fact that my wife is pregnant (for that reason we bought business tickets) and needed to quickly reach home. They limited themselves to offer us an alternative flight 12 days after our cancelled flight.",,,,,
"  First timer here with this airline. Quite inline to my expectations, meaning: they are part of an air alliance, so they should be holding to a minimum service standard. Overall, it was ok. The best aspects of my flights experience: - Part of Skyteam, so my luggage transfer from KLM was easy and seamless - We flew with the Boeing 787, so it was nice and new - Decent flight crew service. The areas where AE can improve:  Their company site can be more user friendly as I had a bit of trouble trying to manage my booking prior to my departure - Seat selection is also not complimentary for everyone during web check in - Inflight entertainment has limited new movies Not bad overall, but I just wish they can offer free seats 48 hr before departure.",,,,,
"  Customer service very disappointing. It takes already more than 3 months to get a refund. Every time I call the customer service they tell me some other excuse, after I waited 30 minutes in line. One would expect a better organisation for such a big company. Next time other airline!",,,,,
" Flight was professionally operated, it was an economy class European flight, nothing special, but plane was new, well presented and staff friendly. Pay only refreshments which is more and more frequent but still disappointing. All in all decent flight, recommend Air Europa for short hops.",,,,,
"  On August 20th, 2020, Air Europa did not allow me to check in Madrid-Athens because my analysis said ""PCR negativo"" instead of ""PCR negative"". I insisted that the supervisor ask her colleague in Athens if the Greek police would admit such obviousness (the result can only say ""positivo"" or ""negativo"" so there is no doubt of interpretation), but she refused. Air Europa has management problems and, according to the press, is in technical bankruptcy. ",,,,,
" Horrible service. Paying 100 dollar extra for taking my own luggage. Only one miserable meal on an 11 hour trip. They cancelled my trip only 48 hours before take off because of Covid19, when the lockdown had started long before that. Alternatives were 10 times as expensive, so I had to take an United Airlines flight, with wonderful service btw. Still waiting for my money back after 5 months. Never ever in my life will I even consider flying with these crooks.",,,,,
" Horrible organization. 0 control of people and 0 monitoring of biosecurity measures and protocols. The fleet is handing out alcohol-free cleaning wipes that aren't even antibacterial. The plane looks like a jungle, passengers are moving everywhere and are talking in the aisle, being that it was clearly said at the beginning of the flight that crowds are not allowed in the aisles. People wear the masks without covering their nose, the fleet never distributed any alcohol in gel for sanitizing hands nor masks every 4 hours as it widely known and must be 100% know to airlines. There is no knowledge or transparency as to cleanliness, the Boarding was horrible, all the people piled up and the fleet of the plane controlled nothing. There are like 15 Air Europa workers on board (perhaps more) and none of them are doing anything. I paid to reserve my seat two days before my flight and upon arrival, I was printed the Boarding pass with the seat I booked. When I went to my seat there was a person with the same seat as me, no one in the fleet knew anything and they sent me to sit somewhere else, without giving me a solution. If you have claustrophobia or any reason for not being in a specific seat, never fly with this airline. The food felt like it was made for animals. The drink selection was horrible. Overall horrible experience, people being noisy, breaking every possible rule of biosecurity and the crew was doing nothing all day. I was forced to travel with this airline, but if I can choose again, I will never come with them again. It can be seen they have horrible communication and the crew onboard was useless.",,,,,
  I booked a flight from Amsterdam to Miami. They denied me boarding in Amsterdam because I lacked some documents to enter the USA because of Covid-19. They said I can re-schedule my flights for a later date through Aviapartner desk at the airport. After 1 hour of searching everywhere with little help . I finally found it. Aviapartner was useless and could do nothing for me. If you don’t let a client enter a flight the minimum you can do is give a voucher or re-schedule. I’m disgusted by their poor service. I will never use them again.,,,,,
"  Still waiting for cancellation refund. An atrocious company. On a trip to Cuba, I paid for extra baggage, which showed up on my ticket, but on check-in was told that it had not been paid for. After argument was allowed to board, but lied to by check-in staff and cabin crew about there being a desk in transit at Madrid where I could sort it out for return trip. Spent approx. 90 minutes on phone trying to get someone to sort it out, to no avail. Due to coronavirus, they cancelled return flight 3 days before its date, but didnt make any effort to contact me to inform me. I had been monitoring their website which is labyrinthine, and was totally without information. I only found out about cancellation when my son rang me from England, and he managed to book us on a flight with another airline at a cost of £3000. I have tried all ways of getting a refund, quoting EU regulations etc. After 4 months I have heard nothing since their original offer of vouchers.",,,,,
"  My Flights on June 9 was cancelled due to COVID 19, I contacted the company many times to get my money back but the company is not helping at all. They only offered a voucher, I don’t want a voucher a want my money back. Flights was cancelled due to The pandemic No for personal reasons. When I called the company only give me the option for the voucher or Send me to just fly to claim the credit. I been bouncing between both companies with not help and results. I know but the law that I am entitled to get my money back since the pandemic. Customer service need more training and be more helpful at this point I’m still waiting for the company response on this issue but I didn’t heard anything yet. I will never buy again a flight on air Europa or inJust fly is the worst experience!",,,,,
" São Paulo to Lisboa via Madrid. I liked the quality of the seat. Very good, very polite stewards. The food was not good on the way back but on the way it was good. Yes the very attentive ground staff (check-in). I recommend ",,,,,
"  São Paulo to Porto via Madrid. The flight UX58, from São Paulo to Madrid had a delay of 1 hour 54 minutes due to a technical problem. We had to stay inside the airplane, waiting for it to be fixed. Because of this delay, I lost my flight UX1147 from Madrid to Porto. After losing this fight I had to wait more than one hour in the line to change my ticket and got a ticket for the flight UX1145. After waiting for 1 hour after the departure time of UX1145, we were informed that the flight had to be canceled. The mentioned reason for that differed from announcement to announcement, but technical conditions were also mentioned as a cause of the delay. After that, I contacted the company to ask for compensation as Regulation 261/2004 of the European Union, but the company avoids fulfilling their obligation and tries to deny their rights. I do not recommend this company in any circumstances. The costumer support will not try to help, they do not care about the quality of their services and will not deliver the expected service or compensate for the huge mistakes made by the company.",,,,,
"  Madrid to New York JFK. Our flight was canceled and they did not inform us! Furthermore, they did nothing to help with out luggage, leaving us to deal with the mess they made! Never flying with them again!",,,,,
"  Madrid to Punta Cana. First time to travel with Air Europa, overall a very bad experience. Family with a toddler in emergency row seat. Horrified to find no entertainment system for travellers - a 9 hour flight with no entertainment in this day and age is simply antiquated. The plane was very old and shabby. The main meal was actually OK and free of charge. One drink was provided and a small plastic cup of water too if requested. If you wanted another drink it had to be paid for, yet this service was not always available and only when the cabin crew had finished their duties could we even begin to pay for another drink. The 2nd meal was paid for. During the flight I was so thirsty and with a baby sleeping on my arm I had to get up and try to get a drink of water. The cabin crew were sleeping or reading a book - it was a big ask to have some water - they were rude and sullen and begrudgingly relinquished a small cup of water. Never have I had this experience, normally cabin crew happily walk up and down the aisle with drinks on a tray. The service was absolutely diabolical. On the outbound flight our baby was refused a meal, despite the fact that he eats too. We were told that we should have specifically requested it yet nowhere was this information available. Imagine refusing to feed a baby! On the way back I made sure to request a baby meal in advance. Unfortunately no water was provided, when I asked for water the cabin crew refused until their current duties were complete. Unfortunately even after this no water was forthcoming. Imagine refusing water to a baby! This is a basic human right. What type of people are they? Simply the worst long haul flight I have ever experienced. The with-holding of basic human rights for a baby is simply beyond belief. I would not recommend travelling with this airline and will never fly with them again.",,,,,
" I will never ever pay Air France another dime after this humiliating flight. I'd rather go crawling on my face. On the way to the plane from Paris to Oran has not been cleaned between the previous passengers leaving and us boarding. So it was dirty and when I asked the flight attendant for wipes to clean it, she refused very rudely and told me, if you want wipes, get them yourself. Their hub is in CDG where we had to transit long enough that we left the airport and when we came back, I got pulled aside so that my carry on luggage gets weighed. Something that did not happen in Helsinki. Obviously most people have more than 8kg between backpack and carry on and was forced to pay 50€. This is only the case for Air France flights, as other flights went through other security lines. On the way back from Oran, they made us throw away liquids bought at the gates post security.",,,,,
"  I am so thankful that I flew with Air France. The flight was delayed but that happens sometimes and they took care of me from the very start until the end. I needed to catch my flight to Mexico and they informed me about everything multiple times during the flight. Even though I had only one hour at CDG and we had 20 minutes late I caught my flight! Thanks to very caring flight attendant who was so kind and explained me how to get to my terminal and gate the fastest way. Thank you and if I could I would personally give thanks to the crew on the plane! I recommend the airline since even with delay which is normal, they are doing their best to get you to your destination.",,,,,
 Had my flight cancelled by Air France they failed to get me rescheduled on another Air France flight. So we had to fly another airline. They failed to cover additional costs it took to fly another airline involved for the same day said they had operational issues. Hung us out to dry due to their failure,,,,,
"  The food and service in business class was horrible. For the dinner flight we were served a tasteless, overcooked and fatty piece of pork and the next morning the staff on the left side of the aircraft failed to serve several business class passengers, including me, our breakfast! Instead they stood in the front of the section talking to people and then cleaning up their trays before the rest of us had even been served! During the flight they never came around offering us any water. We had to go the galley and request it. ",,,,,
"  I booked 2 business class tickets for myself and my 2 year old daughter. A few weeks before my flight, I called Air France to check on the seating and meal arrangements for my daughter to ensure everything is confirmed. The 2nd time I called Air France was the day before my flight to make sure again if the seating and meals were confirmed. Both occasions, I was given the assurance that my daughter's child meal was confirmed and for seating, it is a priority she is in the appropriate seat next to me. During the flight, the attendant came to me and said the child meal was not booked when I did it 2 times. The 2nd issue is my seat was faulty.  I only realized when I was extending the seat, that it jammed and couldn't become a bed. I got off to check and saw my daughter's foot was stuck in this big gap as you see in the picture, by the metal piece stretching across the seat. This piece was visible and the cushion was falling off. I called the attendant and she quickly informed the chief steward who came and pulled the cushion away to seal it back to cover the metal piece.  Throughout the flight, the cushion kept sliding and I had to get off the seat to refit the cushion. Before landing, I couldn't fully recline the seat back to original position because of this big issue. The attendant had to put in a lot of strength to ensure the cushions fit correctly while reclining the seat. Finally it went back to original position but the belt was stuck and I couldn't pull it to secure myself for the landing. I had to sit on my daughter's seat with her on my lap for the landing. I filed a complaint to Air France, I wanted to cancel my return flight to book on another airline. This is what they responded. ""Thank you for your remarks concerning the special child meal you booked and your seat on your flight from Marseille to Singapore on July 10. Our staff reported that you were unhappy with your seat and inspected the seat. They found no defect or fault with the seat, for which reason I cannot issue any compensation in this case. There are no reports on our system indicating that the special child meal was not delivered. For this reason, I cannot respond favorably to your request. We look forward to serving your travel needs again in the near future and to welcoming you aboard another of our flights."" ",,,,,
" This was my first time flying on Air France business class product and it was nothing short of spectacular. The airplane has been in service for 21 years but extremely well-kept. The business class used on this particular aircraft was the extra legroom seats section in the very front of the aircraft, so the row had three seats, but the middle seat was not sold so it was the aisle seat and I had the window seat. The flight lasted under two hours however, the proper business cabin service was still offered. A cold towel pre-flight, and a full gourmet meal as soon as we reached cruising altitude. There is absolutely nothing to complain about, we left on time and arrived on time. Great job Air France! Merci!",,,,,
" I am extremely impressed with the business class product on this international flight. The airplane has been in service for 24 years, but extremely well-kept. We had an hour delay due to a technical issue with one of the navigation instruments however Air France allowed us to stay in the terminal and not on the plane, something that I extremely appreciate. I was very disappointed, however, with fellow business class passengers for giving the crew a hard time because we were late due to the fact that they were trying to fix one of the navigational instruments. Really? You get upset because the delay is a safety issue that they are trying to fix before we take off on a 9 hour flight? Thank you Air France for ensuring that safety came first. I would have gladly waited as long as I had to! Once up in the air, the business class service was nothing short of stellar, the meals were all gourmet by a three star, Michelin Chef, the in-flight crew was warm, welcoming, personable, and genuine. I have to say that after this experience, the business class product on Air France for me, comes in at number 2. Qatar obviously still holds the 1st place for me. This airplane had been upgraded to the new business class configurations 1-2-1. I had a window seat (7A) and even though overall, I am not a big fan of the new “business class pods” industry wide, the seat was very comfortable with plenty of storage, and the entertainment options were very good. Amenity kit, headphones, a very nice pillow and duvet were also offered in business class. One thing I loved about Air France is that they give you free Wi-Fi to send text messages via ‎WhatsApp, Messenger, iMessage, and a few other messaging platforms, so you really do not need to purchase an Internet package unless you want to stream. The Internet on this flight worked from gate to gate without interruption of service. Overall, next time I go to Europe, I will most definitely have Air France on my top list. They are offering a business class product that the rest of their competitors in this market are not. Merci Air France for a safe and wonderful experience onboard! I'm a fan!",,,,,
" Air France is a terrible airline with deceptive advertising and unresponsive customer service. We remain without fair compensation ($100 offered off a future flight). They made a significant change to my flight itinerary that I deem as an unfair or deceptive practice. The departing inflight entertainment service did not work for all three passengers. We were not informed until the flight was in the air, or we would have re-booked with a proper flight. Furthermore, I purchased these tickets with the promise that we would be served the menu prepared by Chef Mashama Bailey (our co-chef through the James Beard Foundation), but I received horrid food that was still frozen, not her menu or as advertised. Additionally, the staff lied numerous times when questioned if the food was vegetarian, they said yes – only to come back and inform me that they served eggs with chicken. We are strict vegetarians, which caused harm. On the return flight from Paris to JFK, again, I purchased the beauty of an Air France flight with all of its luxury and had a significant change of my flight itinerary that I deem unfair or deceptive practice to a Delta Flight. This flight lacked the services, food by Chef Mashama Bailey (or the Delta Business Class menu – we were served the economy class menu), wine, airplane, and staff that was purchased. The food, wine, flight accommodations, and staff were significant changes to the flight itinerary. This was terrible! This was my elderly mother’s last international flight, and your team should be ashamed for their lack of service, deceptive and unfair practices, while not fulfilling services purchased on this flight.",,,,,
" I would like to express my dissatisfaction with my recent flight experience with Air France. Unfortunately, my trip was marked by a significant delay, inadequate accommodations, and disproportionate treatment regarding the weight of my carry-on baggage. First and foremost, my flight experienced a 2-hour delay, which resulted in a missed connecting flight at CDG to AJA and disrupted my plans. The lack of effective communication and frequent updates on the flight status only exacerbated my frustration and discomfort throughout the waiting period. Furthermore, the accommodations provided by Air France were extremely disappointing. The hotel where I was accommodated was of inferior quality, with poor conditions and lack of air conditioning. The unbearable heat made my stay even more unsatisfactory and affected my rest before continuing with the journey. Lastly, I would like to mention the excessively strict attitude regarding the weight of my carry-on baggage. I was surprised by a severe reprimand from the airline staff due to just 700 grams over the limit in my carry-on bag, even though it was the same bag I boarded with in MUC. This disproportionate approach and disrespectful treatment left me extremely disappointed with the service provided. As a customer, I expected a comfortable and professional flight experience, but unfortunately, Air France did not meet my expectations. I request that you review your customer service policies with the aim of preventing other passengers from going through similar experiences in the future. As a result of this negative experience, I categorically state that I do not intend to fly with Air France again. I hope that this situation will be treated seriously, and appropriate measures will be taken to remedy the situation.",,,,,
"  Definitely worst experience checking in and on boarding. I came 2 hours before the flight, they had a very long line to check in. I went to the security, and after waiting a very long time to pass, they stopped me and measured my carry on, claiming it was 2 kilos over the 12 kilo limit. They sent me back to check in my carry on bag. I went back to check in and they just closed the check in saying I cant check in the luggage. They advised me to wear as much clothes as possible and try again... Horrible experience, never again Air France.",,,,,
"  Forced my to pay for my small hard shell bag and never made it. No one answers or emails you, had to spend days trying get my bag with all of clothes. Air France could care less and not following up on thousands of lost bags. They should have company taking these to travelers. ",,,,,
"  I have flown with Air France regularly because it is the only direct flight from South Africa to France where I study. I have always been surprised by how poor the food and service are on the route I take, but my last trip took Air France's utter disregard for passengers to a new level. After the plane was in Johannesburg for a whole day (available to be inspected and to make sure that everything on the plane was working) the flight got cancelled when we were already all boarded and ready to go when the pilot announced an issue with the air conditioning system. Even though I believe this was ridiculous already given all the time they had to check the plane, the worst was yet to come. The pilot gave a very unsympathetic announcement after we were sitting on the plane for two hours already that the flight is cancelled. Nothing else. The cabin crew advised us that the ground crew will assist us. Except that there were no ground crew when we got off the plane. One lady behind an obscure desk had no idea what was going on and a gent with her merely said to all the passengers that they should sort themselves out with accommodation, food and travel to the accommodation and then claim back. If all of this was already ridiculous, the worse was yet to come: trying to process a claim is a nightmare! Air France booked me on another flight 3 days later - without any correspondence with me. If I had taken this flight I would not have been able to graduate this year as I would've missed a key class in my studies. I urgently had to book another flight via Kenya to get to France in time for my classes. The whole process was so badly done that it proofed impossible to cancel the substitute flight without cancelling my return flight as well. There was no way of contacting anybody at Air France to assist in cancelling the replacement flight, but not cancel the return flight. No way to phone or e-mail. Air France doesn't even have an office area in Johannesburg where one can ask for assistance. The website is terrible and the AI used clearly doesn't cope with anything that is not stock standard. I am still struggling to try and process my claim. I have still not managed to connect with anybody at Air France that can assist to sort out the cancelling of the replacement flight. They claim you can connect with them on Messenger or Twitter, but don't be fooled, the AI chat bot doesn't work well and the supposed operators don't contact you as promised by the chat bot. Even the African Airlines are better than Air France. The customer service on Air France is terrible and it is clear they have no intent of actually providing a decent customer experience. Not on the plane, on the ground, on their website or in Charles de Gaulle airport. I would strongly advise passengers to look for alternatives and only take Air France if that is your only option.",,,,,
"  Flight was on time, crew was very welcoming, no delays, meals were top notch, value for money was very high, inflight entertainment was good too. The only problems were there was no wifi onboard, the check-in line was way too slow, and legroom was kind of tight. Even though that happened we will still fly with Air France again!",,,,,
"  One of my worst experiences to date. Do not take this airline. I went to the airport to check in just to be told that the plane had some issues and they had changed the plane to a smaller one, which meant I was on standby with a low probability to leave. After a two hour discussion with the staff, I was rerouted to Dakar, a flight supposed to take off 3 hours after my original flight, which was also delayed by one hour.",,,,,
" Absolutely terrible experience with this airline. I flew to Paris with my friend at the end of May and at the airport was informed that even though we paid and did everything correctly with the booking, for some reason tickets were not issued. They let us stay at the airport handing us a paper with contact for AF customer service, where after a longer wait they said they don’t know how to deal with the problem so they have to think about it - I guess not realizing we are under a time pressure and could miss the flight - already in pressure and missed the time we wanted to stay at the airport lounge. After some time, they came up with a solution - to pay for the tickets again, yes, double charge us (in fact it was a triple charge) and said the previous hold would be released within 3 days, which did not happen within the period of time, but in the end it did. They also did not disrespect our selected seat we had chosen in the booking and wanted us to sit separately and also let us wait the line at the counter again, even though we had already waited before and was denied because of the technical issue on their side. After this horrible experience I contacted the airline explaining what a terrible experience we had with them, however we were not asking for any compensation or refund. They replied in quite a long time saying they issued a refund. I was surprised that they actually acknowledged how much they failed, but it was sadly not the thing - for some reason they thought I was asking for a refund because of the previous hold payment, which I was not. That means they did not even read my complaint properly and after another week I received an email my refund was denied. So not even the customer service employees care about the complaints, they probably don’t even read it. This is the worst airline experience we have had so far and we have flown hundreds of flights combined. Thankfully there is a great competition in the European and world airlines market and it’s easy to avoid flying with this terrible airline, which also means avoiding their sister KLM (and whole skyteam) which have allied with this terrible company. Sorry not sorry!",,,,,
"  The policy ""handbag + accessory less than 12 kg"" can be accepted as legitimate, but what happened because of its infraction was too harsh. If you go over even 2kg, as in my case, you cannot pay for extra weight. You have to pay 60 euros for hold baggage, and that means that you have to use the machine and then hold the line to load the hold baggage. (Ironically, since my bag was 10kg, less than 12kg, they asked me if I wanted to carry it to the check in). The line got very long, between the weighting line, the hold line, and the check in line, and I almost lost the boarding time. They could just let me pay for my 2 kg extra on the place, and it would have been a normal process. Next time I will try to avoid Air France.",,,,,
"  This airline is a joke. They cancelled my flight and didn’t give any notice until hours before. They put me and my boyfriend on different flights home despite me being a young girl who is scared to travel alone. They are all full of attitude and are so unhelpful. I have never met such lifeless and cruel humans in my life before coming across their employees. When I explained to them that the flight they put me on would cause me to miss my university graduation, they laughed. Their chat is even more of a joke. They don’t even read what you say. Don’t fly with this airline unless you want to be treated without any respect. Their food also smells as bad as their employees.",,,,,
"  First a comment about Premium Economy on Air France. It's a joke. I could have been just a uncomfortable in Economy for several hundred dollars less. Food service was indistinguishable from economy. The seat was a bit wider but only reclined two inches. The space under the seat in front of me where I would have liked to stretch my knee-replacement legs was bisected by the legs supporting the seat. The foot rest and leg support were no help. Cabin service first round was a 6 ounce cup of Coke with no ice. Next cabin service came seven hours later. Same thing. So much for Premium Economy. The real treat came when we arrived on Monday May 29 in Naples, Italy. Our baggage failed to make the trip. So we stood at the baggage claim office in line for an hour to get what is called a ""Property Irregularity Report."" Meanwhile the driver who came to pick us up to drive us to Sorrento more than an hour away gave up on us and left. It took an international phone call to get him to return. We stayed in Sorrento until the morning of June 2 when we left for Rome. Our baggage finally arrived at the hotel 5 PM the night before we left. Four days without baggage. Air France did send an email with an apology for the inconvenience and admitted they were at fault for taking so long to return the bags. However the was no mention of anything that they would do to compensate for our ""inconvenience."" Be careful when booking with Delta for international travel as they are cross listed with AF for many flights.",,,,,
" This review pertains to their customer service when something goes wrong. They cancelled one of my flights. I had to scramble and take a train because I had all my vacation plans settled. I immediately filled out their forms while still in France. I spent two weeks of long hold times trying to get them on the phone. When I did, they made me fill out another form. I followed up using their messenger system which is a joke. It takes them 2 or 3 days to respond so the back and for of explanations takes forever. Messenger said it was refunded but couldn't tell a date or amount. I called again and they said it would take at least until July. This is absolutely ridiculous!",,,,,
" Would definitely never fly again with Air France or Delta. 1) I got my ticket from Delta and upgraded later to Premium Economy. The email I got from Delta says that my second checked luggage is free from JFK to IST (see attached photo). Air France ground crew at JFK said that it is free only for JFK to CDG and that I had to pay for CDG to IST although my bags were going directly to IST after checking in. Delta should have informed better as their email was grossly misleading. 2) My Premium Economy seat footrest was broken. It was basically not there so probably people who sat at this seat put their feet on the back pocket of the seat in-front of me so that was also broken (see attached photo). For an upgraded seat that I paid extra for it was uncomfortable and not worth it. A cabin crew member came later and told me they will send me a discount coupon of 45 euros on my next flight ticket with Air France and that is the only thing that they can do. 3) On both ways in CDG transfer while going to the US and coming back from the US and flying to IST there is a security control with long lines. Getting just out of one flight trying to catch another and you are again stuck with a security control. Overall I am very unhappy with my choices and would probably never fly again with Air France or Delta. And probably direct flight from Turkey to US would be better because the CDG is also not very entertaining and has very little options due to terminals/gates in terms of services, shops, food and lounges. These tickets are not cheap even if they are not upgraded and still the service and aircraft are not up to the standards. And when you upgrade and pay extra hoping that you will get some rest and sleep the seats don’t function as per my case.",,,,,
"  After years of improvement, Air France is reborn in quality. Very poor food. Seat pitch on long haul is very poor but very good entertainment service, and very good lounge for those who have access. I was a great defender of Air France for years, I am much less. Après des années d’amélioration, Air France renaisse en qualité Nourriture très insuffisante Personnel autain Le pitch des sièges sur le long courrier est très insuffisant Mais très bon service de divertissement et très bon lounge pour ceux qui y ont accès J’étais un grand défenseur d’Air France depuis des années, je le suis beaucoup moins",,,,,
"  Personnel attitude make the difference. On the way to Paris (see previous review) , everything went smoothly. Not on the way back. One of the rudest boarding I faced. Unpolite staff. No smile, no education. It seemed that we were bothering the two ladies. We entered the aircraft at a high level of stress. Turbulences and stress cockpit did not help then.",,,,,
"  Very quick check-in, boarding, flight and luggage delivery. Free coffee and soft drinks as well as a nice madeleine. Smiling employees everywhere. Perfect option for the route",,,,,
"  I was very happy with my overall experience. Staff was super helpful at the airport, not to mention the friendliness of the crew and captains onboard. On most airlines, the crew are either super salty or sickly sweet, and I would say this one was friendly and professional with authenticity. Flight was on time, arrived at CDG early, and all of our baggage made it to our final destination. I've flown with most airlines at this point, as I'm American and have to fly back home often to see family. I've had so many bad experiences with things not working properly, rude staff, unwillingness to help, unexplained cancellations, lost baggage, etc. This is one of the best flights I've been on. Spend a little extra to have the AF / Delta experience.",,,,,
" I had a tight connection in Paris and knowing AF's tendency to lose luggage, I took a normal carry on bag. The guy weighing the bag was a real jerk and forced me to go check the bag. One would think that a simple one way flight without any connection would be easy enough, but apparently not. They are still searching for my bag; the problem is probably further compounded by the fact that the gate agent put somebody else's name on it. I am never flying Air France again - this was the final straw after many bad experiences and screw ups",,,,,
"  Problems encountered during my trip on flight AF655 on April 14th from Dubai to Paris. Due to the health issues of the captain we had to make an emergency landing in Vienna, where we were disembarked by bus at Terminal 3 around 4 am. Upon arriving at the terminal an airport employee told us to go to the Air France counter at Terminal 1. At the counter, the hostess told us to go back to Terminal 3, where an Air France hostess would assist us. So we returned to Terminal 3 (after spending over an hour queuing at security) to once again find no Air France representative. I called Air France customer service multiple times, asking to be transferred to another flight (there were over 6 Vienna-Paris flights in the morning, including 3 Air France flights with available seats, as I checked on the internet). After being told that a seat was being reserved for me on the 10:05 a.m. flight, I was later informed that it was no longer possible but that I would be called back. I never received a call back, and despite my reminders, no solution or alternative was ever offered to me, nor was I kept informed. I spent over 10 hours in Terminal 3 during which time I was never contacted or met with an Air France representative, and I was never kept informed about the progress in resolving the issue. Five days later, I received a generic letter from Air France with vague apologies, congratulating themselves for doing their best to resolve the problem and minimize its impact on passengers. ",,,,,
  We traveled with Air France and had nothing but issues. We had a cracked screen in row 12L. The USB port was damaged and the Wi-Fi for the flight did not work. We landed in Boston on the evening of 15th May and waited for baggage claim only to not see our luggage. Staff told us to scan a QR code and fill it out. This is not customer service nor what they get paid to do.  Our luggage is still missing. ,,,,,
  We flew Air France to San Jose via Paris for a 2 week holiday returning on May 5th The in flight service was terrible with poor food and the crew did not come round to offer soft drinks or water. On our return flight the pilot announced that the plane was “too heavy” to take off so he offloaded all the luggage and told us that representatives would be available to help us in Paris. We arrived 4 hours late and so missed a connecting flight to Manchester. They knew nothing about the luggage and accused me of lying when I said that our bags had been offloaded. 5 days later our suitcases have still not arrived and Air France seem reluctant to process my claim. They are difficult to contact and have now asked me to list every item in my suitcase (who knows that?).,,,,,
" I was not able to take this flight. I canceled and they told me because my flight was non-refundable that they would give me a credit. What they FAILED to mention was that if I accepted the taxes back from the flight, it would WIPE OUT THE CREDIT! So I lost $1800.00USD. I called and spoke to their customer service department. I was disconnected several times, dealt with people whom couldn't connect me with a supervisor, and in one instance dealt with an EXTREMELY RUDE individual who told me to go to the website and complain. I will NEVER FLY with this company EVER!!!",,,,,
"  Will definitely fly again with them. Very professional cabin crew, very comfortable seats, clean aircraft / bathrooms, wifi poor. Very delicious meal had gluten-free chips which was impressive, ground service was poor. Very excellent value for money, very good entertainment system.",,,,,
"  All crew members were nice, good flight, no complaint there. The seats are not comfortable. The entertainment system is very poor in terms of choices and quality. Almost 1/4 of the headphones in our sector were broken. The table tray unstable. According to the wine list, we were supposed to have an aperitif. Forget it, the seat belt was on until they came with the meal. The dish labelled ""beef"" contained a sort of strong turkey, the potatoes not cooked enough. My wife choose vegetarian gratin - what you see is what you get. And you are supposed to cut these using wood cutlery.  For breakfast, too much sugar and a wrap with mashed meat including peppers. Nice with a coffee. You will not see me again, well done.",,,,,
"  We booked business class with 1x2x1 seat configuration with flatbed in a B777 from Paris to Johannesburg and back. On the outbound flight, AF changed the plane (B777 with other cabin configuration) 10 hours before departure and we were downgraded to premium Economy, because there were not enough seats in the business. On the return flight the plane also was changed (B777 with other cabin configuration) and we flew in a very old and narrow business class with 2x3x2 configuration and no flatbed. This is not fair business. We did absolutely not get what we paid for. ",,,,,
"  Full flight, delayed departure due to strike, arrived almost on time though. Seat was a bit small due to 2-2-2 arrangement which is a little bit inappropriate for this type of aircraft. Service was exceptional, the attitude of the cabin crew seems to be the strength of Air France. Food was excellent, signature of known chefs.",,,,,
"  Flight on time, last minute gate change to one at the periphery of Budapest airport. Lounge too small for so many customers, not comfortable. The service in the airplane itself was excellent, very professional cabin crew, customer-orientated, food was delicious. Seat was uncomfortable though (normal Economy with empty middle seat). Mixed experience overall.",,,,,
"  Punctual, good service with a cookie and drinks on this short 55 min flight. Flying on the 70 seater E170 made this flight less stressful, recommended",,,,,
" The most disgusting service I have ever taken. They charged $150 for 3 kgs extra without allowing me to change the staff to my cabin one. I asked for a refund hoping there will be some understandable humans behind the desk but they refused even that. A total disgrace and disappointment. Please people if you ever can avoid. They are over priced, no empathy, not understandable, scammers. Just avoid please.",,,,,
"  My first long haul flight since COVID. It was a pleasure to travel business class with Air France. The cabin layout is 1-2-1 which was excellent. Service was impeccable as expected with them. Had a choice to pre-order your preferred meal before take-off. Seat was comfortable and good entertainment on board. My only surprise was that guava juice was not available, something that was unexpected considering this is a very popular drink in Guadeloupe.",,,,,
"  Avoid AF if at all possible. Arrogant & rude cabin crew and the worst food I’ve ever received in the class of flight. Starting point was the cabin wasn’t fully ready even when the aircraft doors were closed ready for push back. Finally offered a welcome drink and I requested a Perrier Water but it never arrived and was later informed that, on the French national carrier, there wasn’t any. Dinner arrived and was so poor in terms of quality that I opted for some packet biscuits & chocolate. Wouldn’t have said no to some crisps but guess what - there were none. Took for ever to get a cup of mint tea after the ‘dinner’ service as all bar one of the crew disappeared. The best that can be said about the breakfast meal is that at least the fruit was edible - just. At least the seat became a full flat bed but my advice is avoid Air France.",,,,,
  I booked 3 seats next to one another and then AF changed aircraft. They split us up and the website is useless - I couldn’t even pay to have us sitting together. The support told me to sort it out at the airport. What a joke - the staff are arrogant and unhelpful and all my planning went out the window. I would not recommend anyone to fly AF if this is the way they treat their paying customers. If there is an alternative - rather take it!,,,,,
" Two short hops with this full service airline providing indeed full service during flights. Nice to see AF not only claims to be full service, but also commits to it. On both flights drink service with little snack/sandwich. Pleasant crew and easy transfer in terminal 2G at CDG.",,,,,
"  Disappointing flight. A very old Boeing 777, seat configuration 2-3-2 in Business. Champagne and wine were nothing special. Food was the worst I had on a flight, my beef was overdone,  vegetables tasteless and cheese had supermarket quality! We arrived punctually and the crew was very friendly.",,,,,
"  CDG terminal 2E, whilst spacious and clean, has a poor selection of food options, and expect to be subject to the slowest passport checks. Last call was announced before any passengers had boarded. The hidden queue had everyone standing in the air bridge for 45 minutes. Then once we finally all got seated we then sat on the gate for 1.5 hours to get an air traffic slot. No substance or apology.",,,,,
  Flew to San Jose Costa Rica via CDG. London flight departed late so made the connection through CDG challenging as had to go through security check again which was very slow. We went straight to gate and boarded the A350. Welcome on board drinks were offered before an on time departure. Menu with choices was offered - I was in row 7 and by time I was reached 2 out of 4 dishes were no longer available. Nice selection of wines. What surprised myself and my wife was the condition of the cabin - scratched surfaces and loose panels and poor for such a new aircraft. Pre landing meal offered to mewas nothing special. Wifi was not working and selection of films was limited. ,,,,,
 Very excellent cabin crew flight on time seats were comfortable. Food was good had gluten free chips which I was impressed about. WiFi was ok. Ground service was ok because the line to check-in was really long and they almost made us miss our flight but we went into a different line to prevent that.,,,,,
"  I booked a last minute through Air France from Vancouver to Amsterdam via MSP. it was a last minute decision to take this vacation for a 5 day European getaway. While my flight got cancelled because of the snow storm in MSP, I really appreciated how proactive Air France/KLM was in cancelling the flight from MSP to AMS as the cancellation came 30 hours before the flight. Getting a refund was swift and the customer service agent on the phone was polite and a real pleasure to deal with.",,,,,
"  Boarding was done efficiently with Sky Priority/Business passengers allowed on first. It was a nearly-new A350 and looked immaculate. We were greeted by enthusiastic cabin crew and shown to our seats. I have always taken the view that there is always at least one thing wrong with any business seat but not on this occasion. It was extremely well designed with an excellent screen, solid table, privacy, ample storage spaces and the ability to locate switches and power points without searching too hard. We were offered a glass of champagne, juice or water before takeoff and given a very impressively comprehensive menu. I had pre-ordered the fish and it was incredibly tasty and excellently served by the cabin crew. I chose the delicious Chablis which seems to work well at altitude. It is an overnight flight and after the meal lights were dimmed. Although it was a flat bed seat I always believed that one sleeps better if it is at a slight angle – especially as aircraft never fly exactly horizontally. Despite only a blanket and pillow I had one of the most comfortable nights ever on an aircraft. I was awoken from breakfast and shown the omelette. This, I knew, never works that well but it was still tasty and accompanied by bread and fruit. Throughout the flight the cabin crew were absolutely excellent. Every request was answered and they were friendly, funny at times, very French (of course) and a credit to the airline. I have been flying regularly since I was four years old and this was easily one of my best experiences – well up to the standard pioneered by the Middle East airlines.",,,,,
"  AF 072 flight from Paris Charles de Gaulle to LAX. US passport holders have an extra long line to weigh their baggage. The person weighing the baggage before this flight asked the passenger ahead of me in line to weigh her bags. When the bag was lower than the allowed weight, he asked her to put her shawl and jacket onto the scale. Then he shouted out ‘It is overweight, go and pay 100$ and check it in’.  I went twice through the line, after removing and throwing away some of my luggage the first time. The second time, he put a red tag and asked me to pay excess baggage. There were some people around the corner, who were in conversation with this person weighing the bags in French. They asked me for cash and told me I had to pay there to get my baggage on the plane. I gave them cash, and a woman then took me to a long line and left me with some strangers saying they will take me in with the luggage. I soon realized this was the line for Business class and I was on the wrong line. By the time I went to the baggage counter to pay for extra luggage, it was too late to check-in my bag as the time for that had lapsed. So they made me throw away most of my luggage to make it a carry-on. The next flight was only two hours away. They could have easily checked me into the next flight if they were only willing to be a little helpful.",,,,,
"  Short 1 hour flight that's perfect for people not looking for extreme budget options. Despite the relatively dated cabin interior (the plane took its first flight in 1999 according to a quick registration lookup), Air France more than makes up for it in convenience of a complimentary drink service (more than just water, but with hot and cold beverages), as well as some cookies as a snack. In addition compared to more budget options such as easyjet, AF's usage of jet bridges and the main CDG airport in Paris makes the journey overall much more convenient, as long as you don't mind spending a little more than budget offerings.",,,,,
"  I booked premium economy because I have knee problems. The seats are just OK (shell type that slides down but not built for a person over 6 feet), and the food is the same as economy, although it was the best fish I ever had on a plane. Overall, a very decent product, and the flight was on time. They lost my luggage, so I did not have winter clothing as it was summer in South Africa. I bought what I needed for €240 and Air France reimbursed me within 10 days. Overall, very satisfied and impressed by the no fuzz reimbursement.",,,,,
"  On time, in a quite comfortable seat in a duo at the back, with a wonderful clear window view, and a very informative real-time flight map. I was very lucky to book early, and paid a pittance while prices were on the floor, so good VFM. Air France is in reality operated as a budget airline, because, unlike Airasia et al, they don't sell tasty food on board. So my advice is bring a substantial picnic because, after an early lunch, you will get nothing to eat for 9 hours.  The hapless staff have nothing to offer, other than a friendly giggle or a rude dismissive shrug. Bring your own music and movies, unless you like French stuff. Don't ask cabin crew for your connection gate number, they have no interest in helping you",,,,,
" Flight was two hours late leaving Lome. At check-in, I encountered the most grim looking row of agents I'd ever seen. I understand they had to stay at work longer due to the delayed flight, but that isn't my fault and I expect some smiles and basic courtesy when checking in, particularly on a costly business class ticket. After completing check-in, I noticed that my bag tag was completely illegible because the printer was running out of ink. I returned to the check-in counter where I approached an agent who appeared to be lead agent on duty that night. I asked him in French if my bag tag can please be reprinted as it was unreadable. He started yelling at me (in French), ""Who did you see when you checked in...go to that person"". I stopped all proceedings and firmly responded, ""Why are you speaking to me like that!?"". He then told me curtly that the bag had already been sent for loading onto the aircraft. I told him that I was well aware of how the baggage system works, but I had simply asked if my bag tag could be reprinted. He continued to give me rude responses, at which point I told him to go into the system and find my baggage tag number and write it legibly on my boarding pass. I then went to the Air France station manager's office and complained. Shameful treatment of a high revenue passenger. Flights were fine. Air France lounges in Paris should stock non-alcoholic beer.  Food on Paris-Washington flight way overcooked -- dried out and unappealing appearance. Crew was very attentive, however.",,,,,
"  A bad experience with Air France. During a 9-hour flight, I waited for an hour for a glass of water. During the connection flight, they remain without sandwiches. It is incredible that Air France has such a small standard.",,,,,
"  My business class flight fell well short of a four star carrier. The reasons for this were that pre departure drink glasses were left on the central arm rest during the take off from Bangkok, I had to hold mine down during take off. The cabin crew raced through the lunch service just after take off, then after this service the cabin crew closed the window blinds and I never saw them again until the second meal service, not once did they come around asking passengers if they wanted anything. The food quality was also poor. All take off and landing announcements from the cockpit were in French, not in English. The cabin crew manager talked to French passengers but never once spoke to me once during the flight. The 2-2-2 layout is outdated and was awful but that was my fault for choosing that specific flight. The second meal service was served too late before landing, so again it was rushed. The overall experience was very poor and I won't be in a rush to try it again.",,,,,
"  I was taking a full-priced Delta ATL-JFK-LIS flight on January 10, 2023. Unfortunately my ATL-JFK flight was delayed, which would cause me to miss the connecting flight to LIS. Delta re-routed me ATL-CDG-LIS via partnership with Air France, and give me an upgrade to ""Business"" (due to the equivalent class was not available, but the ""Business"" still shows availability.) At the gate, Air France counter person insulted me: ""You have only paid $300 and want to fly Business""? I was trying to inquire if she was looking at my ATL to JFK portion of fare as I actually paid 3 times as much for my round trip. After she downgraded me and issued my ATL-CDG boarding pass, I requested the second portion (CDG-LIS), and told her I wanted to see a manager. She yelled at me: ""I am the manager!"" when I requested to see her badge (as she was wearing her badge front side inward), she replied: ""You cannot see my badge."" When I insisted, she said: ""I am deboarding you now!"" and she did knock on the keyboard to start the deboarding! At this time, a Delta counter person printed out CDG-LIS boarding pass for me. The nightmare continued in CDG when I was told I was not in Air France systems, so I cannot fly to LIS. However, the lady at CDG counter immediately escalated and resolved the situation. What a sharp contrast between the two employees from the same company! The Air France counter person in Atlanta (I still do not know her name) was rude and was all ""snappy"" and ""powerful"" when dealing with customers. The moment she said ""I am deboarding you now!"" I knew I was not talking to a normal person. While waiting to be boarded, a few other Delta passengers complained that she also charged them luggage fees - ignoring Delta policies. ""I am deboarding you now!"" was the last nail on the coffin, goodbye Air France! No one flies just for fun, we have destinations, schedules, people to meet and things to do. I can accept Delta's delay but the power trip of deboarding at Air France must be stopped!",,,,,
  The plane was spotless and very well maintained. The service was very elegant and welcoming. Food was almost as good as in a good restaurant. I felt very welcomed on board. I will fly AF in C again for sure. It was a wonderful flight.,,,,,
"  Bad experience with special meals on board, it was not possible to change them on website or app and we had normal meal but we were not able to eat anything because we are allergic to dairies. Fortunately the cabin crew tried to help with some bread and side dishes. Contacting their help 24 hours before the flight was not useful at all.",,,,,
"  Flown with Air France many times over the last 20-30 years. This flight was just a highlight about why we use Air France whenever possible. Cabin crew are very friendly, happy to have a conversation and make you feel very safe and comfortable on the flight. Short haul food is very good, and a wide range of free drinks including wine available to economy passengers is great. Luggage policies are very reasonable and it doesn’t cost much to add on extra bags or suitcases. Boarding was very efficient and both our flights were on-time. Highly recommend using AF, customer service is outstanding.",,,,,
"  HAM to CDG and return. Two short hops of 70 min each. Purchasing ticket and options via AF app was a breeze. Same for online check in. All was easy, clear and working well. At both airports I used self-serviced bag drop-off. You come to the unmanned kiosk, scan your boarding pass, then it prints your bag tag, you attach it to a bag, place the bag on the belt, scan the tag and your bag is checked. At both stations it didn’t take me more than 3 minutes with zero queuing time. At the same time queuing to normal check in desks would have taken good 20 minutes (also quite bearable if you arrive on time). My first flight was delayed by 1 hour. The delay was managed perfectly. Push notification and email on the mobile phone with new estimated boarding time and gate number, instant update of the boarding pass via app and proper announcement at the gate. Inflight information on missed and rescheduled connections was sufficient and clear. In the air they have managed to serve small snack with round if drinks (tea, coffee, soda, beer, wine). I purchased inflight internet access. The price was ok, speed was fine for browsing websites. If you need just messaging you can get a free plan for the whole duration of your flight. Cabin was clean and fresh (brand new A220) with reasonable comfort. On the way back it was HOP (regional subsidiary of AF) with older E190. Embraer fleet have no onboard internet access, but otherwise they are more comfortable with wider seats and more legroom. Service standard was identical to AF mainline with super friendly and professional crews. HOP flights use 2G terminal at CDG which is a small regional terminal located afar from the main area where all big terminals are. It requires a separate bus ride in addition to rail or bus city link, so mind it and allow extra 20 minutes if you’re leaving from there. On my flight to Paris baggage was on the belt within 30 minutes after disembarkation, when in Hamburg it took around 20 minutes to deliver bags.",,,,,
"  Customer service on the phone were both incompetent and rude. Took 4 days of being told to call back in 24h and receiving no help. Every person we spoke to at the check in desk and ticketing sales was nasty. Air France customer service at LAX is awful, one older French woman at ticketing sales was aggressive in her rudeness. My partner and I will never fly Air France again, it was such an upsetting experience considering how much we paid.",,,,,
"  Our baggage did not make the destination airport. Air France told me initially that I will get them the day after (today) - which I have been told is no longer the case, right now I already expect them tomorrow. I live in the Czech Republic and I have spent 1 month in Spain. I had to take casual and business clothes with me, as well as gym clothes. As a consequence, I do not have clothes to work tomorrow, neither for my gym session. Additionally, I have my winter jacket in the missing baggage. Being in Prague and being in winter, I can not go anywhere without it. For this reason, I am going to buy at least some business clothes and gym clothes so I can make it through the day tomorrow. Air France does not want to compensate for any of the costs involved on this as they say I have a permanent, and not a temporary address. I do not care what the policy say, this is going to cost me money and make me waste time. Being such a well known company, I trusted Air France. The whole experience of missing a baggage starts on the airport, where you are waiting for longer as your bags do not come. Then filling all the paperwork on the baggage claim desk. Afterwards, having to call the company and waiting for customer service to answer so you can get to follow up your case with disappointment to hear that it is not going to make it on the right time. Followed by wasting time shopping things that you already have. How is possible that a customer can not be compensated for such a cost, waste of time, and bad experience?",,,,,
"  I arrived to Palma de Mallorca, Spain from San Francisco, California on September 23rd, 2022. I filed my missing baggage claim on the 30th of September, 2022 and presented receipts for some of the articles I had replaced within that time frame between my arrival and my request for compensation. I was awarded the money compensation I applied for and the Air France Customer Care Assistance said they would have the money wired to my bank account over the next several weeks. I haven't seen a penny of the compensation. I called Air France Spain yesterday and the representative reopened the claim for investigation into whether or not the payment was initiated or not or if I may need to provide additional bank account information. Instead of further investigation or engagement with me, I received and email stating that the claim was handled ""correctly"" and that no further correspondence with me would be continued based on this topic. So, in the end, I have received no compensation I was told I would receive and no follow-up was even considered. Now, I will turn to contacting their customer service via social media to see if I shall get a different result. Unfortunately, according to the email, it was one representative navigating my claim this entire time with no option to speak to the person directly in charge of discharging financial compensation. Be careful with your items with Air France and I recommend keeping more of your valuables and preferred clothing in your carry on bag. I lost a lot more than I can afford to replace on my Spanish income. I would share screenshots of the email in question but it is forbidden. ",,,,,
"  The plane was nice. IFE was pretty good. The main meal was decent but the second meal was a small snack delivered in a small bag. The staff in the plane from Chicago to Paris was not very friendly. The staff in the way back from Paris to Chicago was very kind and helpful. Big difference. Lastly, my checked bag didn't make it to Chicago. The staff at Chicago didn't really want to help me. One spent a few moments trying to register a claim, gave up, handed me a card with instructions and walked away. I tried someone else about 15 minutes later, while she was not happy to help, she did complete the claim for me which I appreciated. The bag was delivered to my door, 200 miles from the airport, the next day was was great. I would fly Air France again.",,,,,
"  The Manchester to Paris segment was very average with a very poor seat pitch but for a 1hr 20 min flight I could grin and bear it. However the Paris to Bangkok segment was excellent on all counts. The service provided by Aurelie Luche was outstanding, professional and ever so efficient and friendly. The food for the 11hour and twenty minute flight was plentiful and tasty. The overall comfort of the seat was not that outstanding but I have to say that what was my first flight with Air France it certainly won't be my last. Well done to the crew, especially to Aurelie.",,,,,
"  Glitch with agent put me in regular window seat, instead of paid exit row. Although plane was near capacity, flight attendant went to great lengths to find me an aisle seat and overhead space for camera equipment. Just after take off, one of my ear buds became dislodged and fell to floor. I was not able to find it for duration of flight. After everyone else deplaned, I searched to no avail, and was about to quit the search. 3 flight attendants joined the search, and one of them found missing ear bud 4 rows behind my row. The pair retails for $250! I thanked her profusely, and offered to send her a photo gift. I hope she replies. This flight crew was very professional, positive and engaging.",,,,,
"  Wonderful flight. Extremely professional crew and delicious food. I didn't love the seat and found it a bit narrow compared to others, but didn't detract from the experience. Would recommend.",,,,,
" A good return trip to PUJ in the Caribbean with AF from CDG. They have a very solid product. Good quality food -two services - and even champagne in economy which is a great classy touch. Cabin crew were immaculately presented on both legs and friendly and highly professional. Additional drinks on demand. IFE is not to my taste but I am not a big user of IFE. If there was any fault it would be the numerous announcements in English, French and Spanish which was a bit much. Also lights a bit bright at other times. Baggage handling and check in fine on both legs. A good solid product from a classic legacy carrier.",,,,,
"  Air France business class lounge in Zanzibar is non-existent! Air France in Zanzibar does not have a contract for its passengers to use the Business Class lounge so even if you have paid for a business class ticket, to use the lounge in Zanzibar airport, you will be told to pay USD $30. Air France knows that their business class passengers will not be able to use the lounge and they make sure not to advise passengers. You will make the discovery when you attempt to enter the lounge. When I contacted Air France for a refund, they told me that they are not responsible for business lounges outside of France! That’s called collecting money under false pretences!  I went online to request my gluten-free meal. I called Air France twice to confirm that the meals had been ordered. However, on the 8 hour flight from Paris to Miami, Air France forgot to provide a gluten free meal. So I enjoyed nuts and juices for the 8-hour flight. When I contacted Air France, they told me that they were sorry. No compensation for their error. The moral of the story - if you need a gluten-free meal in business class, take your meal on board with you! That's after you pay the business class fare of $3200!",,,,,
 Nice short trip on time. We were even served a sandwich and drink on a 45 min flight. Outstanding: due to train delay I arrived at airport just 40 min before flight. Pulled me through first and even baggage arrived.,,,,,
"  Our flight in June 2022 was already late, and once in the plane and already moving on the ground in order to take-off, the crew detected a fuel leak,o we had to ""pass by technical control"", while remaining in the plane. After having waited 1 hour in the aircraft with an obviously upset crew, they finally told us that this aircraft could not fly and that we have to wait in the airport for another aircraft to continue our journey. After waiting 2 hours in a very limited area, Air France announces that we can eventually not depart ""as we will land in Pointe-à-Pitre too late because there is a curfew"". So we have to move in the main lobby to pre-check-in for the next day, but we have to wait again as they don't know from which airport in Paris we have to leave the following day. So the desk remains closed. It's already been 5 hours since the trouble started, and at last they provide us with a bottle of water. Nothing before. Everyone is getting very upset with the situation and waiting for Air France to organize our unexpected night in Paris, to finally hear : ""We will not take care of your accomodation and transportation, please make your own plans, we will reimburse you afterwards"". The flight was in June, nothing has been reimbursed so far, and not even my request has been answered by October. ",,,,,
"  Air France Business Class Mauritius to Paris Boeing 777. Recent seats and good food but got the impression that the cabin crew forgot me. Meal selection was limited, forgot to serve me dessert. When asked it was served on the table without table cloth without any napkin. When asking for a napkin, I was given a large table cloth. For breakfast had to use the call button a few times to get an orange juice and another tea. Travelling is not only about cabin product seats and meals, you need to feel welcomed and pampered. This was not the case for Air France crew on this flight.",,,,,
  One of the most comfortable Premium Economy seats. Brand new aircraft. Flights on time both outbound and inbound. Onboard staff very courteous and professional. Onboard Wi-Fi probably the best connection I have experienced in the air. The only downsize is the food. So far the worse even compared to an average economy class. Food was disappointing. If not for the food I would have voted 10/10.,,,,,
"  I will never fly Air France again and urge you not to if you have a choice. For reference, I previously worked for an airline, so I am very familiar with flying. First, for our first short flight our Viking Cruise got us to the airport 4 hours early (this was not Air France's fault), but Air France didn't open their ticket counter for another two plus hours, so we couldn't check in and had to sit with our bags in ticketing for a long time. On the long leg of our trip, the 8.5 hour flight, we didn't leave until about 30 minutes late (we were sitting on the plane) and then they didn't tell us until we'd already taken off that we wouldn't have internet for the flight. I did not pay 5k for my seat to not be able to contact my pet sitter or download a book for 9 hours. The also didn't have internet on a short leg on our way to Barcelona.",,,,,
"  We got to CDG airport 3 hours before departure, and we had to run to catch the flight. Long lines, some counters were closed while the ground staff was chatting, no sense of urgency from anyone. The supervisor was less helpful than the others. When we landed at LAX, we didn't find our luggage, and AF personnel had no idea of where it was. It was left in front of the house door the following day without even ringing the bell. We found the bag broken and unrepairable and AF only reimbursed us for 15% of the value for a new bag, with no explanation. ",,,,,
"  They have cancelled the flight 15 minutes before departure. They have booked me another flight without asking about my preferences at >than 48 h after the original one. After spending a lot of time listening to their music while waiting for someone to pick up the phone in Customer Care, they hung up the phone in the middle of my question without providing useful information. They seemed very bothered by the fact that I could have used some help.",,,,,
"  We (a family of 4) made a trip to Hamburg in early July and had a stop in Paris. Our first flight had a 2 1/2 hour delay so we couldn’t catch our connection flight. In Paris we spend over 2 hours to find someone feeling responsible for getting us on a new flight. On one of the biggest International Airports in Europe! After a delay of 6 hours we finally arrived in Hamburg, where we recognized that all our 5 Baggage pieces went missing. We immediately made an AHL Report and headed to our Vacation home without any clothes. We made necessity purchases over the 17 day vacation because our baggage still was nowhere to be found. I made a Claim on the Air France Website for those necessity purchases on day 14 of the vacation. After 21 days I made a claim for lost baggage because the baggage still hasn’t arrived. After 28 days 3 of 5 baggages arrived at our home. The remaining 2 haven’t arrived now for over 3 months. The customer Support took forever to just answer and asking simple questions about data that already has been send over and hasn’t paid any compensation yet. They write mails in which they said you have been on a totally wrong flight on a wrong date. For example they wrote we have been on a flight from Paris to Havana on October 11. Somehow they even closed the claim for the missing baggage although 2 pieces are still missing and on the date of the claim 3 pieces have been already missing for over 21 days. Their Website states that after 21 days you’re baggage is supposed to be lost and you are qualified for a compensation.  Never again Air France, worst experience ever.",,,,,
"  I had tried to upgrade from economy to premium economy online, but there was no availability. When I was already seating while the plane was about to leave, the flight attendant came to ask if I still wanted to move to premium economy and pay with my miles. This was a pleasant surprise and I enjoyed the extra space on this long night flight. The premium economy seat was comfortable and the service friendly.",,,,,
" An unreliable company, with careless customer service. My flight was permanently further delayed with nonsense announcements, culminating when Air France App claimed at 6h07 pm the flight was scheduled to leave at 5h15pm (see picture)! We finally left with 2h delay (for a 1h flight). No WiFi on board contrary to what was advertised before the flight and even on board. The cabin crew was unapologetic. No way to work or inform business partners at MPL of my scheduled arrival time. In-flight ""business"" meal consisted of nuts, one cookie, and a drink. I don't see the difference with ""economy"". Finally arrived starved, late, having lost my business day. Despite Platinum loyalty status and flying business class, all this was considered not worth any compensation by AF customer service. I regret not having traveled by train.",,,,,
"  I was very fortunate to fly business with Air France, first Toronto to Paris, after being bumped by WestJet, and taking a flight a few hours later, which was excellent. Then even better was my flight Paris to Vancouver, with the lovely and very efficient flight attendant. I felt her performance alone deserved attention for how special it was. The food and wine was extraordinary, no request was too much, and I enjoyed getting to try to converse in French. I don’t write a lot of reviews, and I usually travel Star Alliance, but for Air France, I’ll gladly make exceptions going forward! I will see Air France in business again in April, to Paris and Lisbon, I cant wait! ",,,,,
"  Very Smooth flight. Seat space is very comfortable for economy, 81 cm much more than others offer. Good entertaining and nice crew. Free champagne and a nice dinner with several courses free wines and a pre landing snack. Only the snack was bad and only dry bread. Delay one hour but arrived on time. Would fly Air France again.",,,,,
" New York to Stuttgart via Paris. I had a bad experience, on my flight from New York to Paris. Firstly everything was so uncoordinated, the flight got delayed, even the staff from the plane wasn’t in yet even though the boarding would be in 5 minutes. While we was flying there were many inconveniences. First the AC was so cold that I froze the whole time, secondly we flew at night (0:30) and people wanted to sleep but the lights from the airplane were fully on. It was a longer flight but we didn’t receive much to eat and when they came by with water, tea, coffee they didn’t asked me, just a few passengers.",,,,,
" We had the best flight attendants. They were lovely. Very attentive to the passengers, very friendly. We were on flight 338 on September 29 leaving Paris to Seattle at 14:15.",,,,,
" London to Dubai via Paris. After being unable to make my journey and trying to rebook my ticket the customer service has been utterly terrible. They wouldn't offer a refund, instead offered to rebook and call back once the fees were calculated within 48hrs. This never happened, and when trying to check my flight details on the app and found there was nothing there - I called them back and was told my £825 ticket was cancelled. I have spent many days talking to various people over the phone having no clue, but at the same time scared to summon one of their supervisors who are always 'in a meeting' - it's been a month now. They now refuse to do anything about my tickets, constantly hanging up without offering any resolve, the outsourced call centre obviously doesn't care for the reputation of the Airline. I have never had this bad customer service with any airline regarding cancellations and rebooking/changing of a flight and I've been travelling to medical conferences and meetings for 50+ years. Unless you really have to, I would avoid this airline like the plague (I only took this airline based on my daughter's word and recent travel), they do not care for your custom, they don't even have any Air-France staff at the check-in desks in Heathrow.",,,,,
"  Flights cancelled at short notice, no rebooking options, no compensation. I had to buy a new ticket and it took them over 2 months to refund the previous one. Aircrafts were fine, service was standard for long haul. 3 pieces of luggage delayed for 75 days, no information from their customer service, hard to reach and rude. Worst experience with an airline, they'll never see me again.",,,,,
"  Air France has been improving recently even if I already enjoyed flying this Airline,. CDG could be a small downside for a few people but I've always loved it, even though everything might take a few more minutes, I have always like it because it's beautiful!",,,,,
"  The airline sold me a ticket, changing in Paris, but left nowhere near enough time to get through security and run across the airport. It was pretty humiliating, and the staff were incredibly rude. When I complained about it, the customer service lady threatened to cancel my return ticket and actually dismissed me with a 'dusting off her hands' motion. They have completely ignored my request for a refund (it left me £233 out of pocket and with a ruined trip. It took all day just to get home).",,,,,
"  My original flight had mechanical problems while in flight, so we diverted to Milan and endured hours of delay in getting to our final destination of New York-JFK. It was an awful ordeal. I submitted a delay compensation request back in January, and they finally approved it in September (more than 8 months to process!), but only for one of the two passengers in the reservation. I supplied them with all of the documentation they requested for both passengers. They have been unfriendly and unhelpful in getting to this point, and now after eight months of waiting, they are making me still fight them for the proper compensation amount. All I'm asking is that they follow the standard regulations set forth by the European Union. Nothing more, nothing less. ",,,,,
"  Overall, a pleasant flight. The mini croissant served on the E190 was tasty. As for the food on the A350, it was satisfying enough but was not up to my expectations. Flight attendants were smiling.",,,,,
" Excellent service at Bengaluru. Due to the short time in b/w transfers one bag did not arrive. However Air France had already sent a list of missing baggage and they informed us whilst we were at the luggage carousel, this saving us time. They tracked where our baggage was and sent it on the next flight. It arrived safely. Very helpful staff at Bengaluru who helped us when we were tired and stressed. Thank you Air France! Re food though it's a different review as the quality was poor, food passed off as Indian, really wasn't food any Indian would eat!",,,,,
" Delayed baggage, and even longer delays (3 days!) in shipping it to me. Air France has scheduled far too short a connection time in Paris for its flights from West Africa (Guinea and Central African Republic), and given the change in terminal and slow security at CDG, I always end up having to run in order to make the final call for my London flight - very stressful. Air France themselves have the same problem - the last time I flew, my bag also missed the connection, and arrived in London three hours after me. That's when things really went downhill. Despite the fact that I live only two hours drive from Heathrow, it took Air France 3 days to ship my bag to me. I can order something on Amazon by midday and have it delivered the same day, but Air France takes 3 days to ship to an address two hours drive away. The final cherry on the cake: arrogant, indifferent customer service. When I called to complain about all of this and asked for a manager, the operator initially refused to let me talk to a manager, saying this was just about a bag. When I insisted, he said all of the managers were in a meeting, but he refused to get a manager to call me back - he said I would have to ring again and try to catch them when they're available! I will instead now vote with my feet, and stop using Air France for my flights to West Africa. Terrible airline.",,,,,
" Excellent flight from Paris to Montréal, I wouldn't have recommended Air France 6 or 7 years ago, but this airline is really improving. The cabin crew was pleasing and careful, the flight landed earlier than announced and the food was pretty good for an economy class. The only negative point is that Paris CDG is really disorganized, it is probably one of the worst airports I've had experienced with Amsterdam AMS in Europe. I really hope that it will improve within the next years.",,,,,
"  My flight from Zurich to Paris was an hour late.  My return flight experience was worse: I paid for a Siège Plus (11D) with extra legroom. However, there were no such seats (no emergency exit seats) on the Embraer 170. I now have to spend time filing an online claim for a reimbursement. My baggage was not delivered in Zurich. This is not the first time my bags have been lost by Air France even in a tiny terminal like 2G in Paris.  The bag finally arrived at Zurich airport this morning, one and a half days late. The local transporter never contacted me to schedule delivery. I had to call AF and insist on getting the local transporter's telephone number. I was told the bag was on its way, despite the fact that nobody had called me to check if I was home. I was told it would be with me between 3 and 5 p.m. No bag arrived. I then called the transporter again, who checked and said the driver claimed I was not at home. Hello! I had stayed at home the entire day. I did not even take a shower in case the driver came with my bag at exactly that time. This was a blatant lie by the driver. I then insisted that they make a delivery and I now have another two interval I need to block in the evening. In the best case scenario, I will have spent my entire day waiting at home for a bag. Between AF and the useless local transporter, I have wasted two days. Is this how AF treats its passengers? Is a Flying Blue Gold member impressed by this experience? I am very frustrated by the utter lack of professionalism from start to finish. ",,,,,
"  I must say that I am impressed by the Air France flight crew. I recently flew from NY to Bangalore with a connection in Paris with my wife and 12 month old son.  It was exactly what you would expect it to be. A nightmare! We had everything planned (my wife did I just follow orders) from the flight time, connection, food, sleep etc so that our child could have as smooth as a trip as possible. From NY to Paris we we golden. Smooth as silk. We took off he ate and slept. We landed and had some trouble figuring things out but we managed. Once we got on the plane for our Paris to Bangalore slight the nightmare began. He started screaming at the top of his lungs before the flight took off. Our plan for entertainment was lost during transport (ipad with pre downloaded 5hrs Cocomelon). He was rejecting all toys and foods. The lady behind us asked my wife "" Is he going to be like that the whole flight?"" After some back and forth with the other passenger, ourselves and the flight crew we took off. It was a 10hr flight and he cried for 9 of them. It was an out of body experience. Our son has never been so miserable. I dont know if it was sleep deprivation or his ears were bothering him but he was inconsolable. Our friend behind us, to her credit, along with the other passengers did not add fuel to the fire. The only bright spot was the flight crew. Which is the reason for the review. I have to give credit where credit is due. They were simply amazing. Very empathetic and supportive. Asking us if we needed any support on multiple occasions and it wasn't just one of them it was all of them. Providing us with food and supplies that I didn't even know was available. BTW did you know that there are children's eye covers? I found that interesting and don't know why. Anyway if it wasn't for our air heroes my wife and I would be needing immediate psychiatric therapy. We all know how difficult that is to get now and days. My salute to the air crew that day. You saved us and we are truly grateful. We will remember this day for a long time not only because of the difficulties we had with our son but for the care and help we received from the crew",,,,,
"  This was a booking with KLM for two passengers made and paid by myself but one passenger cancelled. I was promised a refund against a fee. The refund was never made. I asked various Air France employees if there was anything I could do to solve the situation.  It seems to me that niceties in the cabin are cheap to get, and anyway, those are paid for. When real issues arise, Air France is incapable of solving them, and, indeed, does not care to do so. ",,,,,
"  I would like to say that the airline and cabin crew were absolutely brilliant. They were very attentive and in hand if we needed them. The inflight food was delicious and tasty, not bland like other airlines. We pre-paid for our seats and we’re very pleased with the extra leg room outbound and the Solo seats coming home. I would like to thank all the staff from check in until when we landed. So professional and quick so the queues were small and manageable. Air France made our holiday more amazing by delivering such a wonderful experience. Thank You.",,,,,
"  Outstanding service. I have travelled from OTP to JFK via CDG and return in business class. A great experience from the lounge, food, beverages to the comfort of the seat. On the return segment JFK -CDG I was upgraded in La Premiere due to my Platinum Ultimate status. The onboard service was state of the art. The champagne the best I have ever tasted. The FAs and the pursers attitude and service flow less. Looking forward to my next trip with AF.",,,,,
  They stop passengers at security to weigh their carry-on luggage. They weigh both bags and if both bags are even 1KG over their 12 KG weight limit they make you walk back to the Air France check-in area to spend 110 euros and 25 minutes to check one bag (not both bags even though they were both weighed together). This would make sense if the luggage was oversized and didn’t fit in the overhead bins but our small luggage was overweight was because we travel with large books. ,,,,,
"  I booked a flight for an Air France / Virgin Atlantic flight from Orlando to Beirut. Once I landed in Beirut airport I notice I'm missing one checked bag so I reached out to the missing luggage office and file claim. 2 days later I got update by email that my bag was found, and it will be forwarded to Beirut. I contacted airport for my bag, and they said my bag did not arrive. 2 days later suddenly the claim I filed in the airport was closed and when I contacted customer service, they didn't know how the claim was closed or who closed it. I filed online claim again, since then I have been calling customer service every day about my luggage with no updates. Nobody could explain how my first claim was closed and keep saying no update on my luggage. I filed claim for necessary purchase but I didn't get any reimbursement, then after 21 days filed claim for lost luggage. I started calling air France every day, I got to speak with supervisor who made clear your bag was lost and there is no way for passenger to talk to claim department unless they call you. I asked how long it takes to get my reimbursement, he said, we have long queue and this might take several months. So they lost my bag with promise they will reimburse me when they decide to do with no timeframe. ",,,,,
"  We were able to fit everything into carry on luggage, which was helpful, especially outbound. On the return flight our bags were spot checked and found to be overweight so we had to get out of the line for passport control, check the bags, then get back into the passport line. This was frustrating, but since we had left a ridiculous amount of time to make the flight we didn't actually have a problem. In addition, the employees marshaling the passport lines were very heads-up and were moving people to fill gaps in the line. They also appeared responsive to pleas about flights departing soon, including those in English. We were of course pretty worried about whether our bags would vaporize on the way to JFK but fortunately everything showed up and was undamaged. All of this means we were very fortunate, since we were flying midsummer when all of the horror stories were happening and  we didn't have to deal with AF ground service, which in our experience has never been terrible but never better than OK, either.  The in flight experience was fine, although AF is one airline where it pays to fly Premium Economy. We flew regular Economy because of the size of our group, and the service was less. Cabin staff very pleasant as usual but not very visible apart from meal service. Much more attentive the further forward you go, which is not a very passenger-centric strategy. The aircraft wasn't new but had been refreshed. IFE worked and had lots of options. Outbound flight took off late but landed almost on time, return flight was on time. In Premium Economy or Business Class Air France an excellent airline, but in Economy it's a little disappointing. AF could learn a lot from Delta, which provides pretty good service throughout the cabin, or even from United, which is mediocre front to back. Most of my international travel is to France, and most of that is on Air France. This is unlikely to change. Still, I live in hope that Air France ups its game on the service front.",,,,,
"  Shame on Air France for its disgraceful performance and for doing nothing thus far to settle a claim for clothes and incidentals I had to buy after my luggage was delayed last December  when returning from Guinea to Washington DC in business class. I must have now called Air France a dozen times to find out the status of my claim. Each time, I get bounced around from one agent to another, each of whom appears completely unable to provide any help whatsoever. One agent today told me that the only way to communicate with AF is via social media and suggested I try Twitter and Facebook. I've already tried both of those months ago and never have had any response. I've now escalated the matter with my firm and with AMEX which did the booking as my company's corporate travel partner. Shame on Air France. I've never encountered such incompetence.",,,,,
"  We just had a return flight scheduled via Air France on August 1st. We arrived 2.5 hours early to Charles de Gaulle but the bag drop-off took 1 hour then we were stopped for having carry-on bags too large at security and had to return to check the carry-ons, after this, we had 50 minutes until departure but security machine broke and caused abnormal security delays of an hour. We missed the flight. It then took 2 hours of waiting at Air France ticketing to learn the next flight would be 6 days away (with us having NO luggage). We opt for another flight on a different airline and airport but now to get our bags ... another 5 hours of waiting to get our 2 carry-on bags. We are told to return in the morning to pick up our other 2 large checked bags that had been pulled from the plane. We come back to CDG, wait 1.5 hours in a 5 person line to find out that those bags cannot be accessed, and they have to send them across the ocean and deliver to our home address. Unbelievable service from Air France. No apologies from anyone or care for the extraordinary mess of lines! One bag has been found but the other is untraceable.",,,,,
"  No issues. Decent meal. Good entertainment. The domestic flights inside of Greenland don’t have any food or entertainment, but this one long haul route does. Would fly again.",,,,,
"  First of they attributed to me and my husband 2 seat, each one at the opposite of the plane. We had to wait plenty of time for luggage drop. I am traveling all over the world with my camera and lenses in my backpack and a trolley containing all important stuff like medicines and so. Especially in these times when luggage are more than sometimes lost. Today was the first time they ask money to send my trolley.... I really hope it will land with me. Also the staff even didn't try to help or to be comprehensive. And of course there was no responsible person to talk to. And no time was left. So we had to pay. I think it is unacceptable. Even the Stewardess was not a nice person. When the company is not positive, everything is bad. I will never travel with them again. ",,,,,
"  I booked my ticket at Air Greenland's website in Dec 2019 for a planned holiday in Sept 2020. Small planes and infrequent flights, thought I'd better book early. So much has happened since then with Covid. I'm trying to refund or rebook this expensive ticket - they point-blank refused. First they said they were not processing any ticket changed dated after 31 Aug, and asked me to contact them again in mid Aug. Now they said since my ticket was not bought after Apr 2020, they will not rebook/refund! I am not even allowed in Denmark, how am I supposed to take the flights? Most airlines offer free refund or rebooking of international flight tickets. Not Air Greenland!",,,,,
"  Nuuk to Copenhagen. Just a short comment. Way too expensive, for obviously no other reason but pure arrogance because they are the only company flying into or out of Greenland and they think they can do whatever they want. Nonstop technical errors, and constant danger of missing other flights because of them. If there were ANY other options to fly in or out of Greenland i would choose it over Air Greenland. I feel robbed and furious every time i have to give them my money.",,,,,
  Copenhagen to Maniitsoq. One of the worst airlines. Very bad customer service both on board and at the airports. They don't take of you or your luggage and they don't take responsibility for anything - it is always the others responsibility.,,,,,
" Flew Air Greenland from Copenhagen to Ilulissat via Kangerlussuaq. Way too expensive in relation to the journey length. Long queue on check-in at Copenhagen Airport. Seems to lack any service minded and professional customer service skills. Using terminal 3 for check-in would be preferable than terminal 2. The A330 was old and indeed outdated, a new interior or replacement of the transatlantic aircraft is needed. There is no Wi-Fi onboard, quality of the food was bad, very poor and old in-flight entertainment. 1 movie was shown and a few playlists were on, there were problems with their entertainment system, it to be reset some times before it worked. There is a very off-hand attitude among the staff, not least on board the transatlantic flight. Seriously, they don't seem to care about their customers! Though the short flight on the small Dash 8, was better. Arriving Copenhagen Airport, the waiting time for your luggage can be very long, this can take as long as up to 1 hour after arrival. Overall I would not fly this airline again if there was other alternatives.",,,,,
"  Copenhagen to Kangerlussuaq. I purchased a Business Class ticket over 9 months in advance. It was confirmed and I was assigned a seat. I even got Boarding Passes the day before the flight for my wife and I. But on the day of the flight I was told I had no seat while my wife did. Air Greenland overbooked and to solve the problem they did not select someone who bought last, but the one who paid more. Odd and unique logic as the person who bumped me bought a Flexible ticket because there were no Restricted Tickets left. So the highest bidder gets the seat. I had my Travel agent inquire as to whether I would be bumped again on the return and she got no reply. I was not bumped as the person who got my seat returned on a private jet as he met a friend on his travels. He had purchased long after me and had no seat assignments. Kangerlussuaq airport is small, overcrowded and chaotic. You get to go downstairs to get your bags and drag them back upstairs.",,,,,
"Flew Copenhagen to Maniitsoq via Kangerlussuaq. Air Greenland appears to be an airline of two parts: long range A330 to Denmark and Dash 8s on internal flights plus helicopters. A hot meal was served on the long flights with soft drinks, beer and wine and the outward flight was comfortable enough. The Dash 8 was awaiting our arrival for its 40 minute flight. On the return Maniitsoq airport only opened at noon due to weather problems [not uncommon] and they tried to combine two flights, but we were over-weight, so 8 passengers had to be left behind, for 2 days for the next flight. We were lucky and flew but were about 2 hours arriving for the Copenhagen flight. However it was running late already, they held it for a further 20 minutes so we could make the connection. So a satisfactory experience, and one appreciated the hostile environment for flying.",,,,,
Me and my wife flew up from Copenhagen to Kangerlussuaq and back again. The food was perfect. The seats where okay but you couldn't lower it to a bed. There was no AVOD system but the pre selected movies were great directly from the cinema.,,,,,
I flew to Kangerlussuaq (A330) a couple days later to Nuuk (Dash7) then Ilulissat- Kangerlussuaq-Copenhagen (Dash7 + A330). The flights were pleasant on time and meals onboard were delicious Greenlandic products (fish shrimp). Considering Air Greenland has more or less a monopoly on travel to/in Greenland the service was excellent. On the Kangerlussuaq-Nuuk leg we turned back 3 minutes before landing in Nuuk due to sudden fog upon landing in Kangerlussuaq we were given lunch vouchers worth 100 DKK and clear information on when we could attempt to fly again. Visitors must keep in mind that weather is very erratic and unpredicatable in Greenland so you need to factor possible delays not under the control of the airline. The safety card in the seat pocket had interesting information on how to use the seat upholstery to keep your feet warm in case of an emergency landing in arctic weather most unusual !,,,,,
"Copenhagen - Sønderstrømfjord - Asiaat and return. Airbus A330-200 very comfortable. Everyone on economy had their own 7"" LCD Screen variety of film rather poor. The food was excellent! The DASH7 to Asiaat was rather cramped and noisy and we only got two cookies and a glass of juice / Coffee. But what can you expect for a 45 min flight?",,,,,
I used Air Greenland on a trip from Copenhagen to Kangerlussuaq on to Aasiaat Ummanaq Ilulissat then back to Kangerlussuaq and Copenhagen. The flights from Copenhagen to Kangerlussuaq and return were on modern A330s. I flew business class which was excellent for an average flight time of 4.5 hours. The transatlantic flights were smooth crew efficient and friendly seats comfortable and equipped with video monitors and the aircraft clean. Domestic flights were flown on Dash 7 rather old but clean and a reliable aircraft. All flights on time. On the downside any flight that has an intermediate stopover requires one to deplane and wait in the boarding lounge. At markedly cold temperatures walking on the tarmac to the terminal is not necessarily the most enjoyable experience. Overall though this is a very good airline and I do not hesitate recommending them.,,,,,

"I used Air Greenland beginning of August 2006 from Copenhagen to Narsarsuaq together with a group of 30 spanish people for tourism. Our fly was delayed at first 24h due to ""weather conditions"" and then was re-scheduled 3 days after. This obviously affected our planned journey within Greenland. The information received from Air Greenland was poor and inconsistent; even though they admitted the cancellation was due to a failure in the aircraft they said this was beyond the control of Air Greenland. Who is supposed to take care of Air Greenland's aircrafts but them? At the end there was no compensation and 3 days lost. They do not even have a claiming form. This is an example of how a monopolistic business can reduce client's service.",,,,,
Flew Air Greenland on a business trip from Copenhagen to Kangerlussuaq. The best part of the flight was getting to fly on that awesome red beauty of theirs. The service was good. Nothing spectacular. Friendly crew and there if you need something. The food was okay. I've had much better on other airlines (Air France Lufthansa SAS) but Air Greenland is the only airline that flies this route so I can't complain too much. The price of the flight was kind of expensive for a 4.5-5 hour flight (it cost around 800Euro) - but other than that left on time arrived 30 minutes early friendly crew onboard and on the ground and wonderful scenery on approach to Sondre Stromfjord. Overall good experience. Will definitely fly with them again.,,,,,
"I used Greenlandair (now Air Greenland) on the Kangerlussuaq to Copenhagen route twice. The flight was nice and on time. The Boeing 757-200 (which will now be changed to an Airbus A330 model) was very clean. I've also taken SAS Scandinavian Airlines on this flight and Air Greenland had a more ""traditional"" feeling to it probably because it is Greenlandic. I will definitely use them again on this route.",,,,,
"  Icelandair has got to be the worst airline ever! First their kiosks weren’t working and I took for ever to check our bags because they wouldn’t print our boarding passes. Then on plane there was a may functioning light and we had to deboard, waited for over an hour for them to tell us the flight is canceled. They neglected to tell us where to get our bags and their customer Services were totally useless. They gave us a 200 dollar voucher they didn’t cover our families room making us waste money. We just came back to fly another flight and they just pushed it back another hour. There is no one manning Icelandair in the airport and is a disgrace of an airline.",,,,,
"  Reykjavik to Akureyri. I have never been on a friendlier serviced aircraft than this! Absolutely wonderful flight, only 35 minutes, and quite a unique experience on a propeller plane. Absolutely love the onboard ""travel journal"" where you can read other passengers adventures and write your own in, very sweet! Would love to fly with them again next time I'm in Iceland!",,,,,
  Egilsstadir to Reykjavík. Check in was a breeze. Waiting area very clean. Boarding was very easy just showing ticket and photo ID. It was a 45 minute flight. They served tea or coffee with a chocolate. I really enjoyed the flight as I did not want to travel by road again. I will fly them again.,,,,,
"  Had one of the worst experiences being a frequent flyer. Our flight from Bangkok arrived 20 minutes prior to the expected time. Collected our baggage, went through customs and other formalities just to reach the Domestic Air India counter to find out that our flight was delayed departure by 2 hours and the airport staff went let us go to the Departure Gates area as our Boarding procedure was pushed coz of the delay too. Me along with my wife and 2 kids had to unwillingly wait at the International exit where none of the few charging sockets were working and the sitting are was so crowded that restless passengers had to sleep on the floors (I'm sure many others would agree to seeing this happen) Spent 3 hours sitting on the seats with eyes full of sleep and tiredness. I assume that airlines are treating passengers according to their places of arrival and dominate passengers coz of the routes being less favorite by Delaying flights unnecessary etc. I'm shocked how a key player like Air india act so unprofessionally after being in business for a very long time. Disappointed to the core.",,,,,
"  Bad treatment, took Air India flt no. 129 on 15th July 5.45 am departure, what I experienced was not expected from Air India. After breakfast, we had to ask for a cup of tea, which very conveniently got over just before our front row, the Steward too conveniently did turn up. Finally I had to request staff who in turn was kind enough to provide us tea, even though she was not in charge of the muddle row. It didn't end here, the same thing he repeated the same after the afternoon meals, when I requested him he said tea is over and will get it, he didn't turn up with tea till end. This type of treatment is not expected from Air India, it is also very strange that we in the middle row is served meals at the end, by this time the both the other rows are almost done with their meals, Air India is going from bad to worst, no value for money, AI is not charging anything less, than other Airlines, then why such nasty treatment to their own countrymen",,,,,
  Requested a gluten free meal and was given a regular meal. I even double checked at check in about my request and although the staff couldn’t see my request was told it will be fine which it wasn’t.,,,,,
" Worst planes I have ever been in while taking an international flight. I took same flight from Melbourne to Delhi with in a span of two weeks and both times flight was same. Flight entertainment didn't work both times even though it is direct flight for 12.5hours, Mobile charging USB plugs didn't work and Flight crew went to sleep after serving breakfast. You can imagine the torture of sitting on tiny seat with no entertainment, no mobile phone and no service. When I raised concern with customer care, they first promised to fix it by giving me 200 FFF points but then I said I prefer better service and I am happy to donate my points, then they offered me 25% of of the total flights I took. But no, nothing was given. I sent emails twice to see progress but after 3 months, nothing has been done. I paid almost double coz it was a direct flight and both times it was torture.",,,,,
" I have been flying for the past 21 years and never have I seen such a poorly conditioned International flight. Your flight was disgusting and dirty. The toilet situation was horrendous and had a disgusting smell all the time. Also, your entertainment service was not available for the entire 15 hr flight. The meals were exceptionally nasty and tasteless. It is such a shame to represent India with this kind of flight. The only part I was satisfied with was the service from one of your staff. She was kind and nice to everyone. I am not writing this review with the hope that you will address all your flight issues but at least I want you to acknowledge the horrible service you are providing.",,,,,
" Sometime around 2017 I got the patriotism bug. After avoiding Air India like a plague for years, I decided to travel with Air India. Well the first time from SFO-CCU and back wasn’t bad. However, as the years have progressed, Air India has gotten progressively worse. Yes, Air India seems to have gotten worse after the takeover of Tata. Without recounting every horror story that I have about Air India, I will simply, and briefly share my experience with Air India flying back from CCU to EWR on June 30, 2023. As we got to the airport I was prepared for the rudeness. The staff members of Indigo, Spice, etc., seemed to be treating their customers in a friendly manner, however, Air India staff seemed just sad, and pathetic. So then we get on our flight from CCU to DEL. The food is inedible, the AC doesn’t seem to be working, and the flight attendants were missing for the rest of the flight. Okay, so then we get to Delhi. Now, I don’t if it’s just an attitude issue, perhaps something cultural, in Delhi, or Air India. But Air India staff there are not only rude but also just pathetically incompetent. Somehow, I got called in for “a secondary inspection.” Apparently having a Zippo (without fuel) is not allowed by CISF. Anyway, so after being harassed by them, I get back to the gate and the Air India staff has somehow lost my boarding pass, which they had kept when I went to see the CISF people. Instead of apologizing and reissuing a pass two Air India staff kept arguing with me that they don’t have my boarding pass. Finally, they find it. Again no apology. So, I being exhausted, get on the flight. This time I had made sure to get on the flight early, since on my way to Kolkata, they could not find a space for my cabin luggage so I had to store them in two different overhead bins. So I was relieved when I saw the overhead bins empty (I had booked extra legroom seats). However, the moment I start putting my luggage, an anxious flight attendant runs towards me and starts scolding me. I inform her that it was my seat and I will keep my luggage there. She proceeds to tell me that the overhead bin is reserved for “oversized baggage.” So at this point, I lose my cool. So, let me understand this, instead of enforcing the rule regarding baggage size and weight, like a normal airline, Air India has decided to punish passengers who ARE following the rule. Anyway I told the flight attendant that I will be keeping my bag where it is and that’s that. She mumbled something about people brining 4 bags instead of 2. Whatever! However, somehow this flight attendant seemed to be the one serving my seat for the whole 14 hour flight. As expected the in-flight entertainment system did not work. Funnily the guy seating beside me had his remote literally torn off from his seat. However, I regret eating the pathetic food that Air India provided. I kid you not, the salad they gave was literally rotten. Didn’t they know that Mayonnaise rots very easily, and DOES NOT need to be warmed up? What was worse than the food was that the same flight attendant kept pushing my buttons throughout the flight. At some point, like a good passenger I had kept my trash ready to be given back to the attendant after dinner. However, when the attendant came, she seemed agitated, gestured toward the front of the flight, and said “You can throw it in.",,,,,
"  My flight was supposed to depart New Delhi at 2300hrs. It was first delayed until 0200hrs on the following day. Closer to the time, they delayed it further to 0500hrs. No reason provided. I am still at the airport in New Delhi. Do not know if they will delay it, most disappointed with this supposedly new era of Air India. In May 23 also travelled in this airline when we found the food on board was inedible and the inflight entertainment system was not working. It's was on the premium sector of London to New Delhi.",,,,,
"  I took this early morning flight which at the time of booking was a pretty good reasonable rate. The online check in was done smoothly and at the airport the bag drop was also done well and swiftly. Boarding also started well on time and was surprised to note that this was a full flight at such an odd hour and the aircraft type was the bigger A321 for this sector. I had noticed that there was a passenger who was having slight difficulty but the crew was able to talk to her make her calm which was a good thing to see. Also surprisingly on this flight sector I had noticed that there were snacks being offered on this flight as previously on this sector they used to give only a sandwich. I had opted for the non veg refreshments which consisted of pasta with chicken along with a nice chocolate cake for dessert and the food quality was pretty good. Landing and arrival into BLR was also well ahead of time. However when the time came to collect the baggage, I had noticed that again the new bag tag which I had attached with my name was no longer present and this was a bag tag that I had just purchased recently and put. Even last week when I travelled from Kolkata to Mumbai even then my baggage tag was removed off, so it seems that Air India is having issues with my baggage tag and probably this is something that they need to look into. But other than that, this was a welcome flight and I am hoping that the next time I travel, they give refreshments service rather than the plain sandwich that they usually give.",,,,,
" Flight to go to India was 9 hrs delayed. Today flew back to Italy 7 hrs delay. No service, nothing this is a company to really avoid! Most of international flights delayed. Bad company, never never use again.",,,,,
"  I would like to express my gratitude for the excellent service provided by staff. The air hostesses, Praveet and Preeti, were exceptional in their duties and displayed a remarkable level of professionalism throughout the flight. While the overall service was commendable, I would like to bring to your attention a minor issue regarding the in-flight entertainment system. Unfortunately, the screens in our section were not working properly. ",,,,,
" Bad experience. 2 long flights, 6 hours delay without compensation. On both flights, the sockets and the entertainment did not work. Not mine, nor the socket of the adjacent seats. The cabin staff is nice and pretends that the problem is solvable, but they seem pretty aware that it is not. For the delay, upon request, a ticket was provided for a lounge which was actually a loud café offering another meal very much like the one on the plane, and 0.33 ml water.",,,,,
"  With Tata having purchased Air India and Air India being a Star Alliance partner I thought what could go wrong. My new name for Air India is Air Never Again. The seats, service, cleanliness and ticketing were all terrible. We flew nine carriers on our month-long trip. None of them were close to being as bad as Air India. The discount air carriers Scoop and Batik put Air India to shame. The direct competitors Singapore, United and Cathay were so far superior that you'd have to drug me and tie to a seat to ever get me to set foot on Air India again. The plane was filthy. The seats torture devices left over from the Middle Ages. My in-seat entertainment system was broken but functional. I pointed it out so that it might be serviced on the ground and got a, ""no, one cares shrug"". The service was non-existent. The flight attendants made two appearances and then were nowhere to be found after meal and drink service. They just disappeared while leaving water in the open galley. The food was the worst of any airline food I've eaten or tried to eat. The beverage service was miserly. Nope. One and done. Loved India. Been there several times. Will go again just not on Air India.",,,,,
"  As I had booked this flight at a discount rate, I was a bit anxious about whether I would get a seat on this flight considering it was the weekend and planes have been flying full literally. To my surprise, I didn't have to wait for long in order to check in and get my boarding pass. The flight boarding and departure were on time and there were a few vacant seats. For breakfast I opted for the veg option which was consisting of an uttapam, sev upma, a croissant with mango yogurt which was pretty good. However, during the beverage service, I noticed that the staff were initially serving the front couple of rows but then due to turbulence they had to stop it midway but didn't bother to proactively ask the passengers for beverages when they were taking away the eating trays which was a surprise. Perhaps they might have just forgotten or due to the turbulence they had to stop it midway without asking passengers but either way that wasn't good. Arrival to Mumbai was on time however I had noticed that upon retrieval of my luggage, my baggage name tag that I had put had got torn out which was not good as previously back in January too they had misplaced my luggage and again they had not handled the baggage properly so this is something that they need to look into. I would still recommend as I got huge value for the fare that I paid.",,,,,
" I travelled in direct flight from Toronto to Delhi with my brother on 26 June 2023. The entire plane smelled like public washroom. It was so disgusting. The entertainment screen was not working for me and my brother and for many more people. We informed the crew member and she assured it will be fixed soon. Two hours later when I asked them again, all they had to say was ""sorry, we tried but only technical person will be able to fix it"". The meal they served was not fresh. My brother had booked non-veg option for meal when booking tickets and he got vegetarian meal, that too, 1 hour late than others and had hair in it. When we asked the crew, she said their economy meal was over so they are serving whatever they could arrange. You guys are not even aware how many people are flying with you, forget the rest. WE PAID $2300 CAD for the ticket which I think was not worth it. This was probably my first and last flight with Air India. Never travelling again and won't even recommend it to anyone.",,,,,
"  Unfortunately again experiencing this airline, and it’s air-conditioning not working. We all are sitting and waiting for more than 40 minutes in plane without air-conditioning right away. Again bad experience.",,,,,
  Totally uncomfortable seats and again entertainment system is not working and even power outlet is not working. This is my 3rd trip and same all 3 times. Seems like this is my last flight with Air India. No value for money.,,,,,
" I never write reviews, this is the first time I am giving my feedback. Me and my family were traveling to London last month by Air India. I would like to say that their Flights are really in bad conditions. Food was not cooked. Chicken they served was uncooked. TV screens were not working at all, while going to London only one screen was working from our row. But while returning back all three screens were not in a working condition. Also I had ordered a kids meal for my baby, but they also forgot that. If we had called them for any assistance there was nobody there to help. Staff were in their own world. I will never recommend this airline to anybody.",,,,,
  Worst quality of food provided. The paneer roll was uncooked and not baked properly. No tray for breakfast was given. No tissue paper was given. No water in urinals.,,,,,
"  Worst flight. First time I travel on Air India and this will be the last time. Food quality is the worst, no entertainment, screens are not working for almost 50 percent of flight and the the response from air hostess is they will provide magazines to read. They dont keep the washrooms clean for a 15 hour flight. I would say never travel Air India.",,,,,
"  Just dreading my return flight to Melbourne on Air India, a junk airline that does not have any in-flight equipment working. No entertainment, no call lights, no seat reclining. A personal message to avoid Air India even if given free tickets. Gone are the days of the Maharaja of the skies.",,,,,
"  In flight staff are unprofessional and none of the things (charging point, entertainment screen, no proper ventilation) are working in-flight. Airport ground staffs were equally unprofessional! They keep on asking stranded passengers to follow them unknowingly without proper and definitive reasons and explanations. HIGH miscommunication levels between staffs and passengers. Zero empathy and even shouted at passengers for not following their orders. Flights were delayed, cancelled, changed to a new flight, delayed again. A terrible nightmare.",,,,,
"  Reached 3 hours prior to departure time. Took more than 45 minutes for baggage check in due to less staff at the check in counters Even after repeated feedback, nothing was done Disappointed!",,,,,
" I had the opportunity to travel on AI flights twice in the last 3 months during my trips to India. I haven't been adventurous enough to try them out international as I've heard my share of horror stories. I'm going to base my review on the 2 Pune-Delhi flights I've taken in this period. Booking: AI fares were similar or cheaper than the corresponding fares on no frills airlines. AI is full service. Which means 25 kgs of check-in luggage and meals served on-board. A huge win right away. Online booking was easy and not complicated compared to some top notch international airlines sites. Rating: 10/10 Check In: The check-in counter for AI literally had no queues while the rest of the airlines had long ones. That did make me somewhat nervous the first time. As it turns out eventually, the flights both times were completely full so I have no idea how they managed to avoid queues at check-in. Maybe fewer flights? Nevertheless, the check-in agent was quick, efficient, polite, addressed me properly by name and directed me to my gate. I was out and about in no time - both times. No complaints. Rating: 10/10 Boarding: Boarding commenced 10 mins later than scheduled. On both the flights I took. However the boarding process was quick and smooth and the lot of us were on board in no time. Rating: 8/10 Crew: On both occasions, the cabin stewards / stewardesses were polite, efficient and thoroughly professional. Albeit the first flight, they weren't overly keen to smile. On the second flight, they were in the finest spirits they could possibly be and literally went overboard to please. A very very warm welcome and top notch crew experience. 10/10 The craft: This was an older A320. Not the Neo version. Strangely, there was a defunct screen on the back of the seat in front of me and I had (non working) screen controls. None of the others did. I guess, they reused some seats from other aircraft. The seat pitch was pretty comparable to other domestic carriers. At 5ft7, I had decent enough knee room. But the seat width - that was definitely a bonus. Wider than economy seats in not just other domestic flights, but much wider than the seats in many international long hauls on the newer A350s and B787s. That made a huge impact and I did not have to fight it out with my co-passenger for rights over the arm rest. Of course, the cabin did look a bit dated with some scuff marks on the plastics. But it was all clean and the colour scheme was uplifting. Rating: 7/10 Meals: Dinner was served. Chicken korma with rice and some veggies. Some yoghurt and a brownie cake. Was decent fare. Served with steel cutlery. Thank you AI! International carriers make note, it's criminal to serve food with plastic cutlery. Why do you do it? The cutlery looked a big light and flimsy and I did a stress test, it was actually quite rigid and strong. Well done. Service was quick and as efficient as how I was getting used to by now. 8/10 Punctuality: Both times on AI, the flight took off ahead of schedule and reached New Delhi 30-35 mins ahead of schedule! I repeat - 30-35 mins ahead of schedule. On a flight that had a flying time of about 2 hrs!! This is serious WOW. Super impressed. 10/10! Extras: Throughout the trip, I kept getting emails and SMSs from AI with status updates on departure gates and other bits and bobs of info. I even got alerts for when my bags were loaded onto the aircraft. Who does that?! Whopping 10/10 Overall: An overwhelmingly surprised 10/10.",,,,,
"  There was a 2hr baggage clearance at Mumbai connection. This caused us to miss the flight, and reschedule it for next day. The hotel and food are horrible. Next day again the rescheduled flight was delayed for couple of hours due to technical issues. Worst experience ever, and I will not recommend anyone to board an Air India flight. The staffs and support center has no experience handling these situations.",,,,,
 The airline seats are absolutely atrocious. The seat fabric is filthy so much so that I didn't want to sit on it. But when I did I realised the seat backs are just flat cardboard and wood. Far worse than the seats on Chennai's local buses. I was really shocked and disgusted and won't ever fly Air India again.,,,,,
" The flight legroom was good, that the only positive side I could remember. The service is horrible, food and drink menu absolutely rubbish. So selection for non-veg. More over the food not even pack individually, serving like buffet. When web check in not even give option to choose meal type. I don't know the cabin crew do feedback to company. This is not one time my parents travelled up and down Cochin to Gatwick had same service, not all human beings are potato and lentil eaters.",,,,,
" Worst Airlines and worst customer support. My flight got cancelled 2 days before departure and I was not even sent a notification or message or any email regarding the same. I had contacted the customer care about problem of not being able to check in, it was then they told me. They didn't even care enough to book another flight just initiated the refund, but now I have to bear that additional cost of booking another flight at last minute.",,,,,
"  Worst experience. After making us sit inside the plane they announced that flight delayed by one hour due to congestion, no news after even two hours and then started giving us excuses like ground staff clearance and after 6 hours sitting in the plane they started fueling. There were a lot of arguments in the plane with staff and ground clearance but they never listened. Most probably they did not have to fuel or their was an issue between pilot and ground staff as the pilot after being coerced after nearly 4 hours of no response from him announced that ground staff will speak. The pilot never came out of the cockpit to speak to the passengers, never seen such kind of chaos. Will never fly air india",,,,,
"  The web check-in was harrowing, they disabled the default free seat that was assigned after selecting another seat, and there was no way to return to the default option. This is a bit of a scam when one is forced to pay for a seat equivalent to the auto-assigned seat. The customer service was of no help at all.",,,,,
  Air India now owned by Tatas but overall service and customer experience still lacking and poor. I travelled from Singapore to Bangalore and then boarded Air India. The flight left my baggage at Bangalore and I had to waste 2 hrs in Mumbai airport. I was told that in my baggage side pocket there was a lighter. I acknowledged and appreciated their promptness. On my return the flight was again delayed by 2 hrs. Someone opened my bag and lifted it. The food served inflight during lunch was also pathetic. I had planned to have my lunch in Bangalore however due to a delay had to rely on Air India. I just had sweet yogurt and returned the rest. Thank you for landing me safely.,,,,,
"  Overall good customer service, quick check-in, 3 meals on Syd - Del sector and one meal Del - BOM sector. Staff were attentive and courteous. decent leg space. Normally 787 has a high level of humidity and moisture but these aircraft were very dry don't know did they change the settings as a result you feel quite dry on these flights. I was lucky my entertainment unit worked but the volume is always high. The aircraft was clean, but their bathroom stinks. Except for the bathroom and entertainment, all went well.",,,,,
"  With mechanical fault they held passengers for nearly 4 hours on flight, then authority did not get any responsibility over them. Still no replacement flight when I am writing this review.",,,,,
"  We had a flight AI127 from New Delhi to Chicago on June 2023. I was accompanied with my 5 year old daughter. My daughter was super excited to go to USA and she said I will watch TV and play games to kill the time since she is not comfortable with long travel. Our seat number was good. To our shock, the seat was completely broken, no headphones were working, the touch was off and the button to adjust the seat was also broken. So, just imagine how does it feel when you are told that you have to sit in upright position for next 14 hours. I am taking Air India off my list now, never ever travelling back in Air India again. We complained to the Air Hostess, she said, ""Yeah can't help it, I will reboot the system, there might be some technical glitch or let me find some other seat for you"" but she did not do anything. I felt like jumping off the flight, my daughter was crying for the screen to play some games but I was so helpless. Air hostess doesn’t have a smiley face, they were in a angry face and we couldn’t feel to ask anything if we need.",,,,,
" Worst inflight experience I’ve ever had. TV Screens not working nor there is a facility to call crew, seats are broken and the food served was pathetic. Had to wait for 3/4 hours to get even water during flight. Heard Bad reviews about Air India before and thought there will be improvements after Its acquired by Tata but no difference. Never travel again if possible completely avoid.",,,,,
" Air India has very poor customer service onboard the aircraft. No flight attendant came to even offer water after 3-4 hours. Snacks were given before the beginning of the flight. In 14 hours of the flight only 1 time a meal was provided, there was also no warm food. Customer service is getting worse day by day. Everyone expected that since Mr. Ratan Tata took over Air India, he would make necessary steps to improve customer service, make flight tickets more reasonable and improvements in aircraft interior including TV screens in front of the seats but unfortunately nothing has improved. It is disappointing. At the airport after checking in for the international flight from Delhi to Toronto, my mother-in-law was harassed for return flight which was not booked at that time. Couple of staff members of the STAR ALLIANCE harassed her and took her boarding pass and refused to let her go to board on flight 45min before the departure of the flight to Toronto. I do not understand who gives airlines (Air India or Star Alliance) authority to ask for passengers return flight? This is ridiculous and I hope my message reaches the right authority in India to take necessary steps to stop such nonsense behavior at the airport. If I still had option for travelling with Jet Airways, I would never ever travel with Air India. Sadly, Jet Airways is no longer active.",,,,,
"  Good experience overall. Positives: Great leg room for the long flight. Warm staff, higher check-in limits (25Kg) and smooth landing. Areas of Improvement: Food could be a tad better (but its still decent), Punctuality.",,,,,
"  I had a bad experience flying Air India, My flight from JFK to Bangalore with 2 hours Lay over at Mumbai. Ticket was booked 30 days in advance . 1 day before my journey Airindia cancelled my connecting flight from Mumbai to Bangalore and scheduled next flight which is after 16 hours, when asked customer service all i get a response stating flight is cancelled because of technical reason. When asked to change the itinerary they want me to pay extra amount for seat. This is absolutely ridiculous where they have no remorse on their mistake and hardly any empathy on customer inconvenience caused by them. This is my last time flying Air India",,,,,
" Can an airline be this inefficient! From beginning to end! AI has given nothing but lousy service and that is being generous. I landed in Delhi at 11pm and my plane to Toronto was supposed to leave at 3.35am. They said that it was delayed and will start at 5am. The staff made a big show of checking documents which started at 3.30am. Our documents were checked three times at least. Just to kill time and to make a show that something was being done! There was no order to the boarding! We boarded around 4 am and now it’s 7am and we are still sitting on the plane- a closed space, with people coughing. In 3 hours no water was even served and besides the initial announcement no updates to the passengers. We are being treated as cattle and not human beings. There’s no courtesy of keeping us in the loop. This is a broken down plane. Nothing works. For a 14 1/2 hour non-stop flight, there’s no entertainment. Honestly, at this point I wonder if I will get where I need to get, alive and in one piece. AI is playing with our lives and is being extremely disrespectful of our time. We have lives and jobs to get to and there’s a reason we plan a trip. This is the second time I have flown AI in 6 months, for lack of finding any other airline and this is the second time I’ve sat in the plane for 4 hours while technical issues are being dealt with! I would give this negative stars if the option were available!",,,,,
" Had a wonderful experience flying with Air India business class flight to Cochin. The crew were extremely welcoming. Service was to the best standard and we reached cochin earlier than the arrival time. I felt I should take time out to thank the lovely ladies Jeneeta and Aanchal who made the flying experience comfortable. Aanchal helped me with the breakfast, her presentation and confidence was worth a praise. Jeneeta (Apologies if the name is misspelled), was caring and helped with patiently with my charging issue. Overall I'm highly impressed with my flying experience with Air India and also booked my return tickers to Sydney with them.",,,,,
 We at 6.45 am are still waiting for the cabin crew to arrive for the flight which was supposed to board by 5.10 am. The cabin crew not arrived yet. This has caused a suffering to so many passengers. All of us are stuck because of the captain and his crew members. Can the Air India never improve?,,,,,
"  Worst flight experience, which includes boarding airport service etc. Even if you have to pay extra dollars please prefer to use any other airlines. Never had this flight experience anywhere before. Poor customer care, grumpy hostess, unhygienic food. They don’t care about passengers.",,,,,
" The flight was great! The staff were extremely kind and helpful, the entertainment system were very easy-to-use and the food was really good as well. The inside of the flight was very nice (All Air India flights are being renovated to match or be even better than the likes of Emirates and Qatar Airways). This was one of the best flights I have been on, better than British Airways, Etihad and tied to Lufthansa.",,,,,
" My flight from Dubai to Delhi on 13th June was horrendous, flight was delayed for 2 hours. I'm okay with delay but when we started boarding they were checking our hand luggage weight and supposedly it has to be 8 kgs at Max but they allowed 12 kgs to go through as well. When I sat on my allocated seat my IFE system wasn't working. Not only for me but the column 30-40 ABC. Our hostess were not professional. The food was served 45 mins before landing as they ran out of food. All in all the worst flight experience with Air India for me.",,,,,
" One can keep writing a negative review endlessly if unluckily he has traveled by Air India, but I'll keep it short, and here is my review: The flight was delayed by 5 hours. Passengers were barred from entering the airport building as the flight was delayed to avoid overcrowding and a makeshift counter without personnel was arranged and of course without a proper seating facility. There were hardly 15 chairs for more than 100 people. As it is summer in Saudi Arabia the temperature outside was around 40 degrees Celsius. The airline representative appeared once in a while and responded rudely to any queries on flight status. Experience inside the plane is another horrible experience. We felt like we were in an airplane just because it was flying. Other than that it is comparable to local buses in developing countries. Seats were small and uncomfortable even with economy standards. Regarding the food, I bet it cannot be any cheaper than what was served. I have pledged not to travel with Air India anymore. Best of luck to those who still want to try flying with Air India.",,,,,
" No proper response from any of the staff. Hiding all the information about flight timings. Flight got delayed for more than 14 hours. After entering into flight again a delay of one more hour for the staff to come. And the passengers with connecting international flight from Mumbai suffered a lot because of these delays. One sincere and humble request from passengers please change your staff or train your staff but please don't trouble the passenger ENTIRE NIGHT SPENT ON AIRPORT, CHANGED GATE 7 TIMES. Cancelled the flight after making us wait for 7 (till 3 am  hours whereas people who had not checked in were informed at 10 only and told to come for morning flight/we were subsequently shifted to the morning flight at 5.10, which took off at 8. Third rate airline with third rate staff. Infants and old people were really suffering - book at your peril",,,,,
"  Ground support - good Lounge - good Boarding - bit messy (mainly because some people do not follow boarding instructions Welcome - friendly Seats - 2-2 , no flat bed, limited recline, less leg space (well, I am 183 cm), no in-seat entertainment Service - good ( excellent work) Recommend - not really",,,,,
" Ground staff - fantastic (managed by DNATA) Lounge - no (under renovation). Voucher provided for F&B outlets but not honored by any of the outlets. Boarding - normal. No hassle Welcome - warm and friendly Seat - 1F Pro - flat bed, TUMI amenity bag, slippers, sleepwear, Cons - poor condition of seats ( maintenance) damaged power sockets, Screen size comparable to economy class, poor selection of programs, no storage space in and around the seat, Food - good Staff - super efficient and friendly Lesson - new route doesn’t mean new aircraft!! Return - probably when the new aircraft’s are deployed",,,,,
  One of the worst flight experiences in my history.  A 15 hour flight without In Flight entertainment. It is unimaginable in 2023. If the screen works the audio does not work and Vice versa. I pre booked my seats and they would sit us separately saying your flight is canceled and told us to sit where they allot us as if they are doing us a favor. There was no WiFi in the flight. ,,,,,
"  Shame on Air India. Continuous 7 hours delay, Mumbai to Bangalore flight. At first it was scheduled at 17:55 & now to 22:40. Never ever i have experienced such poor service from any airline. Air India should learn from IndiGo, about customer loyalty & service's.",,,,,
" Worst airline. Very poor flight management. Poor communication with passengers inside the airport. No body to take any responsibility, acting like children, only they are getting in a panic instead of being efficient. Please try to increase your on time, communication with passengers, give steady answers to passengers. Disappointed regarding flight AI573, 12/6/2023, flight has unconditional delay. Nobody knows why.",,,,,
  The seats broken. Entertainment not working. The switch to call attendant not working. Food quality horrible. Booked food as Jain meal not provided as given to someone else. Wrong information given by crew for luggage belt.,,,,,
"  As an Indian national, I can tell this is the worst flight experience I ever have. Seat front Tv was not working for the whole flight for all the way for 15 hrs flight, the Hostess were not friendly and maybe as a Indian they don't care about us because we already bought a ticket. Seats arm rests were all wobbly not fixed.",,,,,

"  This was a flight that I had to take early morning due to the alternatives having much higher fares especially over weekends. The check in for the flight and the ground experience was quite good and even the flight boarding started on time for what seemed to be like a 90-95% full flight. The staff at check-in offered me seat 4F at the front that had no other seats in front of them which resulted in extra legroom. Pushback started on time and once airborne the breakfast service commenced and I had opted for the non veg course that consisted of an omlette, chicken sausage with spinach and hash browns. along with a croissant and yoghurt. The meal itself was pretty good. However one thing that I had noticed which was not appreciated was the fact that the tray table was not properly cleaned. The landing happened on time and I had no difficulty in getting my luggage. Overall for the price that was paid, this was actually a very good flight. Thanks to the crew and team.",,,,,
"  Worst experience ever. Staff don't even know how to talk to passengers. Never going to fly air India again. Air India is a waste of money, flights get delayed, worst experience ever.",,,,,
  Worst experience ever. Coordination between ground staff and cabin staff is zero. My flight was planned to departure at 2215hrs right now im sitting inside the flight for almost one hour and did not even got a cup of water. Keep Air India as your last option. ,,,,,
"  Check at Newark airport was good not issues but in plane in entertainment system was broken even usb charges were also broken actually most of them broken on plane seats were uncomfortable and broken. Staff was courteus. I had requested a wheel chair but at Mumbai Airport there were multiple wheel chair operators they told me stay asked somebody will take you shortly but nobody took me finally they told me please go up to the immigration counter somebody will be there to help you but nobody was there again. I was told to walk up to ramp to pick up your luggage, you will get wheel chair there again no body helped me there either since I have some health issues hardly I could pick up luggage and took it up to security by doing this I hurt my shoulder and back I was told to take up my luggage up to domestic terminal that was far away it’s really very poor service provided by Air India",,,,,
"  The flight from Toronto Was delayed by 13 hours - luckily we were informed by sms before hand. The flight was to leave from Toronto on 6th June at 1 a.m. When I went to business lounge on airport at 10:30 after security, they told us that the food counter will close in 10 min. and the lounge will close at 11 p.m. I asked them, what am I supposed to do till the gates are open, they said sit at the gate we can't help. Is this right? Am I not entitled for any compensation when my flight got delayed by 13 hrs? On 19th May 2023, I took a flight from DEL to YYZ, with my wife, 80% of the monitors in economy, business as well as first class were not working (flight time 15 hrs). Some seats were not reclining! We were in Business Class",,,,,
"  We 3 people (2 adults and 1 child) were travelling from London to Kochi via Delhi. We missed the flight 4am) from Delhi to Kochi because of our child was continuously vomiting and it was early morning 4am flight. But we reached airport little late (4:10am) they failed to arrange alternate flight for us and they told us to book new seats. They said you will get email after some time, as PNR is generated no issue. We trusted them and returned back to hotel. We didn't receive the email at all and we contacted the costumer service they also said its okay just go to airport and get the boarding pass. We went to airport little early (2am) with all our luggage, and child. When we arrived they said that in your name no seats book and all seats are full we cannot help you. We showed PNR number, they said but as you didn't get email we cant do anything. We went to manager of the Air India, she didn't show any interest in helping or solving the issue. We checked with other airlines. They had 2 seats, one seat like that so we had to book new tickets again with Vistara next day morning (3am) and we returned back to hotel again with all our bags (25kg bags, hand luggage) and child. Horrible service by Air India. Horrible staff members and irresponsible, non cooperative. They were all laughing making fun of each other and customers, no seriousness and no helping nature. It all happened in Delhi international airport. As we were confused and standing what to do, we were just observing them, they are so careless even for old people who are approaching them and they don't know the language Hindi or English. They are very careless they are not there for helping others they are not serious about their job. ",,,,,
"  I boarded a flight from JFK to BOM on Monday, May 1st. The flight was scheduled to take off at 10:45 AM but was delayed until 5:20 PM (nearly 7 hours). Everyone had to deplane. Air India only provided each of us a $15 meal voucher for the long delay. On my way back to JFK from New Delhi on Thursday, May 18th at 2:20 AM, I asked an Air India check-in rep if he could upgrade me to business class. He said no because all the seats have already been taken. When I boarded and got off that flight, I saw that wasn't the case. I decided to submit a case on the Air India website and then was prompted to email [email protected]. I sent them an explanation on Friday, May 19th detailing all the inconvenience that was caused. Surprisingly, they replied to my email on the same day saying that they have ""shared details with the concerned airport"" and once they receive a response, they will get back to me.  I never received a response from them ever again. I requested a follow-up on May 29th, May 30th, and finally June 6th via email. I also called Air India on June 6th, but the rep kept asking me for my ticket number. I informed him that I've already flown and do not remember my ticket number. I asked him how I can find out this number. He didn't provide any assistance. Instead, he only repeated himself and decided to hang up. Very frustrating. I am appalled by the customer support team's lack of urgency and horrible service.",,,,,
"  How bad airline service can be? We got a text message at 630 am today (June 5th) saying our flight for June 6th from JFK is delayed and all other connecting flights are moved as well - resulting in 24 hour delay. Email was sent with just two options - accept or cancel! So, called Orbitz (another useless service provider), they booked our flight to JFK-Mumbai - MAA and sent confirmation email etc all good. Then in 2 hours, we check, our tickets were cancelled.- including original booking! called Air India, nohelp - blamed Orbitz.. called Orbitz, same process again, rebooked, showed up in Air india, after 2 hours.. magic, ticket disappeared.  Air India - no help total failure to take care of customers and causing anxiety -- 24 hours before start of important trip.. will never book in AI ever again. ",,,,,
"  I did not like the plane's interior quality and how it was maintained. The plane was so old that the seats and infotainment systems were broken. People were literally trying to change seats to watch something in the screens. The most ridiculous part of all is that a manual in airlines said to not remove shoes. The people removed shoes and literally lied down on the seats, with blankets on, as if it were their beds at home. The crew did not care and was least concerned about correcting the mess. The washrooms were clogged and stinky. The attendant call was not heard for 45 minutes and till the time I stopped one myself to ask for water. I hated my overall flight experience. I don't know if these reviews are heard and seen by this airline to improve their service, but my experience travelling with them was the worst of all the airlines I have travelled with. I hope the review is heard and service is improved to make an impression.",,,,,
"  I had a 3 connecting flights from air India confirmed. In Gatwick airport at the time of check-in air India staff said i will get my bags direct in Kolkata last stop. But when i asked the crew member they said i will get it from Goa. Another part had a 9.40 hours continuous flight from Gatwick to Goa there were no charging points working, all were broken.  When asked for assistance to crew members they were like ""I am sorry"". Seats were full of debris, window mirror was not wiped there were stains on it. Avoid booking Air India. Made a big mistake. After coming down to Goa airport there was a layover for about 5 hours and after standing in a cue for 1.5 hours for check in again the staff said you have to wait for ""30 minutes more"". Like seriously there is no one to manage customers. No managers. No seating arrangements. Had yo wait standing in front of counter and then again had to wait in cue for 3 hours for check in.",,,,,
"  I took Air India for a G20 meeting as an official. The major disappointments are old planes with no inflight entertainment, and incompetent and rude ground services. I would give the credits to cabin crews who tried their best to be helpful though. Check in staffs need to be better informed on visa requirements, so not to annoy customers with proper requirements waiting. India's chaotic airport security is already a nightmare, but a ground staff in Delhi made it worse. In my experience, airport security staffs made a horrible mistake of not stamping my boarding pass. And an Air India staff at the boarding gate was very rude as if I was someone with a security risk. He made me wait to board the plane last without a proper explanation, to a point that a security lady was nice enough to give a calming gesture and signalling the boarding staff is rather a rude one.",,,,,
 One of the worst airlines. Rude employees. My flight was canceled and the refund is still not processed. Upon calling the relevant people there is no proper communication instead they hung up the phone saying I don’t know.,,,,,
"  The flight is the same in which I traveled to Chennai 1 month prior. There is no difference between domestic and international flight. No screens, seats also ok, does not give any international feel. The meal served was very much less in quantity. Just 2 spoons of rice mixed with Manchurian. Along with that curd was been given which was no where a combination. The meal was horrible. Many of them received veg though they had choose non veg. Very disappointing.",,,,,
" The worst and irresponsible airline I have ever seen or had. My friend and I had a ticket of Air India from Vancouver to Delhi on May 21st. The flight had delay for 14 hours and finally they canceled that. They don't care about people, infants and elderly people at all. A very irresponsible and unorganized airline. I don't suggest this airline to anyone.",,,,,
" Pathetic experience as the seats were not clean, no screens were working in the row E, the food was not tasty, half of the cuisine was made with corns only. Only crew at the back rows were very polite and decent, two female and one male member very nice. Very uncomfortable seats. The experience at the ground level was also pathetic as the ground staff was asking unnecessary questions which were not relevant at all. When one person has a visa of the country he or she is travelling to then even they were asking irrelevant questions as in where is the invitation letter, how many days is the stay for thought already shown the return ticket. Invitation letter is to be asked by the immigration dept not with the airline travelling with. Then after check in and immigration when finally entering in the aircraft again the person is asking where is the invite - what makes sense out of it, don't understand. It is just to unnecessarily harassing the passengers. I think we all are educated and we know the rules and regulations to be followed while travelling then why unnecessary harassment. Air India needs to improve a lot on their quality.",,,,,
  I am really disappointed with international travel with Air India from London Heathrow to Delhi. there is no any improvement in flight comfort. Every time their video display are not working and very rarely its starts all of sudden and again stop working in between. No provision of headphones. Seats are not at all hygienic and not kept clean. Restrooms cleanliness not maintained its too unhygienic.,,,,,
"  No Inflight Entertainment. When I asked the staff regarding this they clearly said that the airline knew about this and they have taken the aircraft from the Hangar and deployed it. The journey was 12 hours and with no in flight entertainment, it was a nightmare. The return journey from Delhi to Melbourne was the same if not worse. No7 Inflight entertainment again, No reclining seats. With my ticket purchase I paid to have the In flight entertainment as a part of what this airline advertised. This is False advertising",,,,,
  Boarding was on time took my seat and relaxed with a glass of champagne. Announcement was made we have a tech issue and power was turned off. After approx 20min had to deboard then after 5hrs waiting in the gate lounge they announced that the flight was cancelled. Another hour waiting I was finally rebooked onto Emirates and sent to a hotel for a few hours (all played for by IA). So disappointed that I never got to fly.,,,,,
"  Delhi to San Francisco and the flight was so horrible. First time I was traveling by Air India and I will not recommend anyone to travel by Air India. The seat is so tight space (not comfortable), the entertainment system was broke down in the entire flight (almost 17hrs non stop journey). I ordered Muslim food when I booked the ticket but on the plane during my journey I was not given the Muslim/halal food. The food I was given was not eatable.  I will never travel by Air India and not recommend anyone to travel also by AI.",,,,,
My flight was scheduled rom Amritsar to Delhi and from Delhi to New York. The flight was delayed to the point that  every passenger missed their connecting flights. On top of this i had another flight from New York to Vancouver the next day which I missed and had a book a new flight for 400$. I talked to the airline staff and they said that the flight to Vancouver is not with their airline so they couldn't provide me any compensation. They didn't even care to look for any other flights from Amritsar to Delhi to help the passengers catch their connecting flights. Such a bad experience that I'll never travel with this airline in future no matter what. e.,,,,,
"  Absolutely primitive aircraft, None of the on-Board Audio systems work. You've to look at the sky or blank screen to spend time. Crew and their services were good, helpful. However, they can't fix everything on broken Aircrafts. Ticket prices are not any way cheaper than competitors flying to Kolkata. Except the Middle Seats in the Economy sections, one has to pay to get windows or aisle seats. It's not cheap, costs CAD 61.90. The aircraft quality must improve.",,,,,
"  First time I am flying Air India after take over by Tata. There was a noticeable change in counter service at both Chennai and Bengaluru. Cabin crew in the flight were warm and food was top class. Area where attention is required is toilet upkeep during the flight, and the seat comfort",,,,,
"  The service on this flight was better than the last time I flew. Usually the staff are really rude, but on this flight it was alright especially Mohammed in the cabin was good. This time the tv was working unlike most of the times it's not working. For a 9hr flight it's really boring",,,,,
  I flew to Delhi and back and the service was very poor. I have flown other airlines and they were so much more nicer. Return trip was a nightmare and was more than an hour late and the seats and toilets not cleaned. No hot towels were given either. The female attendant was more keen on jumping around and not serving!,,,,,
  Bad food (especially London to Delhi sector). Entertainment not working on one side of the plane London to Delhi. Staff new and not efficient - taking too much time to serve even though flight running half capacity.,,,,,
"  I had very pathetic & unpleasant experience flying with Air India. In flight experience was really bad. Aircraft was really old. Seats were unserviceable, handle & foot rest were broken and adjusted with Tapes. Seat covers were torn. Food Quality was really really bad. Flight entertainment system was also not working. I will never travel again with Air India and will not recommend to anyone to waste money.",,,,,
"  My comment is mainly for safety concern. I was allotted seat at emergency exit row, along with me in same row one was senior citizen and one was obese. I have request that emergency exit seats to be allocated to passengers which can actually help in evacuation in case of emergency. Please look into the issue for future flights considering safety of passengers",,,,,
" Absolutely disappointed to fly with Air India. From the first step in, it was shocking. The odour in the aircraft, no in-flight entertainment on a 13 hours flight, no proper information provided by the crew due to lack of knowledge, the condition of the physical aircraft interior, cleanliness, everything was poor.",,,,,
"  Would never fly again. Didn't have a working screen for the whole flight and wasn't the only one on board who didn't, 2 of the 3 screens in the row were broken. When I pressed the buzzer for assistance it went unanswered for 40 minutes and eventually had to get someone, despite crew resetting the screens they remained broken and they didn't offer any further assistance. My seat also didn't recline which was very uncomfortable for sleeping. The flights were not cheap. I contacted them about my complaints and received no answer so they clearly don't care about customer service. The food was good and the only positive thing I can say.",,,,,
"  I travelled on AI171 from Ahmedabad to London Gatwick on 20 th April and during beverages I asked cabin crew for two cans of beer, so was served. Later I asked for more Beer and cabin crew lady said you can have later. I waited two hours and I called and asked and she said I can't have beer. She was not friendly to customers.  Also TV screen was not working.",,,,,
"  
Faced very bad experience in plane, no proper care by air hostess team. No proper bag allocation for passengers, we carried out luggage on our laps in our entire journey which made us very uncomfortable to sit for such long time. We wish we would never choose this airline again.",,,,,
"  Have not travelled with this airline since 2016 but this time the crew and food was improved. We had 3 flights with them Cochin to Mumbai, Mumbai to Aurangabad return to Mumbai. ",,,,,
"  I have read mixed reviews of this flight. But it was an excellent flight with top notch service.  It was a proper three course meal. The food was 5 star level. I cannot say about Veg food, because I eat non veg and they gave us food three times. With regards to drinks, it was pretty decent with good brands. The TV was working properly, but I usually see the maps and do some work or read books. Towards the end of flight, the supervisor came and asked each passenger about their experience. On my return flight, it was the same experience, but some TV's were not working, but since the flight was empty, they adjusted the passengers in different seats if needed.  The team of Monica and Hiren were good. The flight from NYC to Mumbai had better food then from Mumbai to NYC. Both the flights were on time.  I understand that because of 2-3-2 seating, there was privacy issue. ",,,,,
"  For our 3 seats the entertainment units were not working, for my seat the headset was not working and I was told to just read the subtitles by the team member and that this would definitely keep me entertained! My friend in the next seat’s remote was not working and she was told to entertain herself through the 12 hour flight. The entertainment units not working on a day flight was frustrating, however the team members words were infuriating for us. The bathrooms were a mess throughout the journey and the crew were not keen to tidy them up. service was slow but professional. Admittedly nervous about our journey back home next week.",,,,,
"  Terrible customer service. Will choose to never fly with them again. The aircraft entry staff is predatory, will make demands on charging for carry on and laptop bag even when items bought are only from duty free and within reasonable amounts of weight. The flights are always overbooked and staff at the doors are unhelpful if any queries are raised.",,,,,
"  Check in was smooth, website works, staff at counters were ok including those in Seoul. Food average. Domestic connections were ok and food served was hot.  Inflight announcements - poor audio quality, grammar and mistakes in announcement including time, does not look professional. Cabin heads were both male and generally invisible. Safety only on screen, only one out of pop down screens worked. In one case my inflatable was on the ground. Onboard entertainment non existent both my flights neither mine or my wife's worked, touch screen non responsive most inflight maps did not work. Headphones are not provided, both times i requested for same in one case the attendant apologized and said he did not have them. They said things will get fixed after refurbishment said will take two years. Food was bad and Rice was undercooked. No hot towels wet wipes or even chocolate we got a packet of rice crackers. Staff - good to average. Tokyo flight unresponsive and rude , opposite on my Seoul flight. Interiors worn out in both flights, lumbar support lacking and worn out seats thin reminded me of cheap domestic flights. ",,,,,
" Flew business class in Feb to New Delhi and back in March from Delhi to Vancouver. Aircraft is old and the seats didn't work. All broken. No TV's and the food was bad, expected a better service when flying business class. Can't imagine what economy would be. Bathroom were dirty, no soap or napkins. It seems like they don't really care knowing that People like to fly direct and they are the only option. Will not fly Air India again. Overhead bins were opening during turbulence. Felt very unsafe. On another note, staff did try their best and were very polite.",,,,,
" Air India still use a 3x3x3 seating plan on this aircraft in economy which allows for fairly spacious seating. Overall the aircraft (VT-ANG) was worn and in need of maintenance to the interiors. Only certain screens were operational on the IFE and even these were prone to locking up. The flight map was not available at all ! Aircraft cleaning could do with a lot of improvement. Check-in and boarding were good and the flight left over half an hour late but arrived ahead of schedule. Food served was average to poor - looks like some cutbacks have been made in this area. We had a connecting flight from Delhi and it is really annoying having to collect checked bags, walk through to a domestic check-in to deposit bags and then go airside again - nothing to do with the airline but Indian bureaucracy at it's best. Overall, the flight was OK but Air India are idling until the Tata investment can take off and revamp the product to a more modern standard.",,,,,
  Probably the worst airline. I flew from the Milan airport to New Delhi. The aircraft was extremely dirty with a foul smell from the toilets. We noticed that the toilet doors were broken and the door panel stuck which looks like temporary tapes. Twice the door was opened when someone was inside because of the door. Our seats were broken as the recliner didn’t work. In addition the touchscreen and controls of our inflight screen didn’t work. We spent 8 hours staring at air India logo on the screen. The croissant served for breakfast had gone off and very chewy so not edible. On a positive note the cabin crew were polite and professional. Never flying Air India again.,,,,,
" My flight was from Milan to Hyderabad and it was horrible with the baggage policy. I had to collect my baggage in Delhi and again re check-in in Delhi, there was a delay in flight too. I was told I can collect my luggage at Hyderabad but Air India failed to do so. This is unfair and bad service.",,,,,
"  We flew Air India on March 31st. Ground crew at Vancouver she is very nice and friendly. However the aircraft is too old. Seat armrests are broken and entertainment are not working. I could not even charge our devices. But the flight attendants specifically Chodden and Anisha are friendly, they made sure that our kids were entertained while on flight. I don't think we will be flying Air India in our future travel.",,,,,
  We were to fly on December 6 from EWR to DEL. When we arrived at the Airport there were no reps from Air India. There was Airport Ground staff and they were telling the 300 passengers that the plane that was supposed to come did not leave India. Apparently there were some Operational issues all over the US. We were told to go back home and come at midnight the same day. Surprisingly when we contacted Air India they did not have a clue and kept saying that the flight was on time. I showed the Rep the status on the internet and then they suddenly became aware of the issue. I told them that I had to fly the same day due to a death in the family but they were reluctant to help in any way or offer a seat with a partner airline. They simply said we cannot help you. ,,,,,
"  Rusty old broken aircraft. Ground staff at Vancouver airport misguided me for not upgrading my flight to business so unable to upgrade my tickets and suffered a flight in economy class. Booked seats by paying extra money and seats were the worst. Broken arms broken entertainment system. Nothing was working at all. For 15 hrs of the flight we just sitting looking at blank’s screen. Very very poor aircraft, rusty or cushions broken seats, useless entertainment systems.Even though business and economy seats were vacant the crew were not able to provide us alternatives which is a shame. I will never ever travel again on Air India flights and would never recommend anyone using it.",,,,,
  I first travelled in May 2022 and had return flight Aug 20th 2022. As per the itinerary I reached the airport and stood up in the line and when I reached at the checking counter after looking at my ticket the rep. simply directed me to the manager working on that day. I was informed that the flight has been cancelled from Tel Aviv from where I had my connecting flight. After all the trials and everything I was directed at the reservation counter of air India and assured that I have received the refund on profile but need to contact agent who booked my flight because amount goes back to their account. For almost an year of a try they have not initiated the refund and the reason they have is of no show? Literally there’s no other answer they have which is clearly they are lying and basically scammed me for such a huge amount?,,,,,
"  We flew with Air India on 2nd April, 2023 from Narita International Airport to Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi (India). The flight experience was horrible. It was worse than any other budget airline we have travelled with so far. The cabin crew not very responsive and often calls for them fell on deaf ears. Most importantly in flight entertainment system for most of the seats was not functional. ""Attempts"" to resolve this issue was futile. The entire 9 hours of flight we had to sit idle with nothing to entertain us. We have faced issue with the in flight entertainment system before too, with the handset on the previous flight being broken and unusable. Additionally the food was tasteless. We will surely not recommend this airline to anyone. Frankly, Air India not only failed to meet our expectations but also failed miserably to provide minimal standard of long international flight experience. (However the ground crew is very co-operative and have helped us to resolve many issues with boarding pass and baggage on this trip).",,,,,
  Service is good. Flight was on time but it’s always a case nowadays it takes almost an hour for baggage to reach the belt. Baggage service to be improved.,,,,,
" Flight from Kolkata, which was supposed to depart at 6.40 am was delayed due to technical difficulties till 11.30. All passengers, myself included, missed their connecting flights and the airline in no way gave even a shred of consideration for something that is entirely their fault. Extremely disgusted by Air India and will never fly it again. Recommend all to find other airlines which will actually reach you to your destination.",,,,,
"  Worst flight experience ever. I flew few days ago and they broke my new luggage bag handle. Easily we can understand that happen due to miss handling or brute force. I reported them then they replied to me like this happen only due to Wear and tear, Customer must pack properly, etc. I don't understand how we can cover our handle and if we cover what's the use of luggage handle. Also, what do they mean about wear and tear for new product. Now they made it like it can't be used anymore. ",,,,,
"  Very bad experience with Air india Express. My flight from Doha to Cochin was scheduled for 22.20 but ended up being delayed by more than 3 hours, causing significant inconvenience and frustration. The delay not only disrupted my travel plans but also resulted in additional expenses. I had made arrangements based on the original arrival time, which had to be hastily adjusted due to the unforeseen delay. This situation has caused a great deal of inconvenience, stress, and financial burden. The airline should have offered compensation but was not given. I have always relied on Air India Express for my travel needs, but this had made me a huge loss since I had another flight.",,,,,
"  Mostly prices are high even in non-peak times, I planned to travel May 2023 but the price was more than 1000 AED for a one-way flight from DXB-SHJ to TRZ. This is a budget flight but with a high fare.",,,,,
  I would like to express my bad experience while traveling in Air India Express flight from Dubai to Trivandrum. The flight was delay by 11 hrs and not informed to the passengers on time. Very rude behavior of ground staff during hand baggage weighing. The guy who is taking fine from the passengers who is carrying extra baggage is treating the other passengers like criminals. In the flight i asked a bottle of water for my wife and waited for 15 min and just to use toilet i need to wait a lot because of the disfunctioning. This airline is not good for travelling and don't recommend this airline to anyone.,,,,,
"  The air crew members of Flight 1X 442 Muscat to Cochin on 29.4.23 were accommodative and hospitable. Kudos to the air crew team. Especially the airhostess was very sweet in terms of remediating a seat error which had occurred at the front desk while issuing the boarding pass, and she went the extra mile by even ensuring that the restroom was good enough to be used after another passenger had used. Food was hygienically prepared and packed, and services were professional.",,,,,
" Excellent Service. Always on time. Good seat quality and leg space. Best cabin crew in response, service. Very good healthy food. Good luggage handling. Excellent take off and landing. Very good check-in assistance and best service.",,,,,
"  I boarded the flight from New Delhi to Sharjah on 18.01.2023. It was the worst experience I ever had. Not only the flight is poor but the entire staff are rude, unprofessional and uneducated. I think this is the reason they offer low cost flight and save money by hiring unprofessional employees. I believe they are trained for misbehaving with the passenger. Food was served in a manner as if they are doing some favour. I will never board Air India Express flight again and will prefer to spend more money on some good company.",,,,,
  Flight delayed more than 24 hours. The express doesn't have any back plan or they don't have any commitments to passengers. Overall poor service.,,,,,
 The flight was delayed for 24 hours and no prior information was passed to the passengers. All the passengers arrived at the airport checked in and had to wait for 6 hours before some came along with police to inform that the flight has some technical fault and they don't know when it will be fixed. Ultimately had to wait for 24 hours. No arrangements for food or water was made.,,,,,
"  Doha to Trivandrum. Not value for money. Seats very congested, very poor boarding. Always getting delayed, find insects in seat area. The toilet not at all clean. Snack provided is not good.",,,,,
"  Very worst experience with this budget airline. Hope the term budget is just used for marketing purpose, but actual cost to fly with Air India express is more than luxury airlines. I've been stopped for 1KG extra luggage, even though i had very less cabin luggage weight. Very worst sanitary management inside the plane. Crew are very intelligent & keeping a toilet separately for them by simply locking it from outside. None of the crew follow basic covid-19 protocol, no one wears mask.  2 triangle shaped (half of bread) with very salty cheese & local made sweet bun, approx.100ml/200ml water served. Leg room is very worst. This airline is not worth the money.",,,,,
"  Did not expect such a punctuality and great customer service. Blue leather cover seats, clean washroom. Onboard  services was limited but complimentary meal was served. It is value for money.",,,,,
"  I have heard about the horrible customer service of Air India Express before but have never experienced it until recently. I was flying on Air India Express from Doha to Cochin on Feb 24, 2022. At the check in counter at Hamad International Airport, I encountered the most rude staff ever. On showing my full vaccination certificate (Covishield from India with QR code), they claimed this is not the right certificate, since it only showed the date of second dose, not the first dose. (Isn't it obvious I have taken the first dose if second dose is valid?) Also, in my certificate printout, our PM Modi's picture was not printed clearly and they raised an issue stating 'where is Modi's picture? This is not authentic'. Does the airline really validate vaccination certificates based on Modi's photo rather than the valid QR code right next to it? When I tried to explain that I travelled to Doha 2 months earlier with the same certificate and had no issue, the staff told me not to argue and would not even bother listening to me. He demanded I show him the date of first dose or I cannot board the flight. Luckily, I had my laptop with me and I could access the first dose certificate in a couple of minutes. But the basis on how Air India Express staff check vaccination certificates and the way they speak to their customers is absolutely pathetic and inhumane. The staff need to be taught how to speak to humans with basic decency!",,,,,
" Such a pathetic service by Air India Express. Call center is useless, agents are unprofessional with lack of knowledge. I booked flight for 17th Dec, 11:15 PM and received a message on 15th Dec at 8:00 PM that flight is rescheduled at 02:30 Hrs without mentioning date. When I called call center they informed that flight has been postponed by a day and on 16th night I have to report to airport with pcr results. It’s so unprofessional from airline and above that they informed they can’t do anything and I have to do pcr in that limited time and get the results. Will never travel by this airline any more.",,,,,
"  What a pathetic airline. The flight is delayed and yet, they are checking in passengers, not even informing them about the delay. I mean who does that? How can you not update your passengers regarding the flight status? That's the bare minimum you need to do. Secondly, what sort of a money-making business are you in? Can't provide a wheelchair for free to an elderly passenger who really needs it? This is seriously shoddy stuff. Paying AED 110 for wheelchair assistance? I am writing this review in plain disgust. Never flying again with you.",,,,,
"  I booked this flight for my parents. But due to unknown reasons, Air India Express cancelled flight just before boarding. Nobody gave any answers regarding that. Even Airport personnel were not helpful. Because of this I had to cancel the return flight and I have not received refund yet. ",,,,,
" This was very disappointing that we had a flight on 11th November 2021 at 21.00 hours from Goa to Mumbai and we reached airport 2 hours before as per the terms. I got a message at 7.18 pm that the flight has been postponed to 22.35 so when we approach the Air India check-in desk we came to know that the flight had some technical errors and the aircraft is in Mumbai and some spare parts need to come from Delhi. Because of this the staff were not able to tell us if the flight could be boarded or may be canceled and they committed for the full refund so we processed the refund and booked tickets with Indigo for 2.20 am on 12 th and we have to wait at the airport no less than 8 hours because of miss communication or later communication with us. Air India have not shown any courtesy to reschedule our flight with very immediate or next day flight as they are claiming all upcoming flights to Mumbai today and tomorrow morning is full. My advise to every one, don’t choose Air India alliance airlines for your travels, otherwise you will be stuck at the airport.",,,,,
" Trivandrum to Abu Dhabi. I am a doctor booked the ticket one week prior to my journey online. Only requirement mentioned in the ticket was check in before 3 hours. I telephoned the customer care several times on the day before the journey, busy all the time and if we get a ring the no one picks it up, wasted almost one hour in vain. On the day I had suffered like anything at the check in. Mental stress was huge. Air India staff behavior were not pleasing at all at the airport. But on board crew the on that day were surprisingly good. My experience at Abu Dhabi airport was extremely good that prompted me to write a review regarding the customer care Air India Express.",,,,,
" Intention of budget airline was to support poor passengers, however the famous #airindiaexpress now looting their covid impacted travellers in all means and providing the worst service in the industry. Some highlights of the customer support: Cancellation charges applied for all cancelled flights at least 4500/- UAE/India sector, whereas private operators reimbursing full amount a couple of days after cancellation of flights. Rescheduling or refund request (even after deduction) not possible online, still in bullock-cart era, they claim that it is a government company unlike private agencies, they have rules to comply. Customers to call and wait for hours on unanswered call center lines for rescheduling. If you are lucky enough and get through, then after the interrogation, they will send a link where you have to pay the difference in charge, then after the payment again you have to call for rescheduling. Emails are not responded / all requests for refunds through emails are ignored. A very unhappy customer of #Airindiaexpress.",,,,,
"  How long will it take for the refund? If there are a large number of transactions and numerous refunds are pending it's not customers fault. You must plan to clear the same. Worst service I never experienced. Its been 4 month since I made this ticket cancellation. If you can't refund this amount back to customers, why did you made changes in flight schedules. Earlier your customer care agent told me that the amount will be credited in 14 working days. But till now the cash is not credited in my account. I'm really upset about your service. If you cant provide /manage services close all your services.",,,,,
"  Its been 5 months and I did not get a refund yet. My flight got canceled in January this year. I tried to contact Goibibi they said Airline not provided a refund yet once the airline gives then they can process it. I wasted my lot of time contacting Airline customer service,  many time hang up. I'll never deal with Air India again, worst experience after-sales.",,,,,
"  My seat was in the front row, flying for the first time I was nervous, but the crew made me very comfortable. They served snacks, snacks wasn't great though. And to my surprise a cabin crew came seeing my nervous face and was comforting me they gave to the meal. I will travel with this low cost carrier of India .",,,,,
"  My baggage was damaged while I was traveling from Dubai to Mumbai on the 18th Dec. I reported the incident at the Baggage counter and I was given a baggage report stating that I will be contacted within 48HRS for the repair or replacement whichever possible. Until two weeks there was no call, all the numbers mentioned on the Receipt given me were not working or Disconnected. Then after almost two weeks someone from Vilson Enterprises (Authorised Bag Repair Centre) visited and took the bag stating he will see if it is possible to repair the bag and will send a report to Air India.  It's been almost a month and until now I have no response, I have been trying to reach the concern department but the numbers at still Not in service.",,,,,
"  I have travelled in this flight dated on 28-10-2020 from Abu Dhabi to New Delhi via Lucknow. I haven't received my baggage in Delhi Airport and the team very simply states that your baggage may dropped at Lucknow. Today 30-10-2020 they are again saying that your baggage is in Lucknow and will receive upon confirmation by other team, and in next flight schedule from Lucknow to Delhi. Actually my final destination is Chennai. Because of air india express I already INR 4000 paid to indigo for express baggage and my goods will get expire. Also I don't have clothes to wear, purchasing new for survival is additional cost. And if my baggage is delivered to Chennai, to collect it I have to travel 250kms. Again travelling to collect baggage is additional expense. Overall I am losing more than the ticket amount that I have paid to Air India Express. Very poor customer service, they are very careless team. No proper response for the customer queries and simply disconnecting the call.",,,,,
  Bikaner to New Delhi. Ticket bought in the morning of the flight as the province was locking down that evening. Check in was fast and efficient. There were no problems with my checked bag being slight overweight. The flight took off and landed on time. The plane was turboprop and looked fairly new. Seating was 2x2 and there was adequate room. Minimal cold refreshments were served on the flight. As expected there was no IFE. In New Delhi the bag came off quickly.,,,,,
"  I had 4 of my family members booked with Air India Express to travel from Chennai to Singapore on 13th of Feb on flight IX688. They were travelling from mumbai to Chennai for the flight. On reaching Chennai airport at 2.30am on the 13th they were told that the flight is delayed by 5 hours. They had a connecting flight to catch from Singapore to Perth. On mentioning this the airline just said that ""we can’t help you , you will have to buy a new ticket from Singapore"".  There was no communication sent to the travelers regarding the delay as well. As a result I had to buy 4 new tickets from Chennai to Perth with Malindo. I expect to be compensated with this amount.",,,,,
" Doha to Mumbai. Excellent Service. Always on timw. Good seat quality and leg space. Best cabin crew in response, service. Very good healthy food. Good laugage handling. Excellent take off and landing. Very good check-in assistance.",,,,,
"  Sharjah to Cochin. My review is not against flight services, its about finance team. Their refund system is very bad, I have been sending emails for refund since 2 month, and customer service is responding to emails. Unfortunately finance department never replied. I did not receive any single rupee as refund yet.",,,,,
"  I traveled with my son on 9th from Mangalore to Dubai and there is no single entertainment in the flight, morning 9 am flight departure at 5.20 at evening.  In flight entertainment required and also need to increase the luggage from 20 kg to 30 kg.",,,,,
  Cochin to Abu Dhabi was a pleasant flight with smiling crew.  Snack box provided with water.  Now started to sell alcoholic drinks. Being o time is a plus for this flight. Before years back the aircraft had many common video screens. But nothing now. I suggest to available this facility. ,,,,,
"  Dubai to Thiruvananthapuram. Flight delay for 3 hour 30 mins. No A/c in flight for 2 hours, everyone started using magazine for air. Food was worst and gave only snacks (When someone paying 2000AED just to get snacks in flight. No soft drinks or juices gave. N0 Blanket give to the customers. Worst experience I ever had.",,,,,
 I booked my return ticket from Dubai to Delhi and at the time of booking the attendant mentioned that i can cancel the ticket within one week. But when I cancelled my ticket I got a confirmation for cancellation but my refund did not come back until 20 days. I called several times to customer care but no one cares to reply via email or anything.,,,,,
" This is the worst experience ever endured by me in aviation. The flight has been delayed for more than an hour and a half because of the system crash at the airport which is not Air India's fault but the way they have handled the situation is the ridiculous. None of the flight attendants answered any of the call bells or any of the questions which the passengers have. The Capt made one PA which wasn't followed by any updates. The PA said it would be a delay of 10-15 mins and now it's over an hour and half. Finally caught a flight attendant to inform them about my connection flight to which his response was that the ground staff would deal with it, worst part is that I would be stuck at the airport because of their incompetence for more than 12 hrs which is unacceptable. I don't understand how the printing of load sheet manually takes this long as I fly a 380 aircraft and have had incidents of system crashing and have never taken this long. This is plain and simple incompetence and laziness on their part and nothing else. They are not professional at all and no wonder they would not be surviving for too long. The crew have been nothing but lazy and rude. And no information has been given to us about the status of the departure. When asked a crew about the flying time, they replied I don't know which honestly baffles me. ",,,,,
"  Delhi to Dubai. Seats were comfortable and had good leg space. The air conditioning and cabin lights were good. The staff service was good. The food provided was a snacks box, but for the price we booked. its justified. Flight took off late by 50 minutes that was a disappointment.",,,,,
" Doha to Kolkata via Mumbai. Air India wasn't my first choice of airline. Usually, when looking for airlines to fly, I'm searching up and down the list of consumer-aviation from Qatar. This trip was mostly like a horror movie. The start - flight was precisely 1 hour late on 11th Jan 19 (AI9002). Was quite patient with the waiting time. Then it all started. Here’s the list of flaws: Poor hygiene in the washroom. No head napkin/hygiene cloth on top of the seat (absolutely unacceptable. Dinner - a nightmare and I must elaborate with complete respect by saying management is least bothered with regards to the quality of food, no expiry date label on the food (how could you do that. It’s simply criminal). Asked the staff and all that they have to say is “It’s our standard”. I replied “ It’s my right to know the manufacturing date and the date of expiration”. Eyebrows up and rolling eyes is all I got. Staff looked helpless as they had no answer and hid themselves behind the curtain and never came out to clarify further. It’s my right to have a great experience leave beside the money paid for the ticket. I do not expect a Qatar Airways service but at least please try and get close to them to make all happy who chooses you. Take customers seriously please. On the contrary the flight from Mumbai to Kolkata was excellent. Professional staff. Good breakfast (again label missing). Honestly this flight made some good service recovery.",,,,,
"  Dubai to Mumbai in Air India Express flight no. IX-248. The flight is a disgrace and most unpresentable flight I have ever flown with. Seating was very uncomfortable and the seats were completely worn out. The seats were not having the adequate cushioning as well since they had worn out and led to back ache. The flight condition was also not as per the standard and the floor was having marks of liquid spilled or vomit. I have usually observed that the flights bound to India are not up to the mark and will not be as per expectations, as compared to flights bound for US or London. However, this time has been worst. ",,,,,
  Dubai to Kochi return. I had a great experience. Both these days the service rendered by the cabin crew.  Air India express should improve there seats and also  include some variety in the foods which are serving to guest. And also take care about the time management. ,,,,,
"  Sharjah to Chandigarh. I was worried that the flight will be awful, dirty seats, constant delays. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Seats were clean Flight was delayed with communication in time. No further delays were done. Flight food was good and refills given (surprisingly), without a frown on face. No checks on hand luggage weight was done repeatedly. I did make sure, I was under limits. Only constructive feedback, I can give is door lock for the toilets was not working.",,,,,
"  Kozhikode to Dubai. This is the first time a boarding card issuing person asked my seating preference. And i am very very happy to hear that. I didn't note her name, but a big thank from my heart. I wish everyone does the same to all passenger whether single or with family.",,,,,
"  Dubai to Lucknow. An I don't care way of dealing with customers. The airline doesn't only charge the fare, but also everything you may ever need like water etc. Excess baggage is counted with duty free shopping.",,,,,
"  Dubai to Pune. Worst experience especially with ground staff with adamant nature. Cabin baggage were getting weighed at boarding point just few minutes before boarding. Even though more than half flight was empty, passengers were forced to pay 1 kg or 2 kg extra luggage. Whoever resisted were threatened by ground staff to off board. There is no control measures taken at Boarding pass issuing point by airlines as I was having enough scope to transfer my luggage in to check in baggage & passengers are literally black mailed at last moment i.e. few minutes before boarding time, where there's no scope left for passenger to decide. ",,,,,
"  Delhi to Dubai. Before my journey I got to know about a lots of negative reviews about the airline. But after travelling thru this airline personally it is not bad, food was good, staff was helping, aircraft from Delhi to Dubai was little bad but aircraft on return was good. Overall experience was good.",,,,,
  Chennai to Trivandrum. Many Air India Express flights are delayed by more than 1 hour and today the same happened. This is frustrating 2hr delay in boarding flight and again 30 minutes delay in getting check in baggage. Please improve your service and value customers time.,,,,,
  This is the first time I am travelling from Air India Express from Dubai to New Delhi and my first experience is bad. Firstly the flight is delayed by 2 hrs. All the crew members are talking to the passengers in Hindi. Even though my mother tongue is hindi this is really unprofessional. Flight looks very old.  My seat number is 31F. I will try to choose Air India express as my last option. I guess Air India should get privatised now.,,,,,
"  Chennai to Singapore. One of the worst flights travelled from ever! First sight experience:broken seats, torn seat covers, broken storage place,looked as if it wasn't cleaned in years!  Ugliest flight! First and last time traveling in this one. Went by the name of Air India and it really was a disappointment!",,,,,
" Dubai to Mumbai. I had a horrible experience travelling on July 4, from Dubai to Mumbai. First of, the flight got delayed by a full 6 hours and reschedule time was notified by email, just 6 hours before departure. This caused inconvenience to me and a lot of other passengers who were traveling ahead. Second, the ground staff was only shouting at passengers at Dubai airport to keep away and no explanation for the delay. In the meantime the flight further delayed by an hour. Apparently the flight did not take off from Mumbai and ground staff refused to check in passengers till it arrived! Finally we boarded after an 8-hour delay with no explanation or apologies from ground staff. They refused my cabin baggage saying the flight is ""overbooked"" a term I heard for first time in my ten years of international travel. After boarding I was shocked at the condition of aircraft. There was torn seats, no security handouts. I missed my onwards flight as well. This airline is pathetic, I would never ever book with again. ",,,,,
"  Dubai to Pune. Airline ticket cost me Rs 5500 only single wa ($80), a very low price. Checkin was on time at Dubai airport, 30kgs baggage allowed + 7 kgs handbag. Snack box water and tea provided in flight. Flight was 60% empty seats as maybe people dont like travelling with this airline. Departure was delayed by 25 minutes from Dubai airport due to traffic congestion. He apologised several times and covered the delay by 20mins on route. Overall we reached 5 minutes late in Pune from our expected time. A/C was turned off inflight in Dubai on ground for 35mins as we sat in our seat and only hot air was blowing. The A/C was turned on as we went in the sky and cooled in next 30mins. Maybe this was to save fuel on ground.  Cabin condition was really poor. Seats were old and uncomfortable. Interiors was bad.  I was afraid to use the toilet. Please avoid this airline. Looks like this airline needs private management and new systems to improve their condition. ",,,,,
" Me and my wife was travelling through Air India Express flight number XI-251 from Mumbai to Sharjah 21st April, 2018 (Saturday night). Timing for flight was 23:40 (IST) and landing timing at Sharjah airport was 01:25 (Gulf 4:00). We landed at 8:15 at Sharjah airport, almost 7 hours delay. Me and wife had work on Sunday and could not reach our office on time. In fact we took leave for that day, as we reached home around 10:30 post immigration. We lost a day of pay and included Friday and Saturday holiday also as loss without pay. Air India did not even offer for water to any passenger during whole delay. At first, Air India departed around 12:25 from Mumbai airport which was it self 1 hour delayed at departure. After almost 45-50 minutes fly, flight pilot announced that because of low fuel we have to fly back to Mumbai airport. Post announcement almost after 1:10 hrs fly we were back to Mumbai airport around 2:25 IST. We set in flight almost for an hour and many technicians came to check flight and were searching what was exactly error. By that time we all realised that there was some technical error and not related to fuel. Then 3:30 IST they allowed us transfer pass and again we moved to another gate to catch other flight. Some how they could able to manage another flight by 5:55 IST other flight. And finally, flights departed by 7:00 IST and which reached to Sharjah airport around 8:15 (GST 4:00). Really horrible experience we had ever. This was my second bad experience with Air India Express. I strongly recommend not to approach Air India Express at any cost.",,,,,
  11 passengers were not given boarding passes to board the Mumbai – Doha flight leaving on 07/04/18 at 18.05hrs. They were not allowed to board the flight and were put on a flight to Bangalore leaving at 9pm to catch the 03.45am flight on the following day 08/04/18 to Doha by Qatar Airways. The ground staff are so incompetent. It is a high risk to fly with Air India Express. We all need an explanation why this was done but there is no answer from the phone numbers.,,,,,
  Delhi to Dubai. Don’t ever book with Air India Express. Worst airline with worst attention and customer service by crew to ground staff and even customer care. Finally they took my whole money to re schedule or cancellation. Worst airline in my life.,,,,,
  I was travelling from Madurai to Singapore with my Wife and three kids (Twin infants and toddler). The crew offered no help. Me and my wife were struggling to keep the hand luggage inside the cabin.  Luckily one of the passenger after watching all this helped us to keep our luggage inside the cabin. Such a poor experience with Air India express. I dont understand why they have such a helpless and inhumane crew members. ,,,,,
" Singapore to Chennai. Worst flight, No leg space, worst seats. Nothing is proper. Any other budget airline is still better than Air India Express. This aircraft should have been retired long ago. The seat cushion wasn't any more, windows and seats all were broken, air conditioning wasn't working.",,,,,
"  I had the worst experience from Sharjah to Trivandrum with Air India Express IX-536 on 21/12/2017. My flight was scheduled to be at 20.40 hrs from Sharjah but the departure was at 6.30 am next morning. But had a delay of 9 hours and 40 minutes. They keep on rescheduling and keep on sending text messages and we're made to wait for flight. Overall I would say. This flight not at all suitable for emergency and we'll planned trips. Never fly with Air India Express, you're never sure to arrive on time. This is completely unrespectful and not honest at all.",,,,,
" Check in was extremely chaotic at both Mumbai to Sharjah. I was only checked in 1hr before departure in spite of arriving 2.5 hrs early at BOM. Air India handles Air India express check in at BOM and they were not helpful at all, more like clueless on how to handle the check in. Was hoping to at least fly on one of the newer planes. Unfortunately, on both sectors (BOM-SHJ & return), I flew on the older ones. Bringing positives in view first: Cabin Crew on both flights surprisingly stood out. All 4 or them were helpful in every way. Always received a ""Your Welcome"" when I thanked them. Another plus was the small snack box, consisting of juice, few snacks & a water bottle. Tea and coffee service was also done with refills provided, which was really nice. The crew were more than willing to offer one more snack box if requested. The seat was alright. However, coming to the negatives, the entire cabin wasn't in good condition. It gave a very old feeling. The washrooms did not have any lighting inside and it was dark if you had to use it. Overall, I would not recommend to fly with this airline as, they need to improve all areas from start to end to better the passenger experience. The crew are the only people who stand out.",,,,,
  Singapore to Chennai. Worst airline ever. Old plane bad seats. Extremely rude staff. Never go for thsi airline price go for expensive one u will regret when u fly from this airline. I will never fly again. Told me to turn off phone even when its on flight mode.,,,,,
  Sharjah to Mumbai. Air India Express is less concerned about customer importance. Their flight delays very often. Never had any issue with other airlines but this one is very risky. They keep on rescheduling and keep on sending text messages and we're made to wait for flight. Overall I would say. This flight not at all suitable for emergency and we'll planned trips.,,,,,
  My trip from Dubai to Mumbai was excellent. The flight was on time got my luggage in Mumbai on time. They had a young and efficient crew. The snacks provided were fresh and water was provided free (this is a budget airline). Dubai to Mumbai flight alcohol was served at a very reasonable cost. Return flight no Alcohol served don't know why? My return flight was delayed because of bad weather condition. I was notified on time which helped me spend 3 hours more with my family. The journey was pleasant and safe helping me have a enjoyable holiday.,,,,,
"  This was the worst experience from Calicut to Cochin with Air India Express. However, our flight of 45 min from Calicut to Cochin had a delay of 3 hours for no explicite reason except technical aspects, and we missed our 2 next flights with different airlines. Despite explaining the situation to 5 different people, nothing was done to help us, no refund or help to find new flights.  Never fly with Air India Express, you're never sure to arrive on time. This is completely unrespectful and not honest at all.",,,,,
"  We travelled on Ar India Express for the first time on the trip from Delhi to Dubai return in September this year. I will regret this decision forever. To start with, the airconditioning was not working when we boarded the plane. That made it difficult to sit even for 10 minutes inside the plane. We shuddered at the thought of spending the 3.5  hour flight sweating. Thankfully the airconditioning started once we were airborne and reached a satisfactory level in about half an hour. We were seated in the row just before the emergency exits. The pushback buttons had been crudely taken out of our seats to prevent us from pushing the seats back. There was an inflight audio entertainment system in each seat but was not functional. One could see broken edges of seat arms, window sealings etc. all over the plane. The inflight staff did not have a groomed look, the meals provided were just passable. It was the same story on the return flight. Taken a vow to never fly with Air India Express again. Word of advice: not to be confused with Air India which is definitely a better service.",,,,,
"I booked my Air India Express flight from Kuala lumpur to Chennai on 3rd Feb 2016 at 11.30 pm and I was informed at 6 pm that flight was late by one hour. Later when I reached airport, they informed the flight is delayed by 4 hours. Since I had connected flight from Chennai to Coimbatore at 6.30 on 4th Feb, I requested for assistance of staff in Kuala Lumpur - they took my data of connecting flights and promised me that alternative connecting flights will be arranged and informed to Officials in Chennai. But flight took only at 5 am on 4th Feb and it landed at 6.30 am in Chennai airport. My connecting flight had already departed the airport. When I required the Air India staff, they ran away as their duty is over and no one was there in the airport. Never seen such an experience in my life. I have to book a new connecting flight and flew to Coimbatore. ",,,,,
"The check-in staff at Trivandrum airport were excellent. However the flight was not enjoyable. The meal was basic. The cost was not actually that much lower than the other airlines. The seats were a dingy red leather. Although the staff appeared to be attentive, they did not look enthused at all. On landing at Abu Dhabi, some passengers decided to get up from their seat before the plane had reached a complete stop. They stood up while the plane was moving and the cabin staff did nothing to get them back into their seat. In my many years of travel, I had never seen this before.",,,,,
"Took this flight because of convenient timing. Check in was smooth. Surprisingly they started boarding early, more than 1 hour before flight time. Plane was only 3 minutes from the terminal. We got to the plane and thee was no AC, temperature outside was over 40 degrees Celsius (Dubai in July). Passengers were getting very restless and children were crying due to heat. They had us on the plane for a very long time and we ended up leaving late, so more than 1 hour on the plane. AC only went on properly 15 minutes after take off. The aircraft was very very old and dirty. Flight was smooth and crew was friendly. They need to use newer planes, or reconsider. People use this because of timing and non-stop route to Pune. I think if there were better option no one would go on it.",,,,,
I used travelled Air India Express back in September on AUH-COK-AUH sector. The fare was pretty much the best compared to other airlines. AUH-COK took off on time and with only less than 50 passengers on board due to off- season. The crew were pleasant and helpful. They provided snacks and even I got 3 bottles of water extra upon request. On the return the flight was almost full. Good service on time departure on both segments. Surprisingly there was not any IFE screens there. After describing the security and safety instructions the screens were turned off and folded back to the berth!,,,,,
This is a summary of several flights I have taken on AIX on the Dubai-Pune-Dubai route. These flights were at a very convenient time during the day. Now they have been shifted to the early hours of the morning which makes it less convenient though still better than driving BOM-PNQ-BOM. All the flights I have taken so far have been smooth and excellent - take-offs landings and en route. Service is generally excellent and they surprisingly serve a small snack with unlimited water. I have invariably requested and obtained emergency exit seats with ample legroom. Toilets are clean again surprisingly but smell a bit. The main thing that needs to be improved is the maintenance of the cabin. The carpets are worn and the leather seats need refurbishing. The interior of these 738 aircraft need a good scrubbing. But other than that AIX does well on this route.,,,,,
Flew from Dubai to Lucknow and back to Dubai. The crew seemed bored and the service was horrible. The table was broken and the meal served was inedible. The toilets were dirty. The seats were uncomfortable which made spending those hours on the aircraft unbearable. Choosing Air India Express was a poor choice in spite of the low cost tag attached to it.,,,,,
Apart from having point to point connection there is nothing else that this airline can offer. I flew from Dubai to Amritsar and back and found this trip rather exhausting and uncomfortable due to the airline service. Being a budget carrier does mean to save costs but its doesn't mean to keep your aircraft's dirty and unhygienic. When I entered the aircraft both the times I felt as I am traveling in one of those public buses which are disposed for public use (to be honest even public buses are well maintained that Air India Express aircraft's) the crew looked angry for no reason it felt as if they were punished to come here and serve us they did not have the decency to speak politely with passengers and just dumped their frustration on us. Food was awful as everything looked stale and had no taste. Since this was the only flight available for me to reach Amritsar I was forced to take it.,,,,,
Booked Dubai-Pune-Dubai in Jan 2014 however had to change the Dubai-Pune leg of the journey. My return journey (Pune-Dubai) was a nightmare. On arriving at the airport in the early hours of the morning I realized that my flight had been delayed for reasons unknown/unannounced to me. Then delayed 40 minutes in the security check line because other domestic flights need to be released earlier. After much delay I arrive at the final gate only to see no information displayed about my flight. Its delayed further. No one at any counter to enquire for any information. Felt relieved when the announcement to board was being made but there was more to come we were made to sit inside the aircraft as the pilots did not have clearance from ATC. It turned out to be for an hour or more until we finally were given clearance to fly. So a trip which I chose on purpose to save time and money did everything else but those two things.,,,,,
Flew Pune to Dubai and back. Flight was on time in both legs. Seat quality could have been improved. No common inflight entertainment too as airline fell short of earphones for passengers so did not distribute any. Snacks were served but were unhealthy (deep fried). Air hostesses had a stern look through the journey. Cost of ticket was very less as compared to full service carriers.,,,,,
Traveled SHJ-COK-SHJ last month. I have selected this flight because the holiday season started and IX was the cheapest available from UAE to Kochi. After my disastrous trip by Air India last month on the same sector I was not expecting much from IX but I should admit that I was surprised. Nice and clean aircraft with enough legroom polite cabin crew who were attending the passengers with a smile and on time take off and landing was part of the surprise package. And all these were for half the price of the next available airline.,,,,,
"DXB-PNQ-DXB. Check in was smooth at DXB T2 and I managed to get 1C. The plane from the inside looked a bit shabby as most AI aircraft somehow do but I was happy for the extra legroom for my 6'3"" frame. A very overweight couple took seats 1A and B after smiling sheepishly at me. The man was overflowing into my seat. I saw that 1D was empty and moved over. AIX served a flimsy cardboard box containing a sandwich a small packet of banana chips something fried and inedible and a muffin. Strange assortment but better than nothing and welcome on a low cost carrier. Unlimited water as well. Drinks are chargeable. Flight left about 30 minutes late but arriving into PNQ was a breeze and I was home in 10 minutes after leaving the airport. Check-in in PNQ for the return leg was chaotic as usual and the woman insisted my bags were overweight. I smiled a lot and finally after I removed my laptop from my hand luggage she let me go through and even gave me a reclining exit row seat. The seat bottom was worn out and the metal bar kept poking my rear. When I asked for a blanket (even a used blanket) I was told they had run out of them. I avoided serious long term damage to my tailbone by moving and shifting through the flight. Same food was served on this leg. Overall it was good value for money. But basic maintenance a word missing in India's lexicon could be better. Sitting on metal for 3 hours is no fun.",,,,,
DXB-IXE. Boarded with apprehension but quite pleasantly surprised. Reasonably clean aircraft pleasant crew and food! Not bad for a budget airline and way better than Air India (the so called full service airline). Have flown them a couple of times again on the same sector.,,,,,
I am regular passenger in UAE-Kerala route. Flights seems to be fairly reasonable compared to the fare structure and clean. Crew helpful. But the snacks to be supplied as per the timing. On mid night flights supplying banana chips and cakes really upset the stomach. Any toasted bread sandwiches (veg or non-veg) would be more ideal which will not add up the cost to the airlines. The fare calculation methods seems strange. Sometimes a person buying an online ticket far earlier before 1 or two months pays more than someone take it on the day or previous day of the flight. Also the taxes calculation. More basic fare is with less tax and vice versa. Recently the cancellation charges have been increased to 35% which is really unbearable. It should be reversed to 10% before 10 days and 15% prior to 24 hrs at least.,,,,,
Singapore to Calcutta return. An adequate performance from this budget carrier. The flights were on time the comfort was adequate and the staff generally reasonably friendly. The only slight downside was the quality of food offered in the snackbox - barely edible pastries and deep fried cookies. However the flight is only about 4 hours so having little to eat wasn't a big problem. The tickets were 50% cheaper than the only other carrier to offer non-stop flights on this route (Singapore Air) so overall I was extremely pleased with Air India Express.,,,,,
TRZ to KUL via Chennai return. The aircraft was relatively clean on both sectors. Since this was the only flight to Trichy from Kuala Lumpur I thought it would be more practical to just take this flight since there is no hassle of getting out into Chennai. However the transit procedure in Chennai is terrible. We had to get on bus queue up till everyone got off the plane and go though security check again. For the price you pay the service is not at all worthwhile.,,,,,
I paid INR 13000 on IX flight from Kolkata to Singapore compared to about 21000 in SQ. The aircraft was clean crew reasonably friendly. They served snacks on the flight. I would say if they keep the aircraft clean and maintains time it's good value for money. I would have to fly few more times to see if they are reliable!,,,,,
Used IX for a domestic flight from BOM-COK. I have to say for the fare I paid I was not expecting much. A spotless aircraft and a hospitable crew. Overall a very average airline which offers value for money.,,,,,
My third flight on IX (from Dubai to Cochin) and quite possibly my last. It appears that there is no cabin maintenance at all. Most seat cushions badly soiled - as if the plane had been used to carry livestock. No paper or cloth covers for the head rests. Carpet in a filthy and lamentable state throughout the cabin. At first I thought the window I was sitting next to was covered in a layer of condensation. I then found out it was a film of grease and grime with the window frame covered in a brownish substance containing lots of human hair.,,,,,
Air India Express from Cochin to Dubai on 25/11/05. Aircraft quite new and thanks to being seated in one of two emergency exit rows lots of leg room. Despite travelling on a low cost airline you nevertheless are served a snack consisting of sandwich cake fruit juice water coffee or tea. On the downside the passenger next to me was allowed boarding in a clearly less than sober state and the crew continued to serve him hard liquor throughout the flight (alcoholic beverages available on a for sale basis). He even managed to complete the entire flight without ever having availed of the seat belt. Also despite being a non-smoking flight crew were quite relaxed at seeing the lavatories being used continuously as smoking rooms - with the obvious and objectionable result of extremely bad air quality in the cabin throughout the flight.,,,,,
"  Milan to Male. Nice airline. Very good in all services. Economy class is a very good class. Beverages are very good too with a lot of product. On my flight services were 3: snack, lunch and a afternoon snack with a slice of pizza. If you need something else you can ask to steward that will help you in every moment. Staff is very kind and happy. Good airline.",,,,,
"  Munich to Bologna and Pisa to Munich, both on an Embraer 195, economy. Both flights handled efficiently, southbound on time, northbound delayed by about 25 mins on departure due to to late arrival of incoming flight (there had been thick fog at MUC early that morning which had sent things adrift for much of the morning). However, support given to those with tight connections. Modest in-flight service - snacks and drinks - wine came in proper glasses. Air Dolomiti worked okay for us.",,,,,
"  My flight Catania to Milan was 2 hrs late and when we arrived no one from Air Italy was at gate to help us to catch our flights to Miami which we missed. No one at transfer desk. Doors locked to floor for check in desk. Security would not help. We were told flights would wait but air Italy did not. It took many hours, even business class, to secure cheap hotel room far from airport. They would not even give me seat or ticket for flight next day. When we got To this hotel, their restaurant already closed. I finally gọt seat the next day with no apologies. WiFi not free for business class.",,,,,
"  Verona to Mahon. Flight at full hour, aircraft slightly dated but maintained better than others, very comfortable seats. In mid flight we were served a very good snack. nice and elegant and above all professional hostesses. volo in pieno orario,aereo leggermente datato ma tenuto meglio di altri, sedili molto comodi. a metà volo ci è stato servito lo spuntino, molto buono. hostess carine e eleganti e soprattutto professionali.",,,,,
"  New York to Catania via Milan. We flew business class on the way over on this trip. Service was okay. Food was not great. Upon arrival, despite having 'priority' tags on our bags my bag never showed up in Sicily. There was no way to contact anyone at Air Italy and they only have 1 person who manages lost and found bags. No compensation or return upgrade was offered. I had to spend every day trying to track my bag and spend money to replace things. A complete waste of precious vacation time. We arrived on Saturday afternoon and I didn't get my bag until Thursday afternoon (we left Italy a few days later). When I inspected my bag I realized they cut through 2 sections of the bag even though there was a TSA lock and I gave them the code. They also went through my belongings for no reason (my original tag with name and information was still attached). Everything was just shoved back in haphazardly. It was also impossible to get a hold of anyone on the phone (used the US toll free number), you wait on hold and then the system hangs up on you. They really had a negative impact on my vacation and cost me a lot of money.",,,,,
" Although my original flight from New York to Palermo was on time I was not impressed with the staff nor the plane itself. The staff were rude and not friendly at all, instead it seemed we were more of a nuisance rather than paying customers. On our flight home we were delayed over 3 hours and we were never informed prior to arrival at the airport. This delay led us to miss our connecting flight to New York. Although issues may arise with the planes the way they handled the situation was unprofessional. Once we arrived in Milan they gave us little direction on where we needed to go in the airport and we wasted an hour trying to figure out what we needed to do next. The airline put us up in a hotel and said we would leave the next day at the same time. At the hotel they provided us “dinner” which included dry pasta, processed chicken, mush for green beans and potatoes. When we asked for more sauce for the dry pasta they refused to give it to us unless we paid for it. ",,,,,
"  We arrived at SFO Air Italy desk to see staff was just standing around and talking, it was as we where inconveniencing them. I was trying to ask questions but they would over talk me and not take the time to listen to my questions. I just gave up on asking about our seats. Worst customer service ever. On our flight, the attendants stood in the back galley talking. This is not an airline I will be flying in the future.",,,,,
"  Flew Business Class from Milan to New York. Worst Business Class I have ever experienced. We were made to stand for one hour before boarding and the gate agents were never advised by the Captain that the flight would be delayed as the plane had to be cleaned! The board stated that we were leaving on time though this was clearly not the case. All they had to do is post a new departure time instead of leaving the original departure time on the board. I suspected something fishy in Cagliari when I noticed that 2 of their flights to Milan were over one hour delayed. Fortunately we flew Alitalia on this route. The food was awful except for the pasta dish which was served lukewarm. The seats were not completely flat but this did not bother me. The Purser insisted that everyone on the plane put their shades down though this was a day flight. The whole economy section was in the dark! He kept on putting my shades down without my permission. When I told him no the 3rd time as I was reading he told me to put the light on. I insisted on keeping half of one shade up. Their Dining on Demand like on Qatar and Etihad is a joke! They don't follow the time you request to eat and even forgot the desert. If they can't do it properly don't do it! The steward got angry with my travelling companion because she fell asleep between the hour we asked to wait for the entree after we had finished the appetizer. He had to reopen her tray table and the tablecloth had fallen to the floor. Seats are not fully flat but this did not bother me. The economy class legroom looked awful too. Clearly a 2nd rate unprofessional operation. Inflight entertainment was very limited and the music / audio pretty bad. OK they give pajamas but quite frankly I never wear them, especially on a day flight.",,,,,
"  New York JFK to Rome via Milan. First: Ticketing Counter: Very inconvenient counter locations at the airport, the farthest counter from everything, around the corner and hidden behind all other counters that you actually have to ask someone to locate. By the way, they do not affiliate with Air Italy. First I thought it was just at JFK but to my surprise it was the same setup in Rome. Seems like they picked the cheapest counters at the airport. Second: Leg Room: Let's start with tight seats with no leg room, they do not meet the standard requirements. Once the seat in front of me is reclined, I literally was trapped and could not get up. I could not even close the food tray that was jammed on my lap. Wanted to reach out to flight attendant for help but obviously couldn’t reach out the overhead help button. No one walked by for hours until dinner time, but even then she was not able to help. As if people in economy do not matter at all. I understand that they have to treat upper class customers better but they cannot ignore economy class to that level. Third: Baggage Fee: No charge for luggage from US to Rome but they hit you with 'No luggage allowed' policy for economy unless you pay 100 euro each. As if it’s not the same bag came on the flight in to Rome. Why charge only one leg of the flight? When I refused the pay, they referred me to the supervisor who finally showed up after half an hour but was not helpful at all. In fact she was extremely rude and pretty much said to us “this the way it is whether you like or not”.",,,,,
"  My flight was to Milan from Toronto and return. Check-in was fast, the crew were polite and efficient on the ground and in flight. For the most part both of my flights were on time, just on the way back there was a delay of 2 hours but Expedia had informed me through e-mail 2 days prior of my flight. I was pleasantly surprised regarding the meals served on board to and from Italy, not only you can choose from a menu but the food was delicious! Also I found that choosing the option to pay for checked baggage on Air Italy site was much cheaper than paying at the airport, I paid in Canadian dollars instead of euros. I usually fly with Air Canada but Air Italy was much cheaper in comparison. The only thing that I would appreciate is that when choosing the option to pay for my checked bag online that it would indicate ""1 checked baggage included"" at time of booking. The flight was smooth and very pleasant. I will definitely fly with Air Italy again in the near future.",,,,,
  Milan to Palermo. We paid extra for an assigned seat only to be told no seats were assigned and we could sit anywhere vacant. Staff at check in and boarding gate vague about reasons. I’m trying to claim back the additional money we paid via their online claim form. It is very user unfriendly and keeps asking for a claim form number. Extremely frustrating,,,,,
"  Milan to Sharm el Sheikh in September 2018. We flew Air Italy 737 Max 8 before it was grounded, on 2 business class tickets. The seat pitch was so small, that even the length of an Ipad could not properly fit. I complained with the airline, and  was offered a 100 euro credit, which i refused. I was asking instead for a credit of the difference between coach and Business, for two passengers. On the Milan to Sharm el Sheikh flight back in September 2018. and while the seat was slightly more comfortable, with a few extra cm of pitch, the pitch was probably the same to the one in the economy section of the cabin.",,,,,
" Toronto to Naples via Rome with Air Italy. A very nice experience! The cabin crew were probably the most professional and friendly that I have experienced in many years. Completely bucking the trend of surly, and cheap service that most airlines seem to be offering now-a-days. The aircraft was modern, clean, and comfortable - plenty of leg room! The meals were excellent with nice snacks and fresh beverages. Even the entertainment was very good. The airport personnel wer also very efficient and friendly - altogether a very good flying experience!",,,,,
  Milan to Toronto. At Milan Airport you have to stay in a line which moves very slowly to get your boarding pass. If you like to check in online I believe you have to pay a fee.,,,,,
" New York JFK to Milan. I flew Air Italy for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The customer service was outstanding. My cabin attendant was fantastic. Anytime, I requested something or asked a question, she was patient, knowledgeable and most kind. Normally, I fly business class but was not available since i booked my flight 2 days before departure. I felt like I was in business class minus the bed. Also, the first officer introduced himself to me and told me to ask for him if needed anything. I have never had a pilot introduce themselves and offer their assistance, that's first. Hats off and well done.",,,,,
"  Los Angeles to Milan, the seat was ok though still cramped. Fortunately the flight was nearly empty and I got to rest my legs on the seat next to mine. The food was good, but I found the flight attendants were a little unprofessional.",,,,,
"  Los Angeles to Milan. Customer service great. Both by telephone thanks to the excellent and patient Mrs Nardina who helped me get all the information regarding my special assistance. I also wish to commend the treatment received at Malpensa airport by Air Italy Supervisor and staff assigned to check in, who distinguished themselves for their kindness, speed and determination in managing my problem, being the undersigned disabled at 100%. As did the check-in attendant at Los Angeles airport. Same treatment for the return. In my numerous flight experiences with different airlines, I had never received similar treatment. I add to what I wrote the great availability, kindness and desire to work of the aircraft crews, in particular the steward. Really top. Servizio Clienti meridiana air Italy Ottimo. Sia telefonico grazie alla bravissima e paziente signora Nardina la quale mi ha aiutato ad avere tutte le informazioni inerenti la mia assistenza speciale. Ci tengo inoltre a elogiare il trattamento ricevuto all'aeroporto Malpensa da parte del Supervisore Air Italy e la signora  addetta al check in, che si sono contraddistinti per la gentilezza, velocità e risolutezza nella gestione della mia problematica, essendo il sottoscritto disabile al 100%. Così come Mrs. Sharmilla addetta check-in dell'aeroporto di Los Angeles. Stesso trattamento per il ritorno. Nelle mie numerosissime esperienze di volo con compagnie aeree sempre differenti non avevo mai ricevuto un trattamento simile. Aggiungo a ciò che ho scritto la grande disponibilità, gentilezza e voglia di lavorare degli equipaggi degli aeromobili. Davvero top. ",,,,,
"  
Milan Malpensa to San Francisco. First time I've flown Air Italy, quite a nice experience overall. The main topic they need to address is the web site, which, at least in December when I booked, was sometimes slow or not working in all areas. All the rest has been good, with on line check in easy, bag drop very efficient, seat comfort good in pitch (but with 2 IFE box close to your feet if you travel by the window), good food and very nice cabin crew. I'd surely fly them again.",,,,,
  Milan to Bangkok. They appear to me to be a no frills Business Class. Food is poorly presented and attentive service non existent. One of the crew on the return leg was quite rude and uninterested. Upon boarding I walked past him and turned right towards economy but there are one row of business there in between the galley and economy. My locker was full of crew bags. I walked back to inform him there was no space and he said “surely not”. I stood for minutes while he continued to mess about with trays and eventually came with me to investigate. He got a shock when he realised I was a Business Class passenger. My short list of what I feel is not in keeping with a proper business product. Staff attitude. 2) Food quality and presentation. Movies very limited. No fast track cards issued for Bangkok Immigration. WI-FI not working. Lounge in BKK pretty poor and lunge in MXP worse.,,,,,
"  Naples to New York via Milan. Air Italy lost my suitcase and the customer care was impossible to contact. I called the number 078952600, they transfered my call and never answer, I tried to call back and they picked up and hang up right away. This is shameful! Customer care on facebook was handled by automatic responses and was telling me to do the things I had already done. Even if the flight was good overall, such a treatment has to be condemned. I will never fly Air Italy again.",,,,,
" Milan to Dakar with Air Italy. Both flights were on time on new B737MAX8, seats were narrow and if the next seat was occupied you felt cramped. Legroom was 30in, we bought expensive LXseats (2 rows after business + 2 rows by exits). No IFE and for 6 hour flight could be a problem, our flight was a red eye one so we slept all the way. Service was professional and food was plenty and tasty. Overall a good experience.",,,,,
"  Milan to Bangkok return in business. A332 from Qatar Airways are very well mantained, clean, super silent. The flat bed seat is very comfy also mattress is provided together with full pajamas and slippers. Food top quality. Cabin crew service was fantastic, so professional polite and dedicated to their job. It's evident all staff is really looking forward to the new Air Italy brand and expansion project so they are fully customer oriented. I'll fly with them again in the future.",,,,,
"  Miami to Cairo via Milan. I purchased through Orbitz Economy Premium for my trip with them. My ticket said that I can check-in up to two luggage and I will have priority boarding. When I got to the airport I was denied to check in two luggage even though both of my luggage were under 50 lbs each and that my ticket said that I can check two luggage. The Air Italy staff told me that they have a policy which says that I can only check in one luggage if I am heading to Cairo.  After waiting for more than 40 minutes, the head of staff came in and let me check in my two luggage and said to me that there was a confusion about this. There were no apologies for the delay. During boarding, I went and staying in the priority line but the staff started checking in regular economy before they got to us.",,,,,
"  Miami to Cairo via Milan. My bags got delayed on the way there and on the way back causing me a lot of inconvenience, had to go out and spend money that I did not plan on spending buying clothes. I had to make a special trip to Cairo Airport to pick up my suitcase as they don't deliver, had to pay a taxi to the airport and back, paid for a hand cart in Miami to hold my luggage which was a waste as none of my luggage arrived.",,,,,
"  I was drawn to Air Italy via an internet fare special $368 round trip from New York to Rome via Milan. The flight from Milan to Rome is currently operated by Qatar Airways aircraft. I purchased my ticket along with my daughter and her boyfriend. All flights, both directions, operated on time. Service was good! On the flight over, dinner and breakfast was service. Wine, cocktail, juices, coffee, tea, etc. On the return flight from Italy, lunch and snack, along with the above mentioned beverages. The short 1 hour flight from Milan to Rome served a beverage and sandwich. The sandwich was better than the one I purchase at the Milan airport. Leg room was about equal to most airlines. You are allowed a carry-on bag 18 lbs max and a personal bag. Note: the carry-on bag will be weighed at check-in. I had my carry on bag and backpack (which wasn't weighed). However, if you plan to shop it will be best to purchase the ticket option that includes 1 checked bag. If you don't it will cost $50 each way prior to departure; which isn't expensive in comparison to the other airlines. Sidebar: Milan and Rome airport have more shopping choices than eateries.",,,,,
" New York to Milan. Good flight, clean and tidy aircraft, poor IFE and bad headphones. Good meals but with a poor presentation. Friendly staff, with some ups and downs. They have to improve in some places in order to balance the best competition.",,,,,
" Flew Air Italy from Milan to Rome. Wonderful new airline with brand new airplanes. Cheap tickets, but great service on board. Even got a complimentary drink and snack. Very comfortable seats with adjustable headrest, even on our short flight. Also one of the cleanest airplanes I have seen.",,,,,
"  Milan to Moscow. Worst services ever. Their online check in didn’t work for me. Tried to pay online for the bag couldn’t do it as well. At the airport paid 50 Euros, instead of 25€ online. Said that if I won’t pay I won’t fly. ",,,,,
"  Milan to Miami. From the outside the plane looks cute with it's paintings and markings. On the inside the plane has an old musty smell. The pillows were decent but the blankets felt like they just shake it off and fold. The seats are small, narrow and cramped. They do have a great selection of movies and tv shows and even have live TV available. This would be great if the movies and shows had subtitles in English because the headphones do not work. I asked for another one and was told it's my last one. You can only hear from one a ear bud and the sound quality is very bad. To start the staff hands us a ripped menu. The options were beef or vegetarian. When they get to us they had run out of beef. I am adamant that I don't want anything. The staff said the gnocchi is good and he likes it more than Beef, and that I should give it a try. I relent, only to hear him tell the guy behind me that there's a special menu - mushrooms with polenta. Why wasn't this offered to us as well? The gnocchi did end up being pretty decent, but was the only thing edible on that try. Their appetizer was what I think was a tuna salad, I found the bread horrible. They serve coffee after meals. The staff gave me a stern look when I asked for a cup of water and a cup of soda. They also served gelato during the flight which was not bad. And the last meal was a slice of pizza with a brownie (pizza was decent but brownie I found disgusting. Bathrooms were standard but kept clean throughout. Check-in was fairly easy, I just checked in online but I did not have to check in any baggage so I can't comment on this.  No delays and flight arrived an hour earlier. This made me happy and was the redeeming quality of this flight.",,,,,
"  Accra to Milan, the flight was fine. The Accra flight comes via Lagos, and it must be one of the cheapest ways to fly from west Africa to Europe (250 euro one way, no bag). The flight was only 50% full at most, at check in I asked for, and was given an exit seat (which you would normally have to pay 70 euro for), and as there was a clear row of four seats near the back so I moved after takeoff and slept for most of the flight. The service and food were fine. No in flight entertainment. Cabin staff were pleasant (mostly Italian) and were happy to bring extra water when asked. The Boeing 767 was 20 years old, and showed its age, but it flew on time. I wrote this review to counter all the 1 star horror stories - now that Qatar have invested in the airline hopefully some new(er) planes will start running the Africa routes.",,,,,
"  Flight from Milan to Dakar at 9 am. The day before the flight I tried to get a boarding pass online through the web site but it would not work. We arrived at the check-in desk at 7.32 am, only to find it deserted. We went to the general ticketing office of Milan Malpensa Airport where a kind lady told us that for flights to Dakar the check-in closed 90 minutes before take-off and that no Air Italy staff was available as they had all moved to the gate. I checked my ticket but this information was nowhere to be found. Only with the help of this lady could i find this information in a sub-section of the Air Italy website. The lady told us we had missed our flight and nothing could be done (the plane was due to leave in over 75 minutes by then). She told us to try and contact the Air Italy call centre (2 euro per minute) and see if we could get on the next flight which would leave 3 days later by paying a penalty. I tried to call but after a few minutes of recordings I just gave up given the high cost of the phone call. More people with small children arrived just after us for that flight and no one was offered any help or could speak to any Air Italy staff member. In the end we had to buy a ticket with another airline leaving on that same day. I was appalled by the lack of any form of assistance or of clear communication (they should have mentioned that the check-in closed at 90 minutes on the ticket). Never again will I fly with Air Italy.",,,,,
"  I booked a flight with Air Juan in March 2019 with departure date on the 2nd August 2019. The airline then informed me about the flight cancellation on the 31st July 2019. They offered me options of rebook, refund or travel credits. I chose to have a refund and got the form to fill in. I sent the filled from back on the 1st of August 2019. Then it took 27 days from the airline to reply and they then promised the refund within 65-70 business days. Now I have contacted the airline once again on the 28th January 2020 and they replied that my refund is still in queue.",,,,,
"  Do not book with this airline. It is a complete scam. Flights are regularly cancelled hours before the scheduled take-off for ""maintenance"" and then a refund is never given. My wife and I were left scrambling to arrange alternative flights and we have not received any refund after 9 months of waiting. If you look online you will find hundreds of similar reviews.",,,,,
" I was in Manila and had only 2 days to go for diving. I've chosen (close by) Puerto Galera and since my time was limited I booked a flight with Air Juan. They cancelled my flight approx. 10 days before my trip and sent me a request for reimbursement to fill in. I sent back the request on 18 April! Recently they stopped replying to my follow up e-mails. I booked a flight with another Manila-based company, they also cancelled but sent me back money in a couple of weeks. It is worth mentioning that I also lost the payment of 1 night in a very nice hotel there since I was unable to travel by car/bus and ferry (limited time).",,,,,
"  
Busuanga to Caticlan. No refund after flight cancellation The flight was canceled allegedly due to aircraft maintenance. It was pre-paid by credit card and Air Juan offered me a refund. I sent them the refund form but I never received the 7,900 PHP back.",,,,,
"  In March we booked our flights with Air Juan for the month of May with 400 Euro and paid the same. Two days before the first flight came an Email with cancellation due to problems and the safety of the passengers go. A few days later came the cancellation that the return flight was also canceled. At the request to refund the money we only got standard emails. This tactic is annoying and so we threatened with a complaint to the aviation authority and appointed a lawyer. Then we switched on our bank immediately after arrival in Germany. Over a complaint with the credit card we got now after 3 months our money back again. We never received a message again with an apology from AirJuan. Thousands of tourists are cheated out of their money by Air Juan's tactics. Many tourists either do not answer at all or do not know how to get their money back. During our holiday in El Nido, Bohol and Cebu we met 8 tourists who also got a cancellation one day before the flight. So stay away from this airline. Then better with Philippine Airlines"", AirSwift or Cebu Pacific.",,,,,
"  Caticlan to Busuanga. Our flight booked months before (october 2018) was canceled one week before departure due to ""aircraft maintenance inspection"". They sent us a document for the refund request, stating that the amount would be refunded within 35-40 working days. The canceled flight was scheduled for the 16th february 2019, today is the 24th june 2019 and nothing has been refunded yet! I keep sending them emails every week, and every email I send, they always reply in the same vague and useless way, stating that ""they will contact the involved office and will send a copy of the transaction once available"", which never arrives! I will be forced to send people directly to their office in Manila in order to be able to get my 13,000 PHP back, just for the canceled flight!! Where I live, since it is the airline's fault, they should have even provided an alternative way to get to destination and provided the extra night in the hotel we had to spend!! These people really don't know how to treat their customers.",,,,,
"  Manila to Puerto Galera. Air Juan gave me by far the worst experiences of airlines ever. On my first flight 2017, they managed to forget my luggage -on a 3 passenger flight! In January 2019 I booked 2 tickets for a return flight to PG. On March 11 it was rescheduled, on March 29 it was cancelled. To this very day I have not received the refund of PhP 20k. I keep writing, Air Juan keeps dodging. Broke? Lazy?Incompetent?  I warn everybody of booking or flying with such an unreliable operation!",,,,,
"  Manila to Puerto Galera. They cancelled the flights 4 days prior to departure, and despite my several requests, I have never been refunded. Do not fly with this company.",,,,,
"  This airline cancels flights on people if they can sell the seat for more money. They cancelled both my flights because I had purchased the tickets as a ""Super Saver"" price. I have followed their procedures and policy's but they have stopped replying to my emails for a refund, 122 business day later. The last email was ""It's with the accounting department and they will process the return shortly"". ",,,,,
"  Booked a flight from Manila to Puerto Galera in October 2018. Informed days before that that flight had been cancelled due to routine maintenance. If routine then why the unexpected unavailability of the aircraft? Was given the choice of a refund or credit towards another flight, so opted for credit (silly me). Re-booked for a Puerto Galera to Manila flight in March 2019 (and had to pay an extra 1,000 pesos for the privilege). Days before that flight it was also cancelled for - you guessed it - routine maintenance. This time I opted for a refund and after filling out and returning the form was told it would take 25 to 30 working days to process. 40 days later, I'm still waiting for my refund. After numerous emails, the response to which was always a copperplate 'your refund is still in process' I contacted my bank for a charge-back, only to be informed that the 90 day expiry had passed already. So tough luck. Total scam.",,,,,
"  Don't book with this airline. They may cancel your flight last minute and leave you scrambling to get a flight out through other airlines. Refund has been on process for more than 2 mos. Haven't returned the Php33,000.00 refund until now. I will never recommend this carrier to anyone.",,,,,
"  Manila to Puerto Gallera. Avoid at all costs. I've booked three times with these jokers and every time they have cancelled the day before the flight. They claim maintenance as the reason for the cancellation but after three incidents I decided to look into it and it appears as though they are selling already sold tickets at higher last-minute rates and then cancelling passengers that booked in advance at better rates. The last time I wanted a refund, they refused unless I signed a bunch of legal documents that would waive all my rights. I refused to sign and I'm still waiting for a refund.",,,,,
"  Cebu City to Siquijor Island. Very unreliable airline. They cancelled our flight two hours before departure. The money paid has not been refunded so far, more than 6 weeks later, after their own set deadline!",,,,,
" Puerto Princesa to Cuyo. Looks like a fraud airline. First my flight delayed by 2 days, later delayed again by day. In the end we did not fly, had to arrange a ferry lost 2 days of holidays. Worst thing is that we are still waiting for a refund that is already way after deadline",,,,,
"  Puerto Galera to Manila. I purchased my ticket 4 months in advance and got the ""Super Saver"" rate. The night before the flight, Air Juan emailed me and informed me that the flight was cancelled due to ""extended Aircraft Maintenance Inspection"". I later found out that the flight did go as scheduled. I can only assume that Air Juan sold my ticket for more money and cancelled my ""Super Saver"" ticket. I had to take a bus and boat to get to my destination. On the return flight, Air Juan re-scheduled my flight from 1:00pm to 8:10am. Again, the flight at 1:00pm did depart. I can only assume they had an empty seat on the 8:10am flight and moved me as they can sell the 1:00pm flight for more money. The plane and pilot were very good on the return flight. Don't buy a ""Super Saver"" fair and expect Air Juan to honor it!",,,,,
  Flight cancelled. Cancellation after check in. Bad weather! Sipalay hotel confirmed weather quite good. Only 4 persons on flight. All of us were thinking cancellation because of lack of enough customers. No compensation at all. We all lost 1 night in Sipalay and had to book a hotel in Cebu. Air Juan is a very bad airline.,,,,,
" Subic to Manila. Not reliable in the slightest. I've flown 5 flights, 3 of which have been cancelled. When they cancel a flight you wait 30-45 days for a refund. This one is the last straw. My buddy booked a flight for us from Subic to Manila. The night before they changed the flight from 6:30 to 8:10 departure. Flight was delayed until 8:52. If we had just taken a taxi and left at 6 am we would be almost to Manila by now. So we've spent over twice the amount of money and saved 0 time.",,,,,
"  On October 18th we booked 2 roundtrip Manila Puerto Galera paid with Master Card. On October 22nd, Air Juan sent us an e.mail to inform us that our flights were canceled. They offered to refund us and confirmed that the refund should be between 25 and 30 days after this confirmation. This delay is already inadmissible because we learned that the day of booking, they had the perfect knowledge that the flight would not be possible. So they cashed the money illegally and, to date, they still have not refunded us. You might think a temporary problem. It is not so. A friend who wanted to visit us ended up in the same situation. While Air Juan no longer insures seaplane flights since October 20, according to the Manila station manager, last week they booked 2 passengers and 2 days later canceled their flights after collecting the ticket prices. ",,,,,
" Busuanga to Boracay. I cannot recommend this airline based on my experience with Air Juan. My flight was cancelled, and instead of coming and telling the passengers they left us sitting for hours in the very hot airport terminal until eventually we had to go back through security and ask what has happened at their desk. They told us the flight was cancelled and said we have to go back again through security and tell the other passengers. They then refused to pay for the hotel that we had booked at the next destination which lost us money due to their error. This is not acceptable. Furthermore, they then booked us into a very cheap hotel in the local town and the replacement flight the next day was delayed. We lost 2 days of our vacation due to sitting in the airport and were left out of pocket for the hotel. Overall a disappointing experience.",,,,,
"  I didn’t take any flight of Air Juan yet, I was willing to take, however, my first booking was an one-way flight from Manila to Puerto Galera, it was cancelled because of bad weather condition, they gave us option either rebook another flight without extra charge or refund. I rebooked a flight back to Manila from puerto galera as my option. However, I was cancelled again with the excuse of bad weather condition. I was disappointed not to have a seaplane experience. The more frustrating thing happened later was the process of refund. They promise us to get the refund within 25-30 working days. However, today is the 30th working day excluding weekends and Philippine holidays, my refund has been processed at all. The Customer service is really bad because anytime I was trying to email to ask for some updates, they would reply with exactly same reply without any updated explanation for the process of refund, basically they would just tell you to wait and say that they would make sure to expedite my refund process. The negative impression for Air Juan was not from the flight experience, mostly from their customer service which is not accountable and useful at all. For now, I even don’t know I can get my refund back.",,,,,
"  This airline doesn’t even deserve a single star! It is a very disappointing and unprofessional airline! We booked our tickets,3 of us from Puerto Princessa to Coron on Jan 2 2018 and had everything paid from accommodations to our activities in both cities. But airjuan totally wrecked our vacation! They cancelled our flight due to the technical issue as they said in a peak season.  Our nightmare in this company didn’t end there. They have given us the option to refund our money and give us a flight credit. They told us that the processing will take 20-25 days but it is already on the 32nd day today yet we haven’t receive any words from them. We sent emails for an update but no one from their team replies.",,,,,
" Flight was a little delayed, but pilots were courteous and apologetic. No problem at all. Great view over Calamian Islands, and then Northern Palawan. Got into San Vicente airport and was greeted by pretty ground staff. Flight was comfortable despite some bumps. Normally I am scared in small planes but pilots and plane were reassuring.",,,,,
"  Air Juan is really like a scam. On 31 Aug 2017, I was due to fly from Caticlan to Coron. It was a sea plane with 8 seats. There were 3 passagers on the list told by the ground officer. Finally only I showed up. After I arrived at airport at 10:45, I sit and wait for the ground officer. At 11:10 I cleared all the security check to proceeded to the gate 2. Waited for 1hr, my flight was supposed to be departed at 12:00, but no flight showed up. Then at 12:30 the ground officer told me that the flight was cancelled due to the bad weather. The ground officer then helped me to call the head quarter of Air Juan. They said due to the bad weather in Manila, the flight was cancelled. Then I took Air asia to Manila, and I found that the sky is clear and even the staff of AirAsia said that the weather in Manila was fine.  I believe that due to the few number of passengers, Air Juan cancelled the flight. it was a disaster for me, because I booked an expensive resort in Coron. And the airline is just make me disappointed and make me angry after I found out the truth in Manila.",,,,,
"  
Yangon to Nyaung. My wife and me flew three routes with Air KBZ over our holiday in Myanmar and we got outstanding service every time. The cabin crew all have excellent presentation and are very courteous and attentive. We had a cold snack, tea and coffee, all of which were very tasty, on all flights. Its unusual to be given cream cakes at 8.30 am, but they were very nice. All aircraft used were very clean and in good condition and all flights departed and arrived exactly on time. Air KBZ is way better than we expected.",,,,,
  I took the flight K7-708 from Mandalay to Heho to get to Inle Lake as it is the quickest way to get there. This was my first time flying with Air KBZ and it was a pleasant flight. Check-in and boarding was very efficient. The flight left Mandalay about 10 minutes before the scheduled time and arrived about 15 minutes earlier. The cabin was very clean and seats were comfortable. Cabin crew were friendly. I will not hesitate to fly again with Air KBZ.,,,,,
"  Yangon to Mandalay. Really good flight, the seating was 2-2 and actual seat numbers given on boarding pass, plenty of space even at 6'4"" inflight catering offered, light snack and good coffee. Nothing to worry about despite ATR aircraft type and would definitely fly again.",,,,,
"  Heho to Yangon. Another very good flight same ATR aircraft, no seat numbers given but all very easy boarding. Plenty of space, 2-2 seating and inflight snacks given with coffee or Tea. One member of crew not happy but not the end of the world. At 6'4"" I had no problem with the seat space in fact better than many European airlines.",,,,,
" Flew RGN-SNW, arrived at the Yangon Domestic Terminal an hour and a half ahead of the flight. Check-in was smooth, received my passenger identification sticker and waited in the restaurant. Boarding was via a bus from the gate to the aircraft. The plane was an ATR-72 and seating was done quickly. Flight was full. Aircraft left on time and boxed refreshments and tea/coffee were served soon after the seatbelt signs went off after take-off by well-presented aircrew. Flight arrived on time and on disembarking, after clearing immigration, received my bag within half an hour and was out of the airport. Return flight SNW-RGN was slightly less orderly with three Air KBZ flights leaving within 45 minutes of each other. Seating area was full in the lower floor of the departure terminal so went up to the top floor and sat out on the deck to watch the planes landing from the seaward direction. Once on board the ATR-72, flight was smooth, again received a box with sweet buns and boxed juice in, and tea/coffee served. Flight arrived on time again and bags were slightly delayed at Yangon. I was impressed with the service throughout and would fly again.",,,,,
" I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of Air KBZ flying from Yangon to Mandalay. I bought the ticket just two days before the flight and the fare was very reasonable. Check-in was fast and efficient, and a Air KBZ employee approached me in the line and escorted me to the check-in desk and helped me check-in. The domestic terminal is small and a bit chaotic, but this is not Air KBZ's fault and should be remedied when the new domestic terminal is finished. There are no screens announcing that boarding has commenced, so you have to pay attention to the airline employees who walk up and down the waiting area with hand-held signs with your airline and flight number on it. Boarding was via a bus to the aircraft. The plane was clean, in good condition and the seats were comfortable. The flight crew was helpful and friendly. We were served a light breakfast on this 80 minute flight. The flight took off and landed on time. I would certainly fly Air KBZ again.",,,,,
"Yangon to Thandwe and pleasantly surprised by Air KBZ. Snacks served onboard – seats generally comfortable. Organisational issues with boarding and a slight delay in departure from Yangon. Check in at RGN was not very organised, however, once inside the departure terminal - ground staff were more helpful. They give you a coloured sticker to put on your shirt to ensure you get on the correct flight. Would use again.",,,,,
"We recently took 4 internal flights on AirKBZ during our holiday in Myanmar. They use mainly ATR72 500-600 aircraft for these flights. They serve a snack and a drink on flights longer than 1 hour, on shorter flights boiled sweets are served. The planes were newish and in reasonable condition. At every check in you are given a sticker to identify your destination, once onboard these stickers are seen on the backs of every seat and safety cards. FAs were professional and pleasant. The schedules were punctual, as the turnaround time on hopping flights is well under 20 minutes, some of the flights left before time as soon as all the passengers were on board!",,,,,
"I had not heard of Air KBZ before I made the booking for my Myanmar trip. However, all of the three domestic flights (Mandalay to Thandwe, Thandwe to Sittwe and Sittwe to Yangon) went very well: on-time arrivals, food and beverages free of charge although the flights were short, friendly staff, modern and clean aircraft. I would fly Air KBZ again in case I return to Myanmar.",,,,,
"  Pyongyang to Vladivostok. Clean classic aircraft with amazing engine sound. Seats were a bit narrow, but okay for a flight of around one hour and ten minutes. Cabin staff was friendly, sandwich and lemonades, water were provided free. Excellent experience.",,,,,
" Beijing to Pyongyang. Comparing an intra-European flight of 2 hours and this flight, practically no differences: clean aircraft, nice stewardesses, punctual, simple food, good and attentive service, a normal standard.",,,,,
"  Aircraft clean with immaculately presented and polite cabin attendants. Seat comfortable with great leg room. Flights on time. Inflight entertainment consisted of North Korean military type music. Food was a cold burger with a choice of water, coffee, tea or soft drink. ",,,,,
 Everything went smooth from Pyongyang to Beijing. Check-in staff were friendly. Seats were comfortable. Inflight entertainment could have been better. Food and drinks decent enough.,,,,,
  Pyongyang to Beijing with hot/cold drinks and a hamburger which was adequate for length of flight. Very polite and welcoming service. Efficient check in and boarding. In flight entertainment limited to a video of recent North Korean hits. Pyongyang Times and Korea Today  available to take on board.,,,,,
" Pyongyang to Beijing with Air Koryo. The departure and arrival were punctual, staff smiling and friendly, the aircraft, including toilets, was clean and there were magazines and newspapers at the entrance. The food was a chicken burger but the drink selection was rather limited, either water or one type of soft drink. It is maybe not the most luxurious airline but the service for a short-haul flight is better than European or American airlines I have used for the same distance.",,,,,
"  Beijing to Pyongyang. The aircraft was clean, cabin crew friendly and the flight on time. You get the Pyongyang Times to read aboard. I flew for the first time this type of a Tupolev and found not much difference to some other aircraft. The food was acceptable. The selections of beverages could be better.
",,,,,
"  It is absolutely unfair to give only one star to this airline: the Tupolev plane is in good condition and perfectly clean, the crew are efficient, pleasant and helpful, and last but not least, it is always on time, you can find many airlines much worse than that, for instance Air China on the same route. The route flown is the no. 1 route of Air Koryo linking DPRK to Beijing, and this entitles you to some patriotic videos on the overhead screen. The buns served are not too bad, and drinks are acceptable for such a small trip. All in all, a good experience.",,,,,
"  I don't know how things were in the past, but there is no current reason for a one star review. Flew from Beijing to Pyongyang. From a comfort perspective, Air Koryo was just like any international economy class seat. Yes, the inflight entertainment for the 2 hour flight was basically North Korean propaganda and magazines from North Korea - but surely if you are a tourist to North Korea that is exactly what you are interested in. In fact, you'd probably prefer that to say Big Bang Theory episode re-runs. The food was average. The service was perfectly passable.",,,,,
"Beijing to Pyongyang. The Tupolev 204-100 aircraft is as comfortable as many that are flying around the US. The check-in experience was quick at Beijing and Pyongyang. The crew were friendly and smiling during the flight. The ""burger"" was quite tasty and I got a beer with it. Baggage quickly delivered at both ends.",,,,,
Beijing to Pyongyang with Air Koryo - kind staff. A passenger had some health issues and at Beijing airport a medical team waited and was informed about the problem. There was Korean cartoons and short movies. Food and drinks served was OK. Flight was were on time. Aircraft was clean.,,,,,
"There is no Air Koryo Business Lounge benefits if you take its red eye flights. The staff of VIP Lounge was in a hurry to get off work refusing me entering it at Pyongyang Airport, although it's not very late and only two fights would take off at night. Food and beverage of Business Class is as same as Economy Class. The beverage service is so poor that only has tea, coffee, beer, water and fruit soda.  Cabin staff Chinese is fluent so communication in that language is smooth. However, they don't pay attention to safety and cabin service detail at all. No one required passengers should power off cellphone, they don't check seat belt and or ask to return your seat backs to the upright position, which is common sense. Cabin staff weren't willing to ask passengers if they need blankets, even if there are blankets in the plane. What made me surprise most is there was no food the whole plane and it only one drink for us! Overall, Business Class of Air Koryo is not worthy of its price. The only real distinction between Air Koryo Business Class and Economy Class are the cabin seats.     ⚑ Air Koryo Ranking",,,,,
"I make quite regular trips from Beijing Capital to Pyongyang Sunan, and I cannot reconcile with your latest reviews here!?  I belief that safety requires staff to be able to communicate in the international English language, and that is still very poor for Air Koryo. None of us can truly speak for their maintenance, but from local standards in other industry this will be a continued concern for some persons. The food is best left alone which I now do - Air Koryo  supply outbound and inbound flights from Pyongyang, and cuisine standards there are certainly not the best. I think many my fellow ""foreign"" travellers are more interested in flying Tupolev airplanes or checking if N Korea is really people say - best of luck with that. But this is not airline you would choose if there were more operators to choose. Guess that's not going to change in the near times!",,,,,
"If you compare Air China with Air Koryo, there is a lot to be said for Air Koryo. New uniforms for the stewardesses, friendly faces, good beer, lousy food, clean plane, reasonable seats and good old-style music.",,,,,
"PEK-FNJ-PEK in August 2015 and a seamless experience. Both flights on time. The seat was comfortable with sufficient legroom. The TU-204 aircraft is only a few years old and the interior was clean and tidy. There was a free drinks service including local beer. Their famous Air Koryo burger was a very tasty snack and I would have eaten another. Cabin crew were very courteous. All in all, a very pleasant experience.",,,,,
I flew PEK-FNJ at the start of my holiday in the DPRK. I had a bit of trepidation flying on North Korea's state airline but was pleasantly surprised. The Tupolev was smart and modern and the plane was new. We had a reasonable amount of space and the staff were smartly dressed and friendly. The food was a burger with a mystery meat inside which was not very nice and I did not finish it. The air ticket was part of my holiday package so I do not know what it cost.,,,,,
I was flying from Beijing to Pyongyang with a Tupolev 204-300. The aircraft was in an excellent state and the service was very friendly. The flight departed and arrived in time.,,,,,
A timewarp experience to say the least my flight from Beijing to Pyongyang was without hitch although you'd be hard pressed to find a team less interested in not only the well being but the safety of the passengers. For example when the purser was meant to make the safety announcement she looked around and saw a flight full of foreigners. As a result she actually shrugged rolled her eyes and sat right back down instead of briefing us. That it was a 30 year old Tupolev made that nagging feeling of 'I should probably listen to the safety announcement in case I jinx the flight' all the more pressing. That said the flight was a dream. The plane felt so heavy we barely realised we were touching down. The food was passable but the experience was unforgettable. Our seats tilted forwards rather than backwards. But for a 2 hour flight the sense of wonder far outweighs any actual discomfort. The stewardesses seemed more interested in reapplying thick strata of foundation and redoing their 60s overdone hairstyles than actually serving their passengers but the sight was certainly more entertaining than the sad slightly desperate propaganda movies played throughout the flight. My Air Koryo flight was a tremendous start to my trip.,,,,,
"PEK-FNJ return in the newer Tu-204. Check in at PEK is fast and agents seem blind to overweight/over size baggage (not mine but many others). The plane is clean and seats are comfortable with very good pitch. FA's served water apple juice and a North Korean greenish carbonated drink (soda) and the ""hamburgers"" that were brought in from FNJ. The plane departed on time and arrived into FNJ early. The plane was parked out on a taxiway and all pax were bussed to the terminal because the terminal is under construction. All arrivals and departures were handled in a temporary terminal and can only handle one flight at a time. Fortunately there are only 4 flights a day. All 7 immigration booths were open to handle about a plane load of 150 passengers. Luggage arrived about 20 minutes after we arrived at the terminal. Return FNJ-PEK was on the other Tu-204. Check in is quick and easy. I requested a window seat and got one. Again the terminal can only process one flight at a time. We had to wait in the public area while they handle an earlier flight to Vladivostok. Once the pax for that flight boarded the bus we cleared security and checked in. Check in is quick and again I requested a window seat with no problem. All pax then were bussed to the remote parking site and boarded the plane about 30 minutes before scheduled departure. The flight left 5 minutes early. Inflight experience was similar to the last flight PEK-PNJ. This flight was originally scheduled to use a smaller An-148 but was switched to a larger Tu-204-300. The plane was about 80% full.",,,,,
PEK-FNJ-PEK 12-19 August 2014. Departed and arrived on time on both flights good FAs and great seats. Interesting airplane (TU204) and very likely the first and last time I fly a Russian built plane (not a lot operated where I spend most of my time). Flight to North-hard and bumpy landing. Back to Beijing was good - not so many turns and much smoother. Once we arrived in Pyongyang immigration took 10 mins and bags were delivered immediately. I'm glad it all went well.,,,,,
18 May 2013 PEK-FNJ JS 152. 25 May 2013 FNJ-PEK JS 151. Not as bad as expected. Standard level of service modern aircraft (Tu-204) similar to 757 or 320 series not any worse when comparing with some airlines of Europe or Asia. Aircraft and interior were in mint condition on time service no problems at all.,,,,,
I flew from Beijing to Moscow on a charter flight last month I was pleasantly surprised with the service and the joy of flying on a TU-154M. I was in business class and found it to be just fine the entertainment was a tad basic but the food and cabin crew were lovely. I would have no hesitation of flying them again.,,,,,
"Flew FNJ-PEK last week. Handling on ground smooth and efficient accepting a couple of kgs more weight than allowed without even a question aircraft clean and modern service friendly and with a smile both on the ground and in the air. Ok catering and a good choice of drinks given the short leg of just 1.5 hrs flight time. On time flight. I guess the bad rating comes from the ""old"" Air Koryo operating but since a while both their equipment and their attitude has changed strongly and it's another carrier now.",,,,,
On both legs (Beijing - Pyongyang - Beijing) the plane was a more than decent TU 204 with a reasonable seat pitch. Check in fast and efficient both at Pyongyang and Beijing: check in staff also turned a blind eye of a 2 kgs excess I had on both legs. This airline is an experience in itself: propaganda is on air during the whole flight with DPRK music. Complimentary inflight service with local both soft and alcoholic drinks. Deplaning at Pyongyang fast with rapid baggage delivery: in less than 30 minutes I was on my way (escorted by guides) to the hotel.,,,,,
Beijing (PEK) to Pyongyang (FNJ) return 22-24 August in economy. PEK to FNJ was on a newish and very clean two class TU-204 with decent seat pitch in economy drop down inflight entertainment and efficient service (economy bulkhead is row 4 first exit row with extra legroom is row 7). Catering consisted of the infamous Air Koryo 'hamburger' containing some kind of mystery meat and a choice of alcoholic or soft drink. Inflight entertainment consisted of clips from classical music performances and the obligatory state propaganda about the DPRK. Although there are headphone sockets none are given out (music plays throughout the cabin). Smooth landing but long taxiing time in Pyongyang. FNJ to PEK was on an older one class TU-204 with slightly less legroom but the service was the same - short propaganda piece inflight music and catering with the dreaded Air Koryo 'hamburger'. FAs are reasonably efficient if a bit robotic with adequate English skills (better than China Eastern for example). Quick check-in procedures in both Beijing and Pyongyang. Requested (and given) a window seat on both flights. No issues with luggage although baggage delivery in Pyongyang is painfully slow (allow 45 minutes or so waiting time). Overall a decent effort. The 1 star classification is unjustified - based on my experiences Air Koryo is somewhere between 2 and 3 stars overall. Catering and safety procedures need to be improved - tray tables were down and cabin baggage blocking access during take off.,,,,,
Honestly can't fault Air Koryo - their 1-star rating is completely unjustified. I've had worse flights on Malaysia Airlines Turkish Airlines and British Airways. I flew PEK-FNJ on a modern Tupolev-204 and both check-in and boarding were faultless. We departed on time and the cabin crew were courteous. Free food and drinks were served and the safety demonstration was very professional. Once we arrived in Pyongyang immigration took 10 mins and bags were delivered immediately. I'd definitely use them again.,,,,,
PEK-FNJ on their brand-new Antonov An-148. Courteous and professional cabin crew served a lavish hot meal with several different savoury items in little plastic dishes - fish chicken salad plus a main of chicken curry plus dessert bread roll tea cider or beer. Landed on time and formalities to enter North Korea went very quickly. FNJ-PRK on their Tupolev Tu-204-100 wasn't as smooth boarding started early but a small hitch checking in a passenger with an oversize bag halted check in for over half an hour while staff dithered. This resulted in a departure an hour late which wasn't made up in the air and I missed my connection to the US necessitating a 24h stay in Beijing. Since I was originally only going to be in transit and not enter China Air Koryo's PEK staff had to rebook me before I could enter China which took about an hour. The change fee I incurred on my flight to the US was £300 of which Air Koryo contributed $100. Delays happen but this one was so easily avoided. Will definitely fly Air Koryo again as they are a very interesting airline compared to the competition (Air China) and have a vastly better onboard product but will be prepared for the odd burst of eccentric behaviour such as this.,,,,,
Not as lucky as the last writer here. Travelled on an ancient Ilyushin aircraft and whilst happy to reach my destination this is not an airline I would use again (no choice this time on my schedule to Pyongyang). This plane was not maintained well from the surface appearance in the cabin and many seat mechanisms also were broken. Cabin staff had a fixed smile on boarding and whilst they gave out a meal tray they could not speak or understand English and appeared to rather poorly trained. Food was as expected I guess but the quality was well below all Asian airlines I have ever flown and think it was the cheapest meal ever sampled on a plane.,,,,,
Flew a total 8 sectors between Beijing Pyongyang Chongjin and Sondok onboard IL-62 IL-18 Tu-134 and Tu-204. Flights were all on time. Good English spoken onboard and a full meal service on 1.5 hours between Beijing to Pyongyang. All baggage delivered promptly with no delays. Planes are maintained well.,,,,,
Only flew internal flights (3 legs) on AN-24. Drinks (beer or cider) provided on the 2 longer legs. No IFE. FAs spoke reasonable English and were friendly. No safety demonstration and the overhead bins were just overhead shelves. I like the way you can push the empty seats all the way forward (so they lie flat) in a half-empty plane it's a good option for more leg room! There is no choice flying domestic in DPRK but Air Koryo provided good entertainment.,,,,,
Flew Beijing-Pyongyang (IL-62M) Pyongyang-Samjiyon return (Tu-134) Pyongyang-Hamhung return (IL-18) Pyongyang-Beijing (Tu-204) as well as 3 other flights on their An-24RV IL-76 and Mi-8 helicopter. I was on an organized aviation tour and we had not one problem on the whole trip. While all but the Tu-204 were ancient Soviet aircraft they were in immaculate condition. Every flight left on time with most arriving ahead of schedule. The crew's attitudes varied from flight to flight with some being better than others. Food was only given out on the international sectors and I must admit was revolting. IFE was also extremely poor and only available on their two Tupolev Tu-204 aircraft. All they showed us was a North Korean concert which was on a loop. While it didn't bother me too much on our 2 hour flight from Pyongyang to Beijing it would have driven me insane if I was flying to some of their other destinations such as Kuala Lumpur or Bangkok.,,,,,
SHE-FNJ-SHE in Economy class. On the way to Pyongyang it was an old aircraft check in at Shenyang airport was smooth and check in at Korean air counter. Boarding was fine staff on board helpful and friendly. Due to the air conditioning the cabin was full of fog. There was a lot of condensation. No food for 1.5 hours flight to Pyong Yang. Check in at Pyong Yang was easy because there were not many flights at all. Departure and arrival are sharing same hall. One room for everything but very efficient. On the way back to Shenyang was new TU204 very modern aircraft. Food was served (a hamburger). Would recommend for the experience of the old aircraft (one off experience). I would fly again with the new aircraft in the future.,,,,,
Beijing to Pyongyang return. The plane was clean and well presented. Check-in service was impersonal but satisfactory. The food was good. Both flights left and arrived right on time. A shame the airline doesn't fly more routes.,,,,,
FNY-PEK as part of an organised tour. The aircraft used was one of the newer Tupolevs. Good points. Check- in assisted by our 'minder' ensured that all luggage went through with no problems. Seating was better than some other aircrafts flown food - although only a snack was more than adequate for a short journey (and provided free). FA's were efficient and any reasonable needs were complied with. However the IFE consisted of the same propaganda film shown in the airport and must have been on an endless loop. The flight left earlier than my agenda showed although we got there in ample time I was not notified of any change. We were advised that there was no Business Class - there was and for most of us this would have been the preferred option. Overall I believe Air Koryu is a reasonable airline to fly and would not hesitate to use them again.,,,,,
I flew Air Koryo as part of an organized tour in and out of DPRK planes were new TU204s. The planes were clean and plenty of overhead luggage space crew was pleasant and efficient food okay for a short flight. The overall experience was better than some airlines with 2 and 3 star ratings.,,,,,
Beijing to Sunan International an experience to fly their IL-62 it was back in time. Food was good and service efficient. As North Koreans travel with lots and lots of baggage it was placed all over the plane. Plane on time in Sunan but waited more than 1 hour for our baggage.,,,,,
PEK-FNJ New TU204 seats relatively comfortable service friendly meal standard economy meal. Pyongyang Times and Korea Today newspapers which keep first-time DPRK visitor busy for the flight.,,,,,
"PEK-FNJ on Tu-204. Check in quick and efficient at PEK. Clean new aircraft seating reasonably comfortable and adequate for 2 hour trip. Was served bland meal but no worse than many other economy class meals. Service was efficient but cold drinks offered and free English language DPRK ""literature"". Entertaining pre-take off video with politics included and inflight video showed happy images of the DPRK. Quite reasonable flight noticeable that all non-Koreans were in the front economy cabin - with the back cabin full of Koreans. Pre- take off and touchdown were marked by the happy playful music of an electronic band eerie but very much part of the DPRK experience. I was pleased to land given the safety reputation.",,,,,
PEK-FNJ-PEK in business class on new Tu-204. The seats were quite spacious and airplane comfortable. I thought it really odd that they served a huge meal PEK-FNJ but only bread on the return. The flight attendants were decent enough though English skills were lacking. There was access to the Air China lounge at PEK T2. I didn't visit the lounge on the return at FNJ. On the flight PEK-FNJ there were no more seats so a North Korean teenager sat in the flight attendant jump seat for the whole flight. On the way back the security guard sat in the flight attendant jump seat and she sort of sat on the very edge of the same jump seat and held the wall for take off and landing. They also kept the curtains closed to the front of the aircraft which in the event of an evacuation would be a no-no because people couldn't see to get to the exit.,,,,,
PEK-FNJ. Interesting to say the least. Outbound was oldest plane I have ever seen in my life (Il-62) and literally falling apart at the seams. Propaganda handed out announcements regarding how this flight was made possible by the dear leader etc. Return was same aircraft type but much better shape. However upon landing in Beijing was quickly sweating due to no air conditioning. Not like you have much of a choice when flying to Pyongyang - snag Air China if you want a safe flight but Air Koryo if you want the experience.,,,,,
PEK-FNJ on old Tupolev 154. Professional if solemn crew but decent flight and lots of food.,,,,,
Round trip PEK-FNJ. New Tupolev plane. Service inflight entertainment and food excellent. A clean and comfortable plane comfortable seats and professional flight crew.,,,,,
Beijing to Pyongyang and return and could enjoy the new Tupolev planes of Air Koryo. The business class is very small (8 seats but comfortable with good seats). Stewardesses attentive entertainment is miserable and so is the food. Anyhow the Tupolevs bring a huge improvement to the image of Air Koryo.,,,,,
I took a round trip of Beijing to Pyongyang - Il-62 and Tu-154 aircraft - and the experience was to say the least memorable. As I was sat quite far back in the Il-62 it was right next to the engines and I'll never forget the feeling of impending dread and doom as we descended down to Sunan Airport. We landed safely. The food was satisfactory with chicken curry beef with rice some melon-esque vegetable bread and dessert. Seats were nice but it was slightly cramped. The luggage space was limited and there was no cover to prevent it from falling off. There were North Korean magazines and a North Korean newspaper (Pyongyang Daily) up for grabs too on a meal cart. The return to Beijing was on the Tu-154 : sitting a few rows behind Business class the flight was very comfortable. We did feel hungrier this time as there was no food service coupled with delays hovering over Beijing due to busy traffic at the Airport.,,,,,
PEK to FNJ roundtrip on Ilyushin 62--The flight was only 1.5 hours. Aircraft was very old-looking and used. I had to work hard at attaching my safety belt. The fabric on the seats was old and frayed. The crew was very perfunctory in their duties but still polite and civil. The crew was not service oriented nor did it seem inclined to be. Not a bad experience but nothing to standout in my mind.,,,,,
PEK-FNJ FNJ-SHE. Beijing to Pyongyang on Tupolev 154 very old plane revolutionary marching music played before take off and before landing. Attentive service meal on 1.5 hour flight - food a little processed but edible. Return to Shenyang on Ilyushin IL-18 - by far the oldest plane have flown on and was very happy to land! Food was a sandwich containing undentified meat but quite tasty. Both flights unique and a great way to start/finish a trip to North Korea.,,,,,
I was fairly disappointed by the service however was amused when both pilots came around to say hello to the dignataries with me presumably leaving the aircraft on autopilot anyway! Made the journey exciting I can tell you.,,,,,
Short flight of about an hour from Beinjing to Pyongyang you get a comfortable seat and every manner of food and drink - food is not 5 star but it's not bad and more than you can eat. There's reading material (P'yang times) and flight attendants are reasonably helpful and polite. Aircraft are old Soviet ones but there is ample room. The lavs are impeccable.,,,,,
I have travelled on Air Koryo frequently for almost seven years mainly between Beijing-Pyongyang and occasionally Shenyang-Pyongyang. Flights are usually on IL-62 sometimes on TU-154 or TU-134. On one occasion on an IL-18 from Vladivostok to Pyongyang. During the 'SARS period' in 2003 when flights to China were suspended Air Koryo arranged several flights to Bangkok. The IL-62 has a reputation of being a very safe aircraft. Air Koryo pilots are most capable especially in Spring when high winds and duststorms from China are experienced. Once our flight to Beijing was unable to land due to strong winds and diverted to Tianjin for 2 hours. Air Koryo is generally punctual even departing Pyongyang (Sunan Airport) on time in snowy conditions. The flight attendants are charming but loose luggage in overhead racks (not closed bins) is of some concern to passengers also the quantities of additional hand baggage carried on board and stacked up loosely in the rear of the aircraft. The meals referred to by other persons are only served on the inbound flights to Pyongyang. Outbound flights serve hamburgers and soft drinks and beer; occasionally coffee or tea. There have been comments about the lack of safety announcements. Indeed the PA system is hardly audible. Only once do I recall was there a demonstration of the use of life-jackets as we flew over water from Vladivostok to Pyongyang. This flight takes place at night which is a little scary ! Seating in the TU-134 is very cramped (for tall people) and most uncomfortable. Flights on the TU-134 have been my least pleasant experiences. Air Koryo has been unspectacular but generally reliable with 3 outbound flights weekly (currently) to Beijing 2 to Shenyang and 1 to Vladivostok. Am smiling at the prospect of direct flights to Yanji (China) also the proposal to initiate a Frequent Flyer programme !,,,,,
PYO-AMS-JFK. I was lucky enough to be on this exeptional flight. It was definitively not a routine flight but a special flight with respect to the deputy-minister foreign affairs of DPRK visiting the States. Safety procedures were good this once as well as the inflight meal services. There's even rumour of a Koryo frequent flyer program to be started shortly (which is interesting for me as a frequent visitor of DPRK).,,,,,
Flew Beijing to Pyongyang return on an Il-62. Some wonderfully nostalgic touches including dry ice and folk music in the cabin that gave the flight a cool '60s feel. Flight was full as the Thai football team were on board. I think one of the engines may have been inoperative but otherwise the flight was fine. The meal in fact was larger than most other airlines I have flown; the crew were courteous and extras such as confectionary and magazines were all provided. Safety procedures common on other carriers were obviously not adhered to such as crew walking around collecting trays as we came in land! Along the runway in Pyongyang you can see the shells of other planes which have obviously been cannibalised to ensure that at least one stays on the air. All in all I would recommend Koryo to anyone who doesn't necessarily regard safety as a priority in their air travel.,,,,,
Koyro PEK-FNJ Ilyushin IL-62. The inflight product was great however their safety standards are in need of international review - no cabin crew jump seats are provided - they hang on to assist handles in the galley curtains are drawn for take-off and landing exits blocked with service carts no cabin baggage storage checks and the safety demo is a seat belt only. Also pax are assigned exits to use in an emergency depending on where they are seated - and I'm sure the FA's will want to see your boarding pass as you jump down the canvas apron slide!,,,,,
Beijing to Pyongyang on economy - the airplane was an Ilyushin 62 quite roomy business class is separated from economy via the galley which one walks through to get to the back of the plane. Service was excellent the food was ample and more than enough for a one hour flight; fruit a green curry with rice fine-tasting North Korean beer. Air Koryo compares to my mind more than favorably with other short haul sector airlines. I can definitely recommend Air Koryo.,,,,,
"Beijing to Pyongyang return on an Il-62 in economy. On the outbound sector the most beautiful cabin crew I have ever seen (all female). The meal although huge was of the horrible processed type. 70s style interior with sick bag stating ""for your refuses"" hmm. Amusing to see the crew hanging onto the galley for dear life on take off and landing! On the return due to the amount of passengers an additional service was laid on (Tu-154) leaving half an hour later. Overall one of the more interesting short haul sectors to fly.",,,,,
Rigolet Labrador to Goose Bay Labrador on 13 October 2013 on an Air Labrador twin Otter. Aircraft has been well used over the years but provided a comfortable and quick way back to Goose Bay. Bush flying co-pilot loaded and unloaded the bags seating - well- wherever there is an empty seat. No complaints about the service and would not hesitate to fly with them again.,,,,,
" I had a great experience flying with Air Macau yesterday. Was surprised that other reviewers have rated them so low. In particular, their reservations team were really helpful when we had problems with our travel agent, travelgenio. Our original flight was cancelled by Air Macau 2 weeks before departure, which was annoying but they offered us a selection of four alterative flights (via our travel agent). Our travel agent then gave us the wrong rebooked flight details. We therefore didn't turn up to the airport for the flight and we looked like a no show to Air Macau. Travel agent took no responsibility for their error and we were worried we would have to pay for a new ticket. However, a quick call to Air Macau customer services and they rebooked us onto a flight the following day for no extra charge. Brilliant! Departure experience: There was a bit of a queue at check in but not abnormally long. 1.5hr flight included a pork roll, cookie and water which was a nice touch. All the staff were friendly too. I suppose one downside was that there was no inflight entertainment and electrical sockets, but that didn't bother us on such a short flight. I would definitely fly with them again.",,,,,
"  Hangzhou to Macau. I have had the misfortune of flying Air Macau numerous times over the past 6 years. On virtually every occasion the flight has been late, often by at least 2 hours. The airline has the annoying habit of boarding passengers first, and only then informing them of the delay, creating a long and frustrating wait on the tarmac. The Macau - Beijing route seems particularly liable to delay, but recently I have travelled on Air Macau to Hangzhou and Nanjing and both flights were 2 hours+ late, with little or no explanation. Air Macau gives the impression that it simply does not care. After many years of international travel, Air Macau is quite simply the most unreliable airline I have ever had the misfortune to fly on.",,,,,
"  Beijing to Macau. Air Macau is the only one carrier operating 3 daily flights from Beijing to Macau. The aircraft they use on this route is A321. The flight attendants can speak English well, but the service do not have any shining spot. Dinner is provided on this flight, which tastes not too bad. Although the plane delayed for 30min to get airborne, due to traffic of Beijing Airport, the flight made landing 10min earlier than estimated, which surprised me.",,,,,
"  Bangkok to Macau with Air Macau. Check-in in BKK was painful. The line was long and extremely slow moving. Check-in staff in BKK seemed busier chatting / messaging on their cellphones. The agent who was checking us in was unpleasant and unprofessional. She was busier message chatting on her phone when we reached the check-in counter. She didn't know the dimension of cabin baggage yet tried to deny my IATA cabin certified carry-on. Then, she started ""lecturing"" my 67 years old mother and I on Macau immigration requirements, imply us as potential over-stayers. I am an economist at an international organization and I travel on a monthly basis for work and leisure; I used to work in the air transport sector myself and I have lived in 6 different countries and I am very well informed with immigration requirements.  Finally, we only receive our boarding passes after the involvement of check-in supervisor. On the other hand, kudos to check-in personnel at MFM. Check-in was a breeze - the line was fast moving, and personnel were friendly, helpful and efficient. No personal IFE on board; seats for both ways were very uncomfortable; food was average but only water was offered. Flights were slightly delayed both directions. In-flight attendants were a mix bag, some were very enthusiastic and passionate while others provided minimal service.",,,,,
"  No pre-flight selections of seats. All seats have to be assigned upon checkin at airport counter in Macau and in Bangkok. This procedure takes forever and so time consuming. Flight experience on the return trip, Bangkok/Macau was horrific. The flight was scheduled for 9:50 pm but was delayed for at least an hour. Was warned that this airline on-time performance is terrrible and it sure is. In addition, cabin temp was too hot making it impossible to breathe. Never again will I fly with this airline. A full fare airline that is performing worse than a budget airline. AirAsia far better. ",,,,,
"  I used Air Macau for a round-trip from Tokyo to Narita. I was able to get the tickets for a quite low price, so I was not expecting much from this airline. At the end, I was able to get a fair flight from them, but there were still some issues that made my journey inconvenient. The thing that bugged me was that some items in the cabin seemed to either have issues or was non-functional. One of them was the tray tables. It was mandatory for me to use it as both of my flights included 1 meal. But, whenever I try to place my food tray on it, it keeps sliding towards me. It was quite annoying at the time. Also, in one of my flights my seat recliner was broken. Despite the poor maintenance, the cabin staff was very friendly and helpful on both of my flights.  Overall, Air Macau is a minor airline and passengers shouldn't expect much from them. If you are a person that doesn't mind the poor condition of the plane and want a straight flight to Macau, then I would recommend this airline to you. If not, then I would rather suggest taking other flights heading to Hong Kong and using the ferry from Hong Kong to Macau.",,,,,
"  Macau to Chengdu. My debut with this carrier, check-in at 1000 for noon flight, staff said flight will be delayed but didn't know exact departure time, and said will notify me once confirm. Wait until 1500, receive SMS that flight departs 1700. Finally I decided to cancel my trip. I like to say I book through their site, air fare is standard fare which is not value for money, for a national carrier their ground staff and services seems like budget airline. The staff are not initiated and not intended to compensate or apology. Regret to choose this carrier and highly not recommended!",,,,,
"  Hanoi to Macau with Air Macau, and not very impressed with cabin crew and safety procedures. I fly a lot and have used many different airlines. It appeared that the staff were not interested in doing their job properly. The passenger in front of me never put on his seat belt once, (take off and landing included) and not one member of staff checked or asked him to do so. The woman in the isle seat next to me had 3 bags which she held on her knee and at her feet, a flight attendant came to answer her question about how long the flight would take, but negated to request the passenger to put her luggage in the stow compartment during take off and landing. Some seats remained reclined during decent. I will mention (and this may reflect on the airport) but once we were off the aircraft we were put onto a bus to take us to the gate, as the door opened there was a lot of pushing and shoving from passengers to be the first one off and through to passport check. I had to hold onto a rail so that I would not be pushed over. I have never experienced anything like this.  This airline could much better if improvements are made in regard to the above.",,,,,
"  Shanghai to Macau with Air Macau. My flight NX135 was supposed to depart at 16:40. I got to the airport at 15:00 and I was told that the flight was delayed because the airplane was still in Macau. So at least 3 hours delay but they had no idea when the plane was flying to Shanghai and also no idea why it was still in Macau. At the gate, the staff told us it was due to ""air traffic"" and ""weather in Guangzhou"". In the end, we boarder at 23:30. I spent 8.5 hours at the airport. When I came back, I was told by my friends and colleagues that this is very common with Air Macau, thus I am sure I'm not flying with this airline anymore.",,,,,
"Round trip between Bangkok and Tokyo/Narita with layover in Macau both times. Each of the four flights were delayed between 10 minutes and an hour and a half. Not a single on time departure on my trip. This airline seems to a have its pilots climb and descend very rapidly. There are economic advantages to this type of flying but it can be uncomfortable on your ears. Cabin temperature inconsistent, hot at times and cold at times. For food, ""fish rice"" was the only option on one of the legs, the other also had a chicken and rice meal. I am 6'4"" so very sensitive to seat pitch. I thought the seats were OK for the shorter flights but couldn't handle them for much longer. Aircraft's are older A320 and A321s that could use a refurbishment. We got a good price for these tickets so I will say the value wasn't bad.",,,,,
"We were on Air Macau flight from Osaka to Macau in the winter. The weather in both Osaka and Macau were very cold at the time, yet the cabin temperature was almost 30 degree Celsius. It was so hot that it was unbearable. Several passengers reflect the issue to the flight attendants yet nothing was done. It was like sitting in the baking oven. It was the worst 4 hour flight I have experienced. There were apparent difference in temperature between front section and rear section of the cabin (much hotter in the front and mid section). Maybe that's why the flight attendant who were staying in the back did not take passengers' request seriously. Cabin temperature is so important for passenger comfort and so simple to correct, it should also match the weather condition of the departure location. ",,,,,
An hour late leaving Taipei. Plane seating was very tight but ok for me. Staff immaculate and very polite - probably this airlines saving grace. Food was hot but a bit bland. Couldn't hear hostess or pilot on the intercom. Return flight was ok smaller airbus but seating adequate. Again food was nice and hot but I had to ask for tea which should be served after meal. I didn't expect too much from an hour and a half flight but they could supply headphones and music. Also both flights were serviced by steps NO air-bridge - surely this wouldn't affect pricing too much would it? Overall fair for the price but some attention to detail needed.,,,,,
ICN-MFM on old A321. Seats are old styled and very tight. Service is outstanding but meals are poor. No various beverages for their serving as well. Captain spoke English very well. A321-200 is too narrow between seats and aisle however quite ok for me. For my next trip if the price is right then I may use this flight again.,,,,,
My wife and I recently flew MFM-CTU in business class. The flight departed Macau 40 mins late with no explanation offered to passengers. Once onboard A320 the polite though business like crew assisted passengers in storing carry on items. The aircraft interior could have used a thorough cleaning. Meal service was efficient although flight attendants disappeared once the bland food was served. The pilot and first officer spoke excellent English cabin attendants could have used some tutoring. We chose this carrier because it offered the only choice of non stop service between Macau and Chengdu.,,,,,
Flew Air Macau from Tapei to Macau and back during the Chinese New Year. A321 were deployed at the TPE-MFM sector. Economy class was full seats were cramped but bearable for the 1.5 hr flight. Food was poor. MFM-TPE sector had no boarding bridge so has to take the bus to the aircraft. Which I find it quite annoying given how small the Macau International Airport was and not much traffic go through Air Macau still can't find a boarding bridge. Again food was poor on the way back. Crew on both flight were efficient though but lack of smile and can clearly felt that they were treating Business Class passengers better when the curtain between the two classes is still open.,,,,,
Taipei to Shanghai via Macao in Economy. Check-in swift and all flights on time. I was allowed to go ahead of the mess of tour groups at the Shanghai counter in order to check in. Seats are cramped and food is fair (you might want to eat before you board). Planes were full on all sectors. Bring a good book for entertainment. Not exactly the world's jazziest airline but certainly not the worst.,,,,,
Taipei To Beijing which transfered in Macau. Economy class seat was incredibly small. The food was OK from Beijing to Macau but is a nightmare from Macau to Taipei. Services well done and crew are polite. Passengers should notice that the airline often delay or cancel their flights.,,,,,
Y class MFM-BKK. Check-in with few smiles actually but smooth not charged any excess baggage charge despite being slightly overweight departure on time. Onboard the staff were polite and cheerful helped lifting heavy hand baggage in overhead locker and present throughout the whole flight. Language skills good and attentive in all our needs. Offered music headset pillow and blanket and at time of meal served also main course choice: appreciated that. Good security instructions by video presentation and good IFE with an interesting travelog film. Wide duty free choice. Toilet conditions could have been much better! For all the rest Air Macau is a reliable airline as far as I experienced especially in terms of helpful and knowledgeable onboard staff. I would recommend it also for its good fares and I would definitely prefer to fly again with them instead of trying low-cost competitors on same route.,,,,,
Shanghai to Taipei The flight was delayed for more than 3 hours without explanation. Eventually we were informed to board an A300. It was an awful and old aircraft and full of terrible smell and the air conditioning was not functioning properly. This airline does not pay attention to flight safety - I consider Air Macau is the worst airline I have ever taken.,,,,,
Macau-Shanghai. Business Class. Full cabin. Drinks meal tea and coffee all served and cleared away 45 minutes after take-off. Why the rush? I filled in a Customer Comment card requesting a reply but never received it. I definitely recommend avoiding Air Macau - it is worth going to HKG just to use DragonAir - 1000 times better than Air Macau.,,,,,
"Macau-Bangkok - business class. The airline changed its departure time without notifying me from 6pm to 11:30pm! Fortunately I found out by accident. My experience with the ground crew and Macau airport personnel was similar - poor or no English. The Business Class Lounge lady told me ""no more food go downstairs"". When I went to the restaurant there was almost no food left. We finally departed at almost 12:00 midnight amidst great confusion. Onboard the service was very polite the food was ample but mediocre entertainment system was retro with service announcements that seemed to occur every 15 minutes. Air Macau is not cheap. The only advantage of Air Macau is that if you are going to Macau you avoid having to take the ferry from HK otherwise skip this one.",,,,,
I flew Air Macau SHA-MFM-TPE-MFM-SHA. The service was OK; the FA's spoke all English and were very polite. The food was good compared to other small Asian airlines. Only the ground staff was rude impatient and the English poor. On the flight from MFM to SHA the plane took of without one piece of luggage! We had to wait 2 hours for the luggage to arrive in SHA. Nobody of the ground staff spoke English; I had to ask a passenger to translate. As Air Macau's prices are not cheap at all it's a shame how they treat their passengers especially on the ground.,,,,,
I had a trip to Beijing with Air Macau. The first flight from Taipei to Macau. The cabin clean and new but the seat small. The service of cabin crews is bad. They never smile during the flight. When they took the meal to passengers they didn't say thanks or you are welcome. The breakfast was poor. Next flight was from Macau to Beijing. I changed aircraft and cabin crew on this flight. This aircraft is larger but the seat and service was still bad. A crew was really impatient when I wanted to buy some duty-free items. The entertainment was poor. They didn't have movies on a three hour flight. The program was almost the same as TPE/MFM flight. The third flight from Beijing to Maca - a very excellent flight. Cabin crew friendly and polite - food was delicious. My last flight from Macau to Taipei. Bad service bad food and bad entertainment. Air Macau earns a lot of money flying between Taiwan and China. I think they should improve most of their service (seat pitch entertainment meal etc.). They should educate cabin crews to be more courteous to passengers. Their service is worse than EVA Air and TransAsia Airways on TPE-MFM route.,,,,,
A very good airline! Flew Macau to Beijing and back. The plane was new and clean but the food was poor-noodles in a brown sauce and a vanilla cake. The cabin staff however were great! They all spoke English they were polite and well dressed and they found American magazines for us to read being the only Western pax on board.,,,,,
I just completed a round trip on SIN to MFM by Air Macau two days ago. The aircrafts (A319 and A321 ) are new and clean. The pilot gave comprehensive flying details in English and the cabin staff repeated the pilot comment in Chinese. This is good service as Air Macau is highly dependent on Taiwanese and China market exclusively where the passenger may not understand the pilot comments. The cabin staff are attentive and respond fast to the passenger demand. Food is good and the seat is comfortable. One setback is the flight entertainment. They have no movie shown onboard except for a short documentary show last for about one hour. I guess Air Macau majority Flight times are normally less than 2.5 hours and the time may not permit a movie program. Maybe they should consider to feature movie programs for flight to Beijing Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. Overall Air Macau a relative new airline with only 9 years of operation has done well and I will fly with them again.,,,,,
"  My wife and I booked round trip flights to Majahanga from Tana with Air Madagascar on January 21st. Last Saturday due to the continued stringent travel restrictions in place in South Africa and Madagascar and the uncertainty the idea of well any kind of travel really during a global pandemic we sadly were forced to cancel our honeymoon. We informed the airline of our decision in writing and four days later (i.e. yesterday) we received an email (from a Gmail account no less) offering a single penalty-free flight change valid 'til January 2021 despite our expressly requesting for a refund. Which airline in this day and age doesn't have their own email domain? Real professional outfit. We let it be known immediately in a subsequent email that we didn't appreciate not-so-subtly being coerced to accept a ""solution"" to a problem not of our making that benefits them at our expense. We are still awaiting a response. As others have pointed out flights with this airline are a lottery. I wish we'd known this beforehand so we could've saved ourselves the headache. We'd give them a zero rating if we could. They really are that bad.",,,,,
"  Antananarivo to Johannesburg. This is the worst airline I have used. The two flights I booked with them were both canceled on the day of the flight. One was canceled due to mechanical problems on the plane, only after everyone had boarded, and was replaced by another flight 12 hours later. The other an international flight to Johannesburg was canceled with no explanation. We were told that the next flight wasn’t for a full week thereafter, which would have caused us to miss our international flight back to the US. The customer service agent could only offer me a call center email address for requesting a refund. When I did so, they told me they could only process the refund through “my travel agent” — but I had booked the tickets myself, on the Internet! Canceling a flight and not refunding it is called stealing.",,,,,
"  Booked an Air Madagascar return ticket from Nairobi to Antananarivo, operated by Kenya Airways both ways (cheaper than booking directly via Kenya Airways). Onward flight date comes and there's no check in counter for Air Madagascar at Nairobi Airport so I go to the Kenya Airways counter and attempt to check in. They have a hard time locating my name in the system but I assume they override it manually and check me in regardless since my ticket clearly indicates that I should be on the flight. Fast forward 2 days and I'm at the airport in Antananarivo for my flight back to Nairobi. Same story, no check in counter for Air Madagascar (in Madagascar!) and I go over to the Kenya Airways counter again and they can't locate my name in the system again. I go to the Air Madagascar ticketing office and they confirm that I'm on the flight. I go back to the check in counter and this back and forth happens 2 more times (going through security over and over again, everyone looking at me crazier each time) and each time, the people at the check in counter can't locate my name. Finally, the fella at the Air Madagascar ticketing office issues me a new ticket for later in the day free of charge. Nice gesture and in order for this not to happen again, I try to check in myself online.. guess what? Air Madagascar doesn't have an online check in feature on their website! I'm writing this as I wait for my second flight, wondering whether I'll have to go through this ordeal again later. I recommend just booking with Kenya Airways directly.",,,,,
  Antananarivo to Majunga. Flight was operated by EWA; two hours late and information about the delay was bad; aircraft was a little bit old; friendly FA; some refreshments served. Fare a little bit high.,,,,,
"  Tuléar to Antananarivo. Quick Check-in; on time; plane a bit old; refreshments and a snack served; friendly flight attendants. The fare was somehow high, but this is Madagascar. You shouldn't come here if you are pampered by low-cost carriers;",,,,,
"  Antsiranana to Sambava. Flight was booked in Air Madagascar website; flight was operated by Air Tsaradia, the new domestic carrier. Check-in quite fast; not too serious about little overweight luggage and cabin luggage; due to the short flight-time, no refreshments, fare a little bit expensive compared to flight-time; alternative would have been to travel 12h on very bad road.",,,,,
" Flew Sainte Marie to Antananarivo with Air Madagascar. Online, this looks to be an airline of last resort, but I found myself requiring their services at the end of a holiday in Madagascar. I wasn't totally surprised when my flight was cancelled, and the replacement flight the next day ran 2 hours late. To their credit, they were very forthcoming with meals and accommodation while we were stranded.",,,,,
"  Antananarivo to Fort Dauphin. I have flown multiple times on domestic flights with Air Madagascar over the past few years. They are truly the worst airline I have ever had the misfortune of flying with. Delays, cancellations, bad customer service, dirty planes, no in-flight refreshments, hugely over-priced. In one instance I chose to travel for over 50 hours on a public bus to reach my destination, rather than give any more money to them and I would probably do that again after yet another delay on my most recent flight.",,,,,
"  Paris to Antananarivo return. Never use this airline if you plan on getting home on time. Our homeflight was cancelled without notice. It took a full extra day to get home - we have filed a complaint and sought compensation, and after 7 consecutive emails, we recieved only one short response from air Madagascar we got no compensation at all.",,,,,
"Antananarivo to Fort Dauphin via Morondava and no notable issues with Air Madagascar service. Easy website to navigate and book. All flights were on time with pleasant crew and ground service as well. Snacks on outward flights only, and return flight had a fruit danish and coffee only (100 minute flight). Nice, very nice and bright interior on the ATR 72 (first time I'd flown this aircraft). But - and this is a well known issue for Air Madagascar - they did move the departure time up for my return flight to Tana, From 940 am to 640am. Grrr. At least they emailed me and informed my hotel the afternoon before. Note though: domestic flying is cheaper if you fly into Madagascar with them. I didn't, given their spotty record and flying from Canada to Madagascar on a tight time line.",,,,,
"Antananarivo to Paris. It was my mistake, I had been warned about Air Madagascar. But my lovely agency in London felt that it would be fine. The flight out had no inflight entertainment (they never bothered with the headsets), the flight back was actually 3 cancelled flights -I had only been delayed 14 hours some had been waiting for 2 days. So nearly 12 hours, no inflight entertainment, no hot water, so no tea or coffee. We didn't see a soul for 8 hours. I have been working in Madagascar so have had a few flights. On this trip one flight was brought forward 5 hours and then took off 30 mins early. I feel sorry for the staff, they do their best, but the management of this airline reflects the government they just don't care about the people / customers.",,,,,
Mauritius to Antananarivo. We have booked five flights with Air Madagsacar. None of them took place or was in time. Flights have either been cancelled within 12 hrs of departure or after waiting at the airport for hours. Staff at the airport is either unwilling or stupid - or both. This airline is a disaster!,,,,,
"If you have the time and funds not to travel Air Madagascar then this will always be your best option. It is without doubt the most useless airline. Having lived in Madagascar for two years I would always take the option of hiring a car and going over land if financially feasible/the time is available. The few flights I have taken with the airline have always been delayed, even once as we were on the plane we then had to disembark and were told that the flight would go sometime the next day. It is very common for flights to be cancelled, I've even had friends whose flights have been turned out mid-flight and returned to their original destination.  Also expect your bags to be lost as well. Make sure that you check on your flight frequently days before your flight because it is no new phenomena for them to pull your flight forward and not notify you. This has happened to several friends. Cabin staff have typically always been very nice though. Ground staff are slow and vacant. Don't expect anything to be done on time or if it is expect to be treated as though you are seriously putting someone out.",,,,,
"We flew Air Madagascar from Paris to Antananarivo return in economy class in November 2015. Our initial flight from Paris was cancelled without any notification. After checking my booking online (it always worth checking if you fly with Air Madagascar) we realised that we were supposed to fly 3 days later, although Air Madagascar didn't ask if this would be suitable for us. We tried to contact them by email, phone and we even went to the customer service desk in Charles de Gaulle Airport - no one was there to help us. Their customer service doesn't exist. After few days of attempts our tour operator in Madagascar was lucky to get in touch with them locally. We asked at least to move our return flight so we can stay in Madagascar as many days as planned. We were not surprised when our return flight to Paris was moved to the following day. We contacted the airline on the day of the flight to check and they couldn't confirm the exact date and time of the departure. They didn't offer accommodation. So as a result, we had to completely reschedule our tour including all hotels etc.; we missed 2 connection flights from London to Paris return (we live in London). We also had one domestic flight with this airline to Morondava. This flight was also cancelled and then rescheduled the night before the flight. Local people in Madagascar called this airline Air Maybe. I wouldn't recommend anyone to fly with Air Madagascar. The tickets are cheaper than other with airlines, but as a result it will cost you much more than were planning to spend.",,,,,
"Air Madagascar cancelled the initial flight from Bangkok and moved it to the following day without warning or explanation. They did provide accommodation and the flight was ok. Our next flight with Air Madagascar was then a domestic one, a week later, Antananarivo to Sante Marie. This was overpriced at 500 euro pp for a one hour flight. Without any warning the flight was moved to 4 hours earlier. Air Madagascar acknowledged that we confirmed our flight 24 hours prior and that they provided no warning of the change and no replacement flight. Due to the cancellation of this flight our return flight booking to Bangkok was wiped from their system without warning. We had to frantically arrange a ticket with minutes to spare. 3 flights with Air Madagascar  and 3 stressful and very poor experiences",,,,,
I flew BKK-TNR-BKK in business class in May 2015. Overall the 8 hr flight is good and on-time (a bit earlier than scheduled). On TNR-BKK the flight stopped in Bangkok before going to Guangzhou. A340 was used on this route. Staff are very nice the facilities on board like toilet entertainment and food and beverages could be compared to business class on other airlines. Inflight entertainment - no flying map no music no movie.,,,,,
I flew Economy Paris-Tana Tana-Antsiranana Antsiranana-Tana Tana-Paris in Sept and Oct 2014. Local flights were on 737 nothing special (neither bad nor good) the intercontinental flight was on an old 340. The fittings were old but ok seating and food ok as well in-flight entertainment a little inferior to Air France (smaller screen not as many choices) but then again AF also does not use their newest equipment on this route so that the difference is not this big. Two of the four flights were delayed by several hours one of which was my return flight on Oct 6 to Paris which was delayed by 3.5 hours. This may become a real problem for anybody requiring a connecting flight as AirMad has no code-share partners in Europe with whom one could book a combined ticket. Hence it cost me about 350 Euro to change the reservation for my AF connecting flight (fortunately it could be changed) and Air Madagascar is not willing to reimburse me referring to the conditions of sale (even though AirMad told me differently in Tana when it became clear that the delay would cause me to miss my connecting flight in Paris). Hence people not living near Paris or Marseille should take this risk into account (after all my so far longest delay on an AirMad flight was 13 hours in 2010 hence one should plan on long transfer times to be on the sure side). I would not recommend it.,,,,,
Flew from Toliara to Tana. What to say about Air Madagascar - the airline usually runs on Malagasy time and this was no exception. Flight was due to leave at 18.25. By 19.00 no plane had turned up and there was absolutely nobody in the terminal with any kind of information. There are screens in the terminal but as there is only 1 flight per day they are of little use. Fortunately TLE has a fairly modern terminal (for Madagascar) and a number of places to buy drinks. 8pm came and went then 9pm still no plane and it's getting dark. Eventually at about half past 9 three guys arrived in a jeep proceeded to drive down the runway setting up a series of cones with lights on top. The first we knew anything was happening was when a plane appeared on the runway taxied up to the terminal and unloaded some passengers. We were then allowed out onto the tarmac and up the steps to the plane. Plane was a fairly modern 737 seats were reasonably comfortable staff were very friendly and as the plane was only half full the flight was one of the most pleasant I have had on AirMad. Flying with AirMad is always an experience.,,,,,
We have just returned from Johannesburg via Antananarivo to Nosy Be on air Madagascar. All of our flights were on time. We found the airline to be extremely reliable the planes in good condition the staff extremely efficient and friendly. We shall certainly recommend Air Madagascar to all of our friends travelling to Madagascar.,,,,,
CDG-TNR-CDG B767 TNR-NOS B737 NOS-TNR-TMM ATR 72 TMM-TNR Twin Otter. The seating on the B767 is uncomfortable. Entertainment poor and toilets not very clean. Positive points the FAs and food. A big positive point to the schedule - by leaving CDG at the end of the day you don't waste the next one not withstanding the 10hours flight. Domestic flights were nice and acceptable. However on the leg NOS-TNR I experienced a 5 hours delay (quite usual).,,,,,
We used Air Madagascar for four internal flights. All four were reasonably on time (max delay about 45 mins). Cabin staff friendly and good complimentary snack and newspaper on each flight. Be prepared for very rapid braking at fort Dauphin (short runway),,,,,
Flew Air Madagascar frequently on a month-long trip from Canada over Christmas. International routing CDG-TNR-CDG. Also flew TNR-Morondava and back TNR-Diego Diego-NosyBe NosyBe-TNR TNR-SainteMarie and back. Across these flights I experienced their B767 on the international route the B737 on the flight to Diego and ATR72s on the other domestic routes. Overall I enjoyed the airline. The 767 does have a tired interior and I would certainly prefer to have preassigned seating. Flight attendants were friendly on all flights but English was not good so I'm not sure how I would have managed if my wife wasn't with me to translate from French and Malagasy into English. All of our flights left on time but I couldn't understand why we were asked to arrive so early for these small flights. My biggest complaint is with the airports in Madagascar not the airline. Seating is very limited and if you can find it it is most uncomfortable. Found the airport in Morondava to be surprisingly the best of the above locations and the airport in Diego is just plain awful. I did find it difficult to deal with Air Madagascar when booking my tickets from Canada. You can't deal directly with the airline but rather their North American agent Sita World Travel and I found they're agents friendly but not all that smart and very slow to answer e-mails. Simple questions like finding out flight availability and pricing seemed to be a big task. I would prefer an online reservation similar to that offered by other major airlines.,,,,,
CDG-TNR-FDP-TNR-CDG The outbound flight was fine but CDG was awful. The queues at check in were a bit long but after an hour we were checked in. The food was nice tea and coffee were served often along with a choice of soft drinks. The seats were quite cramped but there was just enough legroom. The choice of films were not up to much but the music channels were fine with some good Malagasy music in there as well. The aircraft was a 767-300. Flying from Tana (Antananarivo) to Fort Dauphin was an experience. We had to wait for 3 hours at the airport being served coffee with horrible sweetened condensed milk and being handed week old newspapers with payment demanded. We checked in all right though. The plane was an old second generation 737 with no allocated seating. The announcements were in Malagasy and French and some sort of inconprehensible English which just sounded like the air hostess reading some English off a card. Almost no inflight service just a drink of orange juice. Fort Dauphin Airport is interesting no luggage belts so your bag number is shouted out and you have to hand them your ticket to reclaim. The return trip was much the same as the first. At TNR we were delayed for 2 hours for some technical fault which seemed to make no sense whatsoever. It was claimed that Engine number 3 had some sort of problem but there are 2 engines on a 767. As neither of the engines were started when we got on the plane the airconditioners weren't working. There are no vents above your head on this 767 either. Some people fainted as we waited for 2 hours on this sweltering plane before we departed. We missed our connection at CDG too. In the end the flight was ok good for third world but bad for everything else.,,,,,
MXP-NOS (Malpensa-Nosi Be) return in Economy. The Y fare is good Business is expensive with no airmiles in any alliance so opted for Y class. Outbound leg on time (767) flight completely full seat backs a little thin but reasonably comfortable (exit or bulkhead rows 11 18 19 and 20 are best for legroom). FA's smiling speak good French. Food and wine OK soft drink selection limited and they ran out of beer quickly. Movies surprisingly up to date (In Her Shoes etc) but dubbed in French or Italian both of which I speak but would have still preferred the original version. No PTV but ceiling screens every 8-10 rows. Landed in NOS on time huge queues for visa-on-arrival in a tiny stifling airport. Take my advice and obtain a visa beforehand you will breeze through immigration. Return leg delayed by 5 hours although I had confirmed the day before and had supplied a contact phone No I arrived at an empty NOS airport at 7am for a 9am flight to be greeted by a cleaning lady and told that the flight would leave after 12 noon. My friend and I spent 3 hours in a small quaint cafe across the street from the terminal eating spaghetti and drinking Malagasy beer overall an interesting way to spend time! At 10am some airport personnel started to arrive apparently the plane had had engine trouble in Antananarivo hence the delay. Check-in began at 11.00 we managed to check-in among the first but long Italian queue in a tiny airport which cannot really handle such passenger numbers. The 767 left at 2pm many empty seats on this leg so we could spread out a bit OK inflight catering 2 full meals better drinks selection. Memorable daytime flight over Africa with fantastic views of Kilimanjaro and the Rift Valley.,,,,,
BKK-TNR. This relatively new service is performed by leased B767. The layout is overwhelmingly economy (in a 2-3-2 configuration) with very modest seat pitch but the flight we got was only about 60% full. Exit row seats 18ABFG and 19 ABFG give a good deal of extra legroom with row 18 preferred due to row 19’s proximity to the lavatories (which seemed to get a lot of use in our flight!). However none of these exit row seats recline. 20 C and E may have a bit more stretch room also. Service is good but meals and entertainment are somewhat from a previous era with one meal of a sandwich and some strange tasting orange juice and with one screen for every 8 rows or so. On approach to landing an interesting looking video of Madagascar was shown but unfortunately only with a French soundtrack and quite poor audio at that.,,,,,
MXP-NOS-MXP Y-Class. Air Madagascar features quite old aircraft (B767) but clean. FA's attentive to passengers' needs polite and ready to offer you a smile. Tasty food but poor entertainment program (no PTVs). Very punctual flights on both legs. Nice amenities were given on board.,,,,,
My recent experience shows Air Madagascar to have very poor customer service. I was downgraded from business to economy 2 minutes before boarding they said because business was full. However when we boarded business was less than half full. I asked to be moved to business since I had already paid for it. However they told me it was to late and against the procedures. Why have stewards on the flight if they can't make simple decisions especially if the airline has clearly made a mistake. I feel cheated by the airline.,,,,,
"Air Madagascar which has a dense domestic network and reasonable regional links has at this time only one intercontinental route Paris - Antananarivo and one aircraft to fly the route a Boeing 767-300 Extended Range which comes from Air Canada and is fitted with the current AC Business Class long range seat a six abreast 66 inch pitch recliner with extendable foot rest. Not quite a bed but an extremely comfortable arrangement with at least 160 degrees recline and almost horizontal leg support. This is superior to any competing business class seat in the region. The lumbar support is deactivated and mostly stuck in the ""hard"" position a minor inconvenience as is the availability of only 1 toilet in business class sometimes insufficient for a 24 seat cabin plus use by the crew. On the other hand when was the last time you found real cloth lemon grass scented napkins in the lavatory reminiscent of another age? Food and beverage service are of a high standard not quite the F/C service of top long range airlines but well above normal intercontinental business class. DVDs are provided with a limited choice of films. Service by the crew was always attentive polite and going the extra mile. Punctuality was perfect to the minute on both legs of the round trip. Although there is only one aircraft serving the route scheduling provides for extended periods to catch up with delays before the next flight. Altogether a very enjoyable experience definitely superior to the competition's product.",,,,,
"Air Malawi brands its self as ""Africa's friendly airline""!? I live in Kenya and my mother was coming from the UK to Blantyre via Nairobi. She was booked on a Saturday flight to Blantyre via Lilongwe from Nairobi. On the Friday we found that Air Malawi had cancelled the flight (without thinking to tell us). When I contacted them they said there was a flight on the Monday but it was full so they rebooked her for the Wednesday flight. As she was going to Malawi for 2 weeks this would have made her trip very short. Finally I managed to get her on the monday flight. Air Malawi have two scheduled flights a week from Nairobi to Lilongwe. Monday and Friday. But they book people for all seven days of the week. If enough people book they fly if they don't they cancel the flight. The thing that really annoyed me was that I chose to use Air Malawi because they told me they fly every day. If I had known the truth I would have used Kenya Airways who admit they have only two flights a week. The second thing that annoyed me was that there was not even a hint of an apology from them for cancelling the flight. If you are trying to go to Malawi my advice is to use Kenya Airways. They are more expensive - but they will get you there when they say you will and if they can't at least they will say sorry!",,,,,
"A very pleasant airline that tries hard despite being the national carrier of a very poor country with only 3 planes. The service on the 737 is equal to SAA. The domestic flight on a Cessna Caravan between Blantyre and Club Mak was perhaps the most fun flight I have ever undertaken. The pilot flew low so we could look at the scenery and even made several detours to look at herds of elephants and hippos. Service on this flight was understandably limited to a ""help yourself"" cooler filled with soft drinks but too busy looking out the windows anyway.",,,,,
"  At the check-in in Vienna the clerk called Air Malta to check if I could travel with my sailing life jacket which contains a 22g CO2 cartridge. He confirmed that Air Malta granted permission for this. I then asked the check-in clerk to confirm with the captain that this was ok. He came back to me say that the captain had given his permission. I flew to Malta and my bag was not on the conveyor on arrival. I found out two days later by sending my wife to Vienna Airport that security in Vienna found the CO2 cartridge and asked Air Malta if they can release it. Air Malta declined and my bag was confiscated. My wife managed to access the bag, and after removing my life jacket the bag was flown to Malta. Not only did Air Malta not honour their agreement to carry my bag, but they did not inform me of what had happened. To make things worse, after trying more than 30 times - all day in fact - to call Air Malta I did not succeed in getting any information. I was never informed as to what had happened. Without sending someone to Vienna airport at great inconvenience I would never have known what happened to my Bag.",,,,,
"  The flight we took was initially delayed twice, and then cancelled afterwards, making us lose the second flight from Amsterdam to New York. Therefore, as per EU regulation, we are entitled to compensation (600 euros each for two people), which they acknowledge. After having sent the bank wire details on the 17th of April, regardless the several call occurred, they still did not complete the payment without providing any kind of reason for the delay. At this point, after all this time, seems clear that their decision is not to pay at all and to wait until they will become a new entity (as has been announced over the media).",,,,,
"  Aircraft changes are normal these days. Flight experience ok, nothing to say against it. Industry standard seat pitch, inflight food and drinks. Very good fare.  But my emergency extra legroom reservation was not respected, only the seat number. I was asked if I have reserved 13D, but they did not mention that this is no emergency row anymore. So losing three of my points. Beside the badly trained check-in staff, I do not understand why an airline with one airplane type is giving to some few planes other row numbers for emergency rows, when selling them for higher fees.",,,,,
" Worst flying experience ever. We have to wait 17 hours to get back home. We sleep on floors but then security comes and tells us we’re not even allowed to sit on the floor. They want us to stand for 17 hours? On the flight from Vienna to Malta we weren’t even offered drinks and I don’t mean free drinks but not even an option that we could buy them. If you want to travel with Air Malta don’t do it. Save your time, money and everything. If you still want to go beware that you going to end up in trouble.",,,,,
"  Chaotic boarding because of all hand luggage that clearly exceeded allowances. Overpriced, poor quality onboard food and drink (€3.50 for cheap instant coffee). Nearly an hour before they deplaned and another hour for baggage. No real baggage drop, inadequate check-in desks at MLA and very slow. Seat change just to satisfy late check in's and put me in an exit row despite telling them I had medical conditions that should exclude me. They used the old 'late aircraft change ' excuse. Air Malta have a common seating plan throughout the fleet, making seat changes unnecessary in the event of an aircraft change. Same baggage chaos coming back. All that lost revenue from hold baggage charges that could be levied! Ground staff and cabin crew need customer service training.",,,,,
"  It is an absolute joke that Air Malta does not have an app in 2023. Plus the prices are absolutely ridiculous. I don't know what revenue strategy they try but should definitely reconsider it. It make zero sense. A ticket in economy costs 430 euros and a ticket in business class 290 euros on their website, at the same time, and for the same destination. I understand this is not a low cost carrier however it really acts like one. Too bad you don't have other options if you want to reach the destination.",,,,,
"  The customer service was non-existent and shambolic. On the return flight KM102 from Malta to London Heathrow (3rd January), there was over a 3 hour delay for the passengers in obtaining luggage, this is longer than the actual flight. There was no onsite Air Malta customer service to assist and advise what was going on or when to expect our luggage. Due to the evening flight and long ongoing drive home my family had to leave without our luggage. This meant I had the unfortunate situation of dealing with the central customer services based in Malta to try and recover my luggage. To date Air Malta’s central customer services have still not responded to my emails. Their advice provided by phone was nonsensical. Due to no local phone number, I had to pay international rates to contact them for their absolutely useless support. Subsequently, I drove 3.5 hours back to Heathrow at a later date in my own time and at my own expense to see if I could obtain my luggage. Fortunately this was successful, however I found that my luggage had been sitting unsecured in terminal 4’s luggage reclaim for 4 days. There was nothing to stop people taking the whole suitcase or personal possessions. To sum up I will never use this airline again, this airline is an insult to the nation of Malta. Air Malta are acting like the worst low cost carrier, whilst charging their tickets at a premium.",,,,,
" On our flight from Paris, they successfully lost our main suitcase. When we tried to talk to their office beside check-in desk 1a, their representative was incredibly rude and abusive, including turning her back and walking away. Not what we were expecting. On the last day of our stay in Malta, they told us that they had located and received our luggage and would send it on to us. Five hours later, however, they admitted that they had lost it again. When they rediscovered it, we instructed them to keep it within sight whilst we travelled to the airport to collect it (an hour each way) as they were unconvincing about whether they would deliver it to the right hotel and were even uncertain about whether it would be before or after we left. In the end, we had the use of said suitcase for four hours either side of midnight, out of a four day stay. The airline also successfully destroyed our other suitcase by virtually breaking off one of the wheels. We received no apologies, no sympathy and not even regret from their people. Obviously, Malta itself is an attractive destination. But if you want to enjoy it, I strongly recommend that you fly via another airline, and watch out for any codeshares; using Air Malta is asking for trouble.",,,,,
  My flight was deliberately overbooked and despite having booked my tickets 10 months prior and arriving at the airport 4 hours early I was turned away despite having a ticket. We were persistently told different things by different members of staff. I rang Air Malta customer service who said they would call me back and then literally hung up on me. The Air Malta representative at the airport then refused to speak to us. When I rang the day before I was guaranteed the flight was not overbooked and there was no problem. I have never been subjected to such dreadfully poor customer service. Offers of remedial compensation will not make up for the inconvenience and distress caused by your airline’s shameless overbooking.,,,,,
"  Shameful airline, avoiding my refund now for over a year. Emailed over 20 times, called over 10 times. Somehow could pay back the cheaper ticket but lost the same bank details for the more expensive ticket. Fly with anyone else.",,,,,
"  Booked our ticket in September 2021. Unfortunately, another leg of the trip was cancelled by Lufthansa (who refunded us in less than 24 hours), which means that I had to cancel my AM flight. No worries though, I made sure that the booking was 'fully refundable' before committing. Applied for a refund on the 3rd of November, 2021 and was told that I should have my money back within 60 working days. Fast forward to the 18th of June, 2022 - I have been refunded half of the original amount paid, with AM quipping that taxes are not refundable, none of this was mentioned when booking and cancelling the flight.",,,,,
"  After our flight on the 7th of June 2020 was cancelled due to covid restrictions we had to reschedule our flight to the 8th of August 2021. Unfortunately, at the last minute, Malta changed its Covid regulations, not recognising a covid recovery certificate as viable. Due to this, we had to request a refund, which I completed at the start of August 2020. On the 31st of January 2022 my refund was processed. The company requested I provide them with my banking information so that they could transfer the funds. I already provided them with my banking information the moment I bought a ticket through the airline. Since the 31 st of January I have contacted air Malta call centre more than 15 times. Every employee I have on the telephone seems to have a different excuse for why it had not been transferred to my account yet. In addition, the employees always promise me they will call me back or send me an email. However, they never do. They also claim that they cannot contact any other department within their company via telephone ""due to company policy"", which makes its easy for them to delay the truth of my refund status every time I call them. I am getting sick and tired of the constant lies and demand one straight answer.",,,,,
"  In December 2019 we booked our trip to Malta with Air Malta for our family of 6 persons. Without covid-19, we would travel to Malta in May 2020. Unfortunately, Air Malta cancelled our trip, because of the covid-restrictions. They gave us three options. We chose for the option to wait one year and ask for a refund. We did ask for the refund after one year. After several calls and e-mails to Air Malta we still haven't got our money back. I see that more people have this problem with Air Malta.  We have the right to get our money back.",,,,,
"  In December 2019/January 2020 we booked our trip to Malta with Air Malta. Without covid-19, we would travel to Malta in June 2020. Unfortunately, Air Malta cancelled our trip, because of the covid-restrictions, which I fully understand. They gave us three options. We chose for the option, to wait one year and ask for a refund. I also understood that they could not immediately pay everyone back, but wanted to spread things, and that we needed to wait one year. But now, we are almost two years further and we did not receive our money back yet. And I think this will never happen anymore because now, they even don’t answer my e-mails anymore. So thank you, for stealing money from a young couple, building on their future. Therefore, I would not recommend Air Malta to my family and friends.

" Let me first get over my never-ending grumble about how awful European Airlines' Business Class seating is - an economy seat with the middle seat blocked, and no extra legroom. However, my frustration was eased considerably on my flights with Air Malta. Yes, it was the same layout - 3x3 with the middle seat empty, but with about 2 inches more legroom, and slight recline, which actually did make a difference. And the seating was surprisingly comfortable. The flights both outbound and return were on time, and the cabin crew though disengaging (understandably due to covid) were however polite and professional on the service front. On both flights, a pre-meal drink of fruit juice and prosecco (no champagne) was offered. On the outbound flight a delicious lunch was served, all on one tray, consisting of several small items and a hot main course of Maltese Beef Bragioli (stuffed meat bundles). The presentation was excellent in traditional Maltese ceramicware, known as 'Zingla' bowls. Lunch followed by coffee and drinks from the bar. On the return flight, the typical breakfast of egg, bacon, mushroom, and tomato (a bit boring) was served. Both the mini bread rolls and croissants were warm. Overall, I did enjoy both flights, and was better than many other European airline flights I have been on.",,,,,
"  Overall this was a good experience and all was on time. There was an issue around online check-in as it seems you still need to visit the desk. We did online check-in and were issued with boarding passes and seat allocations. This worked through airport security but was an issue when we tried boarding at the gate and they had to re-check us in. Service from there was good. Maybe not as personable as some airlines but crew often checked we were doing OK and offered top ups. D.O.C prosecco was on offer rather than champagne but there was a fair selection of drinks. The meal was quite impressive with the Maltese tile below the plate. Food was of good quality, the pate was amazing and the bread warm and fluffy. All else was well cooked and impressive for a short haul flight. This was my first time flying with Air Malta, the experience was good.",,,,,
"  Worst experience in my life.  At the airport I asked what the status was for using my ‘COVID-voucher’. The ticketing desk is unwilling to help, refers to me to yet another e-mail address of the refunds department, who apparently, have no phone and cannot be reached by anybody from the Air Malta ticketing desk.  I’ve been calling and mailing for weeks now to use that voucher and nobody seems to be able or willing to help. That combined with the answer: sir, if you do not leave this desk I will call airport security. I will not rest until I get what I’m entitled to.",,,,,
"  Changed my return flight with Air Malta. This can only be done by phone. But the guy on the phone must have made a mistake, because my booking code was faulty. I could not log in and I was not on the passenger list. Also, my priority boarding and seat were lost. This could not be corrected by phone. Had to be done on the airport. So both on going out and the return flight I had a problem. Air Malta's check in desks and supervisor treated me like it was somehow my fault! No apologies or anything, just 45 minutes of hassle upon check in and no priority available even though I could prove I paid for it. They did put me in the passenger list again, reluctantly. So finally I did go to Malta and back again.",,,,,
  If I could give them minus 5 stars I would. This is the worst and most dishonest airline I have ever dealt with. Don't expect them to ever return your phone call or email because it won't happen.  I paid for extra luggage but was not allowed to use it because they didn't update the ticket. Then they admitted the mistake but won't refund the cost because extra luggage is non-refundable. This makes no sense. ,,,,,
"  Was promised a refund for my cancelled flight over 5 months ago. It still hasn't been processed. Air Malta are ignoring all attempts to contact them to chase up on this, and have not issued a single update on when refunds will actually be processed. Avoid at all costs.",,,,,
"  The interior is old but confortable. It wasn't clean in Lisbon. Very tiring flight. No free service onboard. Bought a vegetarian lasagne, it was a regretful idea.",,,,,
  Worst airline and worst customer support. The customer service is rude and they never work towards a solution. They always find excuses for the airline and imply that the airline is never responsible for anything.,,,,,
"  I was slightly disappointed with my Air Malta experience. Wwe flew from Palermo to Malta, then to Rome after our holiday. In Palermo, there was only one check in counter open, which was necessary for us since we had to check our luggage. Thankfully we arrived early and there was only a very small queue. Palermo airport has terrible signage, we didn’t know where the check in counter was until we walked to the wrong zone. Boarding was done by bus at Palermo, all flights had bus gates. In Malta this is fine since there is literally no physical gates. Boarding was rather fast, and there were no zones, everybody can board at the same time. Both A320s we flew were older. The first flight was an all economy configuration, so the system gave us row 2, and row 3 was empty so I moved back to get a view of the landing. On the flight to Rome it was a bit weird, i was sent multiple emails asking if I would like to get upgraded, for what actually would’ve cost me double my ticket cost. Nobody was actually sitting in the first three rows, we had row 4 so I wanted to move to row 3 but the crew didn’t let me or anybody else. Service on both flights seemed nonexistent. I expected a drinks service on the Rome flight. The crew were friendly, seemed professional and helpful to those who needed help.  Overall, a below average experience, if flying from Italy, I would recommend them. If flying from the UK or other parts of Europe, try to consider another carrier as well.",,,,,
"  Heathrow to Malta. We were a party of 4 adults and one child. Staff were miserable. Hot food had to be ordered, but no one asked if we wanted anything. When we asked for a toastie it was like being told off for not ordering it. Drinks and food were served with a pay machine shoved in your face. The staff didnt even stop their conversation whilst serving us. When leaving the aeroplane, as always we said thankyou and again they couldnt acknowledge us or stop their conversation. One of our suitcases was ripped, got in a queue behind 5 others who had damaged cases. Our case was beyond repair and needed a new one to fly home with. 1 day of our 10 day holiday was spent getting a taxi to the nearest town, finding a shop that sold cases then taxi back to the hotel.",,,,,
  Air Malta cancelled the second leg of my ticket. They did not inform me nor the travel agent in time. I was finally re-routed with a 4 hour delay and no compensation whatsoever. It was a horrible flight! This is not the first time Air Malta has ruined my holiday. Last year my luggage arrived 6 days late for a cruise and Air Malta refused to pay any compensation whatsoever. I can only warn anybody not to book this airline!,,,,,
 Air Malta offers cheap tickets between VIE and Luqa. Both flights were on time. Although the seat configuration of the A320 is similar to their competitors they are still using very old seats that cause the feeling of having absolutely no room at all. I think that is the main problem with Air Malta - not sure if they are about to change that or invest into new planes but I would say a 2 hours flight is the maximum one would want to experience. There is no real service except the sales-trolleys so I was extremly surprised to see 5 cabin crew members on both flights instead of the regular minimum of 4 (certainly not because of the work load). Their business class is a little joke - there's not even a cabin divider so I was happy that I did not pay for a last-minute upgrade. When available in the cabin the crew was friendly but most of the time all five of them were not visible on both sectors. Since their competitors on this route are even worse I would say that KM is the best option our of VIE for flights to Luqa.,,,,,
"  Amsterdam to Malta. I was forced to check in my hand luggage. They said there was no room in the plane, so it had to go in the hold. It was opened and things stolen. The whole reason I only took hand luggage. No compensation, it wasn't their responsibility they said. ",,,,,
"  Amsterdam to Valletta. At check in we were told that the aircraft would be small and different to usual Air Malta airbus, and had to give in our hand luggage in which we had breakables and no locks. There was also no food or beverages you can buy on the plane and as 'compensation' they gave us a 4.95 euro voucher to buy something quickly before. The plane was not Air Malta but GetJet - a Lithuanian airline which operates very old aircraft. None of the crew or the captain were Maltese. I am a nervous flyer- we paid extra money to use Air Malta because we trust Air Malta. Had we gone for a cheaper budget airline we would have saved a lot of money and we still would have had a better experience as at least they offer refreshments on the plane. We also had an hour delay before take-off and when we asked the crew what the problem was they replied that they did not know. Two of our luggages were badly damaged and a rain jacket was missing from a side pocket of my luggage which was found opened. What's even worse than this experience is their customer service - a whole month of sending emails and reminders and calling, only to get nowhere except excuses and no compensation at all.",,,,,
" Malta to Lyon. First time ever flying Air Malta, visiting the beautiful island of Malta for the first time with my wife on our honeymoon. Arrived on easyJet and Purchased one-way tickets to leave thru Air Malta. Paid 2 x 90€ for the flights. Paid 2 x 80€ for 2 pieces of 20kg luggage. 180€ in air fare. 160€ in luggage. Complete rip-off.",,,,,
"  Kiev to Malta. I bought my flight through an aggregator site, so I wasn't able to pay for bags, so I tried to go on Air Maltas site to pay for bags. When I put in my confirmation code, the system wasn't able to find my info. When I tried to call customer service I wasn't able to speak to anyone and it went to voicemail. I left a Voicemail and never got a call back, so I went on their site and bought a voucher for my flight for €50 each way. When I got to the airport they told me there was no record of me paying for my bag, and even when I showed my voucher they said since it's not in the system they can't honor it. They called Air Malta and Air Malta said the same thing, so I had to pay another €80 for my bag or I wasn't getting on the flight. When I emailed Air Malta they told me I bought the wrong voucher and wouldn't issue a refund. I have no problem paying for bags but at least make it easier to do so and the customer service should work with customers to make sure they have a good experience. I had an awful one this time and won't fly Air Malta again!",,,,,
"  Malta to Paris CDG. The check-in staff was not welcoming or kind, but did their job. Security screening and boarding process expedite and simple. The airplane was in acceptable condition, short leg room but comfortable seats. The cabin crew, like the check in staff, was professional, but not specially kind. Flight departed exactly on time, and arrived 20 min before schedule. Comfortably managed by flight deck.",,,,,
"  Malta to Palermo. Our flight was suppose to leave at 5am on 9th September. We were a whole family, with 3 kids aged between 2-9 years old. At 3:30am we were at the airport, everything looked fine, the gate opened as well. At 4:30am, the flight was delayed to 6:10am. A few minutes after our flight was marked as “More info at 8” at 8 it got marked “more info at 9”, and so on until it stopped “More info at 11”. In the meantime nobody explained what’s happening. Excuses ranged from no staff available, to no plane available, to no coach to take us to the plane. After hours fighting and arguing, the flight got delayed to 10PM. They offered accomodation for all of us, only to spend 2 more hours just to take us there. The issues escalated as we ended up with police and RIU officers around us. Finally at 2pm we arrived at our hotel, slept and showered and at 7pm were picked up again. While waiting in our gate for our flight at 10PM, it was once more delayed to 10:40pm.",,,,,
"  The inbound flight arrived with roughly an hour delay and boarding was quite awful as we were told to wait in the jetbridge for around 5-10 minutes, then we left with an hour and a half of delay, and the crew wasn't very smiling and welcoming - but you get used to it with Air Malta.I ordered a warm sandwich and it was delicious, they have some movies in the overhead screens, but that's it, and the legroom is above average. Overall a great flight. However, after arrival in Malta airport, our luggage was extremely damaged,  and the ticket prices are quite high compared to what you get.",,,,,
"  We were supposed to be returning back from Malta to Southend, where we took off few days previously. Unfortunately, few weeks before our trip our flight back was cancelled and we had no other alternative but to accept a flight back from Malta to Gatwick. Before we left the UK I wrote an email to customer service and they assured me I could get a cab back reimbursed between Gatwick airport and Southend airport by producing a receipt. Which I did. But unfortunately I had further forms to fill and all my firends had to give permission and sign for me to send their passport details to Air Malta and another too. Why are they making things so complicated ! I am the one who paid for the cab why should my friends have to fill those forms and send them back to Air Malta, is beyond me. I don't think I will ever get reimbursed for that cab back, on top of the inconvenience it has caused me and the time I have sent trying to sort it out! Other small details, the checking online kept crashing : it took me 50 minutes to manage it for myself and my friends. Also onboard we had a mid morning flight arriving after 2pm : we were sitting in the middle of the plane - they ran out of sandwiches. Had to make do with some crisps.  On the way out, I wasn't very impressed with the cabin crew, very cold, no smile. Never using that airline again.",,,,,
"  I was routed onto the Air Malta website by Skyscanner to book simple 40 minute puddle jump from Catania to Malta, and tried booking my flight through there. Never got a confirmation e-mail or anything, which would be strange for most airlines but, as I'm reading the reviews here, is typical for Air Malta. So I called up ""Customer Services"" long distance and after 40 minutes got a hold of a pretty friendly fellow who looked up my reservation promptly rebooked my flight onto the wrong day. Finally got a confirmation of my flight on e-mail, spotted the mistake, called them back. Got a new guy who went through the whole procedure all over again. Got confirmation e-mail. Wrong flight. Then called again and got some crazy fellow who started screaming at me on the phone and put me on hold for half an hour, and wanted to charge me twice the amount for the flight I had already booked. I demonstrated to this out of control hothead how easy it was to book on another website by actually booking and canceling my flight on Expedia while he waited - that's how desperate he was to prove the point that their website worked fine which he lost. Too complicated. Just took the hydrofoil over as I'd lost faith in this small and incompetent crew. Too bad as the hydrofoil proved to be much more interesting and faster than the entire time I spent on the phone with these guys. I understand from captive clients in Malta that no-one books on their website but goes through third parties or even travel agents to avoid.",,,,,
  Rome to Malta. They have a dysfunctional technical system and website that might do booking errors and even send you confirmation emails with wrong data. The better part comes when you try to deal with their customer service for emergencies; this is when you realize that their call center is only person and that they are not “customer service” but rather “Customer Support” for ticketing as they mentioned. Finally for the cherry on top; even if they do realize they made a mistake they never own up to it but rather tell the customer that it is their fault for trusting the confirmation email they received. So they ask the customer to solve his issues and try to fly somehow either on other airlines or by paying for new tickets with new prices till they asses the case and decide whether a refund for the old booking is required. That is all besides the fact that their airport staff are of course hugely incompetent. I have travelled with more than 23 different airlines but this was by far the worst experience i had with an airline that supposedly charges you regular prices but operates as a low-fare or worse. Try to avoid them as much as you can!,,,,,
"  Malta to Heathrow. I used to go business class but unless you have the front row the leg room isn't very good. It is also quite antiquated compared to say Cathy Pacific where for the same flight-time of around three hours you get your own cubicle, a menu and top-class service. I now fly economy and every time there is a problem with check-in. Instead of having designated check-in desks for each destination they have about five for all destinations. This causes all sorts of problems as each flight destination has differing takeoff times. It's not rocket science to figure out if there's a huge holdup in your queue with everyone going to different places that the earlier flights have the danger of either missing their flight or spending so much time queuing you get no time to relax or have breakfast before boarding. When I travelled to Heathrow from Malta in April this year the computer in our queue packed up. Instead of using some sort of intelligence and splitting our queue into other ones which were working we were simply standing waiting. I had got to the airport early and spent almost an hour in the queue just standing. In the end I jumped queues as I was worried I might miss my flight. The check-in staff are very slow, the slowest out of all the many airlines I've travelled with. The only trouble is I have to use them as there is no alternative.",,,,,
" 
London Gatwick to Malta with Air Malta. The first face of the airline is the check-in counter. My experience was very bitter. Not friendly and acted as if you were not welcome at all. Also the lounge is a joke. They use the No. 1 lounge, which is packed with priority pass members - so packed that there are no places to sit and the food selection in the morning was bad.",,,,,
  Flew LGW to Malta and return in April with Air Malta. Flights both ways were on time and comfortable. Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming. On board snacks to buy were good value. Seat pitch average but not cramped.,,,,,
"  Our terrible time with Air Malta started with baggage check-in. We bought our tickets through Expedia and they just said ""Economy"". Turns out Air Malta has like 5 different ticket types and the one we had didn't have checked baggage. We didn't know this in advance, but whatever, we payed to check-in our luggage. We were traveling as a group of 3 and my friend was in a wheelchair because her leg was broken. She has been in a full cast up to her knee for over a month. On our way to Malta from Israel on flight Air Malta 829 that departed Sunday morning Apr. 14, 2019 at 7 AM, my friend was questioned about her cast, how long she's had it and if she's cleared to fly. We answered all of their questions, told them the cast was a month old and that the doctors cleared her to fly. In the end of this questioning we were all allowed to board and the Israeli ground stewardess even found my friend a row of seats so that she could elevate her leg comfortably. On our way BACK from Malta to Israel on flight Air Malta 828 that departed Friday morning Apr. 18, 2019 at 1 AM, my friend was giving the same round of questions, except that this time they declared she was unfit to fly and that their doctor said it would be very dangerous for my friend to fly with a full cast. It did not help that we told them we flew with there airline 5 days ago and that she was fine (they said that this was a mistake and she should never have been let on the first flight to begin with) or that we had papers (in Hebrew) proving my friend's cast was at least several weeks old - nothing helped. They told us she had to go to a clinic in Malta to get her cast cut so that it was a half (and not full cast) and that we were wasting our time. My 2 traveling companions got in a cab and went to go get the cast cut, in a foreign country where we knew nothing of the healthcare system. This would have been fine, but the clinic they sent us do didn't have the equipment to cut the cast! So that trip was a waste. When we asked what we could do if their own recommendation didn't pan out and they said that my friend would have to stay to get her cast cut at the hospital. We tried to find out from the Maltese Air Malta manager if there would be any kind of compensation since they would not let my fried on the plane - could they transfer her ticket? Book her a hotel for her extra overnight stay? We were given a negative response on both counts and she told us that it was stated clearly in the Air Malta rules that you cannot fly with a full cast (we searched for a while for these alleged rules and couldn't find them, only general airline guidelines that said you shouldn't fly within a few days of getting a cast) so this was our problem. When we tried to find out what else we could do and if we could maybe get the hospital that treated my friend to send an email in English that cleared her to fly, the manager speaking to us was very rude, said she was repeating herself and just walked away. Since the 3rd traveling companion and I could not afford to wait any longer or buy new tickets, we left my friend in a cast, with her wheelchair and crutches, to stay alone overnight and try and book another flight. Air Malta was obviously no help whatsoever. In the end my friend got a doctor's letter in English saying she was cleared to fly, and booked herself a flight back to Israel through another airline company (with a layover in Vienna, so this was not the most convenient flight.",,,,,
"  Flight operated as wet lease by Smartlynx (Latvia) having two additional flight attendants from Air Malta on board to overlook the board sales. Ex Lufthansa airplane. Although boarding on time, they had several minor problems, then always new paperwork and of course each time the promise that we will be in the next 10 minutes airborne. Takeoff delay about 1 hour 45 minutes, arrival still 1 hour and 15 minutes. This may happen, but it was the first flight in all my life, that had not only smaller technical problems but as soon as we were airborne also all toilets out of order at once. Not pleasure at all! Would not recommend SmartLynx. Air Malta was so far ok, nothing special but ok. And cheap, so you get what you are paying for.",,,,,
"  Vienna to Malta. The problem started when I tried to book AirMalta on their Website. After 2 days without any success I booked the flights through tripair. No chance to see on air Malta booking page whether the booking existed. Web check in impossible. I finally phoned Malta Air in Malta and they sent boarding passes to my Email address in Vienna. For the return flights the same chaos. I tried the web check in for one hours; always breakdown! Finally the girl on the hotel counter tried it by phone which took another hour (waiting in the line). Then they promised to send the boarding passes to my phone. Did not work! Finally they sent them to the hotel's email and then to my phone! The seat reservation I had made in Vienna was gone. The service unfriendly and on the plane the charged for a cup of tea and a cup of coffee 6€. A real ""Malta Experience"". They either don't understand the business or just don't care.",,,,,
"  Southend to Catania. A few miles from destination the pilot announced that we could not land to Catania due to Etna eruption and instead we would land in Malta. There are at the least 5 airports nearby Catania (Palermo, Comiso, Trapani, Reggio Calabria, Lamezia Terme). Soon after the captain announced that we would land to Comiso (Sicily) but his lack of experience did not allow him to fight against the winds so he headed to Malta. As soon as we spoke with the Luqa airport Air Malta ground staff and the Info kiosk staff we realized that we would not have any chance to spend our Christmas with our families. Air Malta staff appeared unaware of our redirected flight and was unable to answer our requests for assistance. Malta is connected regularly via ferries and speedy boats to Sicily but the Air Malta staff told us that there would have been an announcement in 20 minutes time. Twenty minutes passed and so 40 and so 1 hour and the staff from the help desk was abandoning their seats till when there was no staff at the front office. Passengers were worried, and we started asking for bottles of water and lunch voucher but they kept saying there would be an announcement in a minutes. We could have been transferred to Sicily by ferry boat or speedy boats but instead Air Malta spending time agreeing a strategy: useless to contact them by phone as the operators were keeping saying that the number was only for reservations. After 5 hours standing up, without drinking nor eating the staff told us to move at the check in desk for the flight to Rome that would land in Catania first. We moved at the check-in desk but the staff at the desk was unaware that would land to Catania and denied us to check in. After other 45 minutes standing up in front of the desk the first passenger received the boarding pass. The flight was planned for 19:00 but I received my boarding pass at around 19:45. The flight was already in extreme delay and the crew was going back and forth counting the passengers on the flight delaying even more the departure. We would have already been in Catania if the flight would have departed on time but Catania Airport shut down again at 9.30 pm. The captain went out from the cabin and called the police to force us to leave the airplane. The situation was unreal: children crying, an adult having a crisis that required the assistance of a doctor, the police shouting against frustrated passengers stressing them even more until when they started forcedly removing our hand luggage. At that point we had no option than return to the terminal. After 3 hours we received our first and only light meal for the Costa Coffee and a hotel accomodation. Nobody wanted to get stuck in Sliema because of lack of transportation (it has not been offered to us) on Christmas day so the majority decided to sleep on the ground or in the seats of the Costa Coffee in the airport. At 5 am we queued at the check-in, we received our boarding pass and we arrived in Comiso at around 8.30 am on Christmas day; from Comiso a shuttle bus brought us to Catania airport, were our parents were waiting for us. We arrived at destination with more than 20 hours delay, we stood up on our feet for more than 8 hours, we did drink for more than 5 hours, we did not eat for more than 9 hours, we will never trust Air Malta again.",,,,,
"  First time flying with Air Malta from Frankfurt to Malta and Malta to Berlin TXL using their old A320 and A319. I would say, this airline is worse than low-cost airlines serving the same route. My both flights delayed about 20 minutes. Nevertheless they arrived in-time as scheduled. What I have paid for the ticket was not equal to the service which I got. Drinks and snacks for the economy passengers are for a fee. The seats were dirty. I assume as their Airbus was a lease plane. Hence, I would not recommend this airline to fly to Malta. Better to have a stop-over but good services.",,,,,
  Rome to Malta. Was charged 90 Euro per bag at check in. There was no mention of an extra charge for checking in a bag and 90 Euro for each bag is just crazy. Will never fly Air Malta again.,,,,,
"  Gatwick to Malta. I wasn’t impressed with the airline at all. Firstly we were delayed. The airplane itself was 20 years and in bad condition. It however was a wet lease plane so there was no branding inside or any livery on the plane. The staff was weren’t great but weren’t awful, however they were below average. Then on arrival the pilots completely messed up taxiing to the gate. I decided against flying with a LCC as it’s the Xmas period I wanted more of a relaxing and customer friendly flight, none of that is what I received.",,,,,
"  Vienna to Catania. Their customer care is non existent, our plane was diverted from Catania to Malta for unspecified technical problems. 70 people including kids left with no support for 6 hours overnight in an indecent airport,  no manager showed up and nobody of their ground crew had an idea of what was going on! ",,,,,
"  This is the worst experience ever! I was flying to London and I only had the hand luggage with me. Before boarding, the girl asked me to check the size of my hand luggage and because it didn’t fit she decided to send it in the back. she asked another person to check the size of his hand luggage and same as me, it didn’t fit. But, the guy refused and he passed with his hand luggage. When I asked the girl why is this guy allowed and I am not, she said ”he has expensive staff in it” I was shocked, I said I have expensive staff as well, i will make a complain, and I want my hand luggage. She refused, saying first, the guy is from Malta and if You keep asking for explanations, she won t let me boarding anymore. I have been travelling with this hand luggage all over the world, and none of the airlines complained about the size! She shouldn’t do exception based on nationality!",,,,,
"  Munich to Malta. Old, shabby aircraft, average cabin service, no in-flight entertainment. Lost luggage for about 50 passengers! Only one person on baggage services desk, processing people very slowly. First time with this airline, but never again. In a word - awful.",,,,,
"  London to Malta. Air Malta management has lost the plot! As a frequent flyer, I used to find the airline fairly acceptable even though somewhat expensive. Sadly it's been going down-hill for a while and it has now hit rock bottom. Aircraft are shabby, service is not to standard and boarding at Heathrow chaotic. I am often forced to fly this airline due to circumstances but I definitely will fly with alternative carriers wherever possible. Wake up Air Malta and get yourself back in shape.",,,,,
"  We reported our child's car seat broken to the partner company at Vienna Airport. They processed everything normally within about 3 weeks and told us to send in our original documents and wait for a response from Air Malta. That was 5 months ago, and nothing has happened since. Not only that, but phone calls end up nowhere. I have been referred to three different phone numbers by Air Malta employees, and the last one told me that the people who are now handling my case do not have a phone number. Only an E-Mail Adress, to which I have sent a few polite E-Mails over the last weeks (not in the tone of this review, but rather in a simple enquiring manner), but never received a response. I know that baggage compensations are mostly a service and not a legal requirement, but if an airline doesn't do it, I will simply not use their services anymore.",,,,,
"  Malta to Heathrow. Travelling with my family, our takeoff was delayed 204 minutes without reason being offered though, when asked, a member of staff said ""operational issues"". About an hour of that 204 minutes was locked onboard the plane waiting for a takeoff slot. Of course, everyone was tired and bored but - and I mean BUT - the crew made things worse! No information was given, no pleasantness or courtesy was shown. They were just plain rude. And, despite the over-3-hour delay, they didn't even offer water at any point until nearly an hour into the flight. I should add that if you had paid extra to fly business class, your experience would have been better. The bulk of us in economy could see the senior steward serving the 5 (five) business class flyers with drink and food, quite repetitively while the rest of us just waited for water. And the senior steward does know how to smile! He just switches it off when he enters economy class. Really bad. Worse than Ryanair.",,,,,
"  Frankfurt to Malta. Firstly my flight was delayed. Twice. No information, no notification. Secondly, they changed my seat. Twice. No information, no notification. The second time I was already in the plane and then they just said that I have to take another seat. Our plane has some technical problems. Well, it happens. But do you think they told us something? No, all the passengers were leaved in the busses, without any information and without air conditioning. In the middle of the airport (believe me, it was very loud!). The seats are very close to each other. And I am a small person. My husband just had no space. So, they can’t solve the problems, they are not informing passengers, the plane is not comfortable, no one even tries to smile or help you. Will I fly Air Malta again? Never.",,,,,
  Malta to Bristol. The staff were friendly and professional nothing was to much trouble. Seating was very comfortable and the aircraft clean. Impressed with the complimentary light snack and bottle of water. Prices of the inflight service were reasonable. I would highly recommend flying with Air Malta one of the better airlines I’ve flown with.,,,,,
" Malta to Gatwick. The experience was pleasant. Staff are very friendly and hospitable. Even though Air Malta moved into the low cost market, service is as great as before.",,,,,
" I fly this route from Malta to Amsterdam almost every week and try to avoid Air Malta as much as possible but sometimes this is not possible, even prefer an indirect flight over a direct Air Malta flight. Recently additional surprises occurred. For months now when flying Air Malta you get a Latvian old lease Boeing, no room, fully booked.",,,,,
 London Heathrow to Malta. Excellent flight. My only commment is that boarding was chaotic. Boarding should be according to seat numbers with rear seats to be occupied first. Passengers should be asked to be seated until there numbers are called. Also elderly and children should board first. Otherwise one of the best flights I have had.,,,,,
"  Amsterdam to Malta. Had relatively low expectations but the airline delivered for me. My flight was only 30 mins late. Seats were very close together, provided snack was nasty, but the price for my flights was very cheap. I got what I paid for. Would use again, especially if the price was right again.",,,,,
" Flew Amsterdam to Malta. I always try to avoid Air Malta if possible, unfortunately sometimes I do not succeed. I prefer an indirect flight instead of a direct Air Malta flight. Air Malta is not cheap but has bad service. Unfriendly staff, bad spread of seats. Very expensive additional luggage fee. Poor food, legspace very limited and no internet check in. Try to avoid if possible.",,,,,
"  When flying from Brussels to Malta on December 27 I was once more confronted with the total incompetence of Air Malta. Official Air Malta luggage voucher was not recognized (by incompetent check-in staff) and caused a 30 min delay at check-in. Special sized luggage did not arrive with the flight (they said, but very probably badly handled by incompetent luggage handlers at Malta Airport). This is my conclusion because was found back before any other flight from Brussels arrived. Air Malta was not capable to make the late luggage delivery in time (before 17:00) driver could not be reached, and after 18:00 nobody of Air Malta answers any phone. Only after 19:00 the luggage was delivered by a driver that was not even capable to ring a doorbell or use a mobile phone, but made his presence clear by claxonning. I did not receive any calls back after 18:00 from Air Malta, so there is a general incompetence to pass any messages between staff, or even in a general sense. So even with staff quality Air Malta joins the race to the bottom of the cheapest airlines.",,,,,
"  London Heathrow to Malta was delayed but flight was OK apart from small snack and a bottle of water on offer and seat 14C not staying upright. Ground service far more professional than in Malta. Flight from Malta to LHR was a different story. Delayed by one hour but was not informed why until we boarded the flight and was told it was due to industrial action by the cabin crew. Remarkably found myself on the same plane and seat so seat was not upright during take off and landing - staff were not unduly concerned by this. Food appalling, ham and cheese square on stale bread and a bottle of water. If we return to Malta would find it difficult to use this airline again. Only reason I booked Air Malta was because I only use scheduled airlines rather than the dreaded low cost ones, and was very disappointed.",,,,,
"  Highly disappointed. Terrible service. Booked 7 months before the departure date to fly to Malta, received a phone call 5 weeks before the flight date to be told it was no longer direct and we had to fly via Germany, Munich and have a 3 hour wait each way. We purposely booked from Manchester because it was a direct flight and we had booked travel and accommodation before and after the flight, so that we could fly directly from Manchester. I asked if we could change to another airport to therefore fly direct and be compensated for the other bookings lost and they said this was not an option. Take it or leave it basically. Customers service said they couldn't offer any good will or compensation upgrade etc. I will not be booking with them again. They sold a product, then changed it only 5 weeks before with no other offerings or compensation. Aircraft itself was old and shabby with very little room. Business class also looked very disappointing, only a curtain to separate the area and priority boarding are only clear differences. Not worth the extra cost.",,,,,
"  London Heathrow to Malta. Probably one of my worst flight experiences. Very unfriendly staff, poor food and ordinary, old seats in business class. My luggage arrived at the day of my return flight, and when I requested a compensation of 65 EUR for new clothing, with the receipt included, they started to make a big issue over this by e-mail as I did not keep a document which they told me I wouldn't need. Furthermore this document is printed from their own system.",,,,,
"  I have been visiting Malta since 1985 and used several airlines in the early days it was Air Malta but they became to expensive. In 2006 I had a work accident that left me with a disability that I can not climb stairs as not able to bend my left leg and need extra room as need my leg in a semi straight position. I am however quite able to walk around a plane. All other airlines such as Monarch and EasyJet as I have a letter from my consultant supply me with an extra leg room seat free of charge. Not this company. I telephoned direct to pre book extra leg room seats on the plane and was told I had to pay this. I explained no other companies charge, the answer was we do. So to stop an argument I paid. What a con they had booked me standard seats not extra leg room and charged me for this I could have booked them myself when we got the boarding passes online. The service on the plane and attitude of the staff towards disabled people was at best poor. ",,,,,
"  What a disgrace this sad little airline has become. I fly regularly between Amsterdam and Malta several times a year and unfortunately Air Malta is the only direct option. Air Malta's aircraft are old, shabby and dirty and the leg room is pathetic! Because their economy product is so abysmal I recently decided to travel business class, what a joke! Firstly their is no business class check in lane at Amsterdam airport so this means queueing with everyone else. After waiting for over 30 minutes, I finally arrived at the business class check in counter. Why have a check in counter for business class but no separate check in lane? When I enquired about this I was met with a shrug and giggles, pathetic. Once onboard, the seat (1A) was filthy and the window covered in fingerprints and was so badly scratched I could barely see out of it. There was also rubbish stuffed between the seats. Amazingly to me there was no separation between economy and business, not even a curtain. This meant that the front toilet which is normally reserved for business class was open to everyone. For pretty much the whole flight there was a queue of passengers in the aisle. I paid over €1000 for my ticket and am absolutely shocked that this is what Air MALTA try to pass off as business class. For shame, what an absolute disgrace. This airline is an insult to the beautiful country of Malta and it's good people.",,,,,
"  The worst airline I have ever dealt with. Our flight was scheduled to leave Amsterdam at 11.30 and was initially delayed by 2 hours as our plane was in Milan undergoing repairs as there was a technical problem. After an hour of waiting and relocating to another departure gate, we were informed that our flight would not depart until 17.30. We returned to the gate at 15.30 and again our flight had been delayed until 18.30 and moved yet again to another gate. We never received one apology from the staff and were offered a voucher for a meal as compensation. Instead of 4 days in Malta our trip was reduced to 3 days owing to the 7 hour delay. Moreover, had we been informed earlier in the day that our flight would not leave until 18.30 we could have spent he day in Amsterdam rather than stuck in Terminal 2 in Schipol airport. I have used Air Malta before and experienced severe delays on this journey too. After these experiences, I will not use Air Malta again. No professionalism, no efficiency and no apologies.",,,,,
"  Malta to London Heathrow on 16 February. Online check-in worked fine and showed up at the desk to get a paper boarding pass. Agent friendly and jovial - easy airport to get thru security and plenty of places to eat. Boarding the plane was nice as there are no jetbridges and we just walked from the gate to the plane. A320 with comfortable seats. After boarding mechanics got on the plane and there was a speaker that wasn't working so it took an hour to fix. In the mean-time a FA came to me and asked me to move from 7A to the emergency row window as he said they needed someone to sit there. Never been asked to move to an emergency row but was fine with it. Tons of legroom and a row to myself. Once airborne we were served drinks and a sandwich for free, then they came around with BOB. Just a moving map but enjoyed the views outside of Sicily and the alps. We landed 20 minutes late but quickly off the plane. Air Malta is a nice little airline - hope they continue to grow.",,,,,
"  On my flight from Berlin to Malta Valetta I had a boarding card for the seat 2F issued by Air Malta. At the time of embarking on the ground staff checked and accepted my boarding card. When I sat down I realized that this seat is bigger than the others so I was happy. The stewardessess checked 3 times my boarding card and gave me back saying OK. At fourth time another steward asked my boarding card and said this is an error and I have to go to row 23 but she did not give me a new boarding card. She said that the plane was reorganized and row 2 was in fact Business Class, and I had an economy class ticket. After I was re-seated, nobody was at row 2!",,,,,
"  Flew Air Malta from Gatwick to Malta for the 1st time on 28 October. Flew with them as they included 20kg baggage and they had a mid morning flight as I hate to arrive any where after dark. Flight was due to leave at 1155. Display boards said gate information at 1105. Checked at 1105 and it now said information at 1715. Went to airline desk who were not that helpful only saying food vouchers would be provided. Finally took off at 1845 or thereabouts. Captain apologised said the Incomming flight had tech problems and that they had to change aircraft. The aircraft was clean, cabin crew friendly, one guy went out his way to help the couple in front of us with a child in distress. Inflight meal was a snack but fine when the flight is only 3 hours. Arrived at our hotel about 1230 am woke up late so effectively lost a day of our holiday. I guess these things can happen I had a similar experience with Thai Airways years ago, that caused us to miss connecting flights and taxis. Flight home no problems same clean aircraft good cabin crew. I would use them again and would not tell any one considering to fly with them not too. However I was disappointed in the lack of information at Gatwick and the indifference of the staff at the airline desk. I guess a lot of passengers will b claiming delay compensation under the EU 216/2014 rule myself included. Wonder how airlines make a profit on a flight when it goes like this one.",,,,,
"Flew Air Malta, 7/10, Gatwick to Malta. What a disgrace. Plane late on arrival and they did nothing to speed up the turnaround. Seats (row 5) exceptionally small and clasutrophobic. Onboard staff in a bad mood and not good at serving. Sat behind the Premium seats which meant we had a twee red curtain drawn for the flight in case we offended these important beings. (There was only one man in this class on this flight). The stewards were so slow serving the snack - tiny roll and a bottle of water - so that when people needed the loo (we have to use the one at the back) we couldn't get to it. We therefore used the first class one and got told off by the stewardess. I quoted health and safety and suggested she looked at the rules and regulations. The only good thing about it was it was a short flight speeded up by an even shorter route. Never again. ",,,,,
"This was the first time we have flown with Air Malta. I have to say this may be the last time too. Had a fantastic holiday until we got to the airport to come home and had a 7 hour delay, no communication on why or what was happening. When the information desk was asked they didn't know either. When they finally had some information all they said was 'it's a tech issue'. I know these things happen but it's the lack of communication all round that's most upsetting. Yes we had food and beverage vouchers. The plane was due to leave at 15.00 but we were late again leaving. The plane had seen better days that's for sure. The onboard snack had a lot to be desired, a roll and a bottle of water. A really disappointing day completely wasted sitting in an airport with no communication.",,,,,
" London Gatwick to Malta with Air Malta. What can I say, but all in all a poor effort on all fronts. Delayed leaving the UK (30 minutes) and seriously delayed leaving Malta (7hrs - having left the hotel at 6:30am to catch the 8:50am flight). We missed our connecting flight home and had to book a a subsequent later flight at an additional cost to us. They have a serious lack of communication, albeit we got vouchers for food and drinks. As always they will not comment on what exactly went wrong other than 'it went tech'. These things happen, but it would be nice to inform you as soon as possible and then keep you updated and just do it as required according to the EU rules and flight delays. Even when we were told the flight would be leaving at 3pm - that did not happen. The plane itself, looked tired it been through a lot. The seating cramped, when compared to our Island carrier - Aurigny and their Embraer E195 a regional carrier. How is this possible? Also, upon vacating the seat I noted how the cushioning remained depressed. Obviously a well used seat. Generally the interior of the plane although clean, it too looked dated. The lack of inflight entertainment is a poor effort. The food: poor effort once again, a filled bread roll and a bottle of water, I would rather not bother, in fact I didn't. When you consider Aurginy you will have at least a choice of soft drinks/tea/coffee and of course water. This is certainly not a experience I wish to repeat, it ruined a perfectly good holiday. Ultimately, if we ever returned to Malta, I will ensure my family and I choose an alternative carrier.",,,,,
"  Rome to Malta. I fly with Air Malta quite often and I have always been completely satisfied with their punctuality. They are usually also the cheapest legacy carrier to get you to Malta, at least from Rome. They have a nice magazine called Il-Bizilla (Maltese for lace) providing interesting information. Planes feature small overhead screens with the usual airshow. Cabin staff are hit-and-miss and sometimes quite grumpy. Unfortunately, the aircrafts' interiors are also quite old. Seats are tired and on this particular flight, the seat pocket was still full of trash. Complimentary food consisted of a small roll (Maltese-style tuna sandwich) and a bottle of water with additional choices available against payment. Completely adequate for the 1h long flight. They are always my first choice when it comes to flying to Malta. I know that they are going through tough times, but cleaning the plane properly should not be too difficult.",,,,,
"Malta to Milan Linate - I frequently travel with Air Malta. It is a comfortable option and offers really good prices. Usually flights are on time, cabin crew are very friendly, I really like the fact that bags fly free and Air Malta gives you also a free snack (bottle of water and baguette). Will use this airline in the future.",,,,,
"Flew EasyJet in February which was ok but used to prefer major airlines so flew KLM to Amsterdam (great) then Air Malta to Malta. So you pay top whack for this airline which used to be average a few years ago but now no hot meal or drink, hot drink available at an inflated cost and the tea was vile and no hot meal even at a cost, even Easyjet can manage this. What you do get free, and this is listed on the ticket as a meal, is a bottle of water with no cup and a roll, I was the only one of a party of four who ate mine. And so to the airport, no cases, Air Malta or Schiphol? Still waiting next day, should be here by 11 pm. Air Malta staff indifferent. Easyjet from now on then with no transfer, Malta still my favourite destination though.",,,,,
"Munich to Malta. Good friendly service and on time arrival. The aircraft was modern and I liked the random Maltese facts painted on the inside of each engine. When I first sat down in my seat the plane had been configured wrongly and my economy seat was in fact in business class. Once the passengers were all seated the crew reconfigured the aircraft and moved the curtains further up. This meant that we couldn't see the screen displaying the safety and emergency procedures video. The food was very limited and if we wanted anything more including coffee there was an extra surcharge. Overall, though this was a perfectly adequate airline.",,,,,
"These guys really don't deserve to get your business. I tend to use many different airlines and also use low-cost airlines, accepting that I will receive less service for the money I paid. I had my struggles with some airlines, but I don't recall being as disappointed as I have been with Air Malta. First they cancelled my flight two weeks after I booked it - of course without letting me know any reason. I was lucky enough to get an alternative for the same day, stopping over in Munich. Besides the additional stop that was not even a detour, but was so early in the day that it got troublesome already (since we were staying at the neighbour island Gozo and having to catch a ferry before the flight). Four weeks later they inform me that even this new flight got rescheduled and starts even one hour earlier. When asking for an alternative flight the customer service lady told me that they won't offer me any alternatives as the rescheduling was less than two hours. When pointing out that my original flight was planned seven hours later, she said as I had confirmed the first change, I am no longer eligible for objecting against the change. So I have to accept every rescheduling from my changed flight plan if it is a change of less than 2 hrs. I had to let go off our last day on Gozo, had to find a new hotel near the airport (for a family of 5), had a ruined day with sleep-deprived kids and an endless wait at the connecting airport. ",,,,,
"Back in the day Air Malta used to serve us a nice hot breakfast, lunch and dinner depending what time of the flight. Flew London Gatwick to Malta. Now the airline serve us a sandwich and a drink of water for free. Just to warn you in the future make sure you eat a lot at the airport. When I was younger Air Malta used to have inflight movies, now it's just a live map. ",,,,,
"Having travelled with Air Malta since 1988 many times and recommending them,  I can no longer recommend them. I was due to travel to Malta in June 2015 but was unfortunately diagnosed with breast cancer and had to cancel my holiday. After contacting Air Malta and having to practically beg them, they agreed to hold mine and my partners flights so long as I travelled before 31st March 2016 and provided evidence which I did. I have recently finished my treatment and am now ready to travel. I phoned Air Malta to re-book and was informed that it was 80 euro for each of us to re-book. I explained that I had been off work for nine months and could not afford it and I would not be able to go and they said sorry, cannot help. I emailed customer service to be told the same thing. I could understand it - if I merely cancelled my trip but in the circumstances, they could and should be more sympathetic. I have been to hell and back this past year and to have to deal with this is so distressing. Air Malta does not care more as their logo States, it should say does not care less. I will never use Air Malta again.",,,,,
"I took return flights from Gatwick to Malta for a short vacation and was happy with service on both flights. The onboard and ground staff were polite and helpful. I appreciated the checked luggage allowance and the free onboard snack, something you often don't get in economy. The prices in their Sky Bar Menu for paid for food and drink were very reasonable also. ",,,,,
"Very disappointed with Air Malta. Flew with my daughter and grandchildren from London Heathrow to Malta. Although flight departure was at 7 pm, we were only served a bread roll and bottle of water! Had to pay extra for any other snacks/drinks and they are very expensive. No entertainment whatsoever. This was quite an expensive scheduled flight [approx. £2,500 for 5 of us], and have had better cabin services from much cheaper budget airlines.",,,,,
"I was disappointed with Air Malta, the flight to Algeria was not a cheap one despite the short distance, one week before my flight they cancel it and fly me to Germany and transfer me to another airline from there. I found Air Malta service appalling and unfriendly, crew and ground staff tired and fed up, plane is new but a bit shabby, they only serve sandwiches on board with a tiny bottle of water! ",,,,,
"This flight was to have been a direct flight from Malta to Venice booked in December 2014, for a June 11th 2015 departure, we were going to leave on a cruise from Venice. Five weeks before the date I was phoned by Air Malta advising my flight had been cancelled. This is not unusual for Air Malta to cancel scheduled flights and they were very clear they did not have to give me a reason. My options to replace this 2 hour flight was a total of 11 hours via the UK, or Vienna or another far off destination, which also meant I missed a day in Venice and had to pay Euros 138.00 just to arrive at my hotel at midnight. I was told no compensation either. My only other alternative was a refund. I managed to arrange for a flight via Rome. Taking a connecting flight with one of the Air Malta partners I would possibly fly with them if there was no other option, but a stand alone flight I would not.",,,,,
"Paris to Malta. The ground crew were very helpful at the gate since I did not have any seats assigned by Air France because their computers had a glitch. The cabin crew were not a happy bunch, your felt as though you had crashed their party. They did the minimum and one of them was actually quite abusive, apparently that is acceptable according to Air Malta management. The flight itself was smooth, on time and a nice landing. They should not waste their time serving the buns and water. Not my first choice to fly with taking into account the numerous other carriers available at the same or lower fares.",,,,,
"This Air Malta flight from Venice to Malta went well. The only problem is the ground crew at the airport did not call for boarding at any time. Fortunately we were sitting by the gate and noticed a last boarding sign. The flight was comfortable, on time, the crew on this flight was very nice and helpful. The food as usual a bun and water is not very nice. Because of other problems with Air Malta I would not fly with them again just because this flight went smoothly. I just can't take that chance again.",,,,,
"Good clean comfortable aircraft, disappointed that they have stopped serving meals, although you do get a small baguette and a bottle of water. Very expensive for a flight in early Oct. Cost me over £320 pounds, Ryanair about half that price but I could not get to the airport. Flight back delayed for an hour which caused me problems.",,,,,
"I requested assisted boarding and seats together for my disabled husband and I, and they sorted it all within 24 hours. We found the Air Malta cabin crew very pleasant and efficient. The snacks of a ham and cheese roll and bottle of water may not have been a cooked meal, but were more than other airlines provide. Tea, coffee plus other drinks were offered for sale, as were snacks. All in all I found Air Malta excellent. We will fly again with them next year, hopefully.",,,,,
"Air Malta flight, from Malta to Gatwick. The aircraft was showing its age Tight leg room. Unfriendly and disinterested staff on early flight.",,,,,
"The outward leg was on an A319, seats were narrow and the legroom very poor. The seat in front was about 9 inches away from my face and it was impossible to read a newspaper when the seat in front reclined. The food was a roll with ham and cheese and a bottle of water. In the past we had a hot meal, drinks and coffee, so this was a disappointment. The cabin crew in comparison to my previous experience seemed dispirited. The return journey on an A320, seemed slightly more space between seats but the dreaded ham and cheese roll with water was the only food on offer again. I read in the Malta times that they plan to reduce their fleet to 7 aircraft, this will surely result in long delays if one of their ageing planes has a technical faul.  There is much written in the Malta press about their airline but surely a fleet of 7 is not viable.  I would not fly with the airline again .",,,,,
"I have flown with Air Malta countless times in the past years. I can say, with all honesty that the airline has proven to become worse and worse every year. The evidence is not only in the small leg space available but the atrocious meal provided. A 4 hour flight to Moscow and only a sandwich and a bottle of water. It's abysmal. Air Malta used to provide hot meals with a choice of water, juices and soft drinks, and afterwards a cup of tea or coffee. What happened to this airline? I am sorry to say but nothing about it makes me want to use the service again. A note to the airline - It would be a good suggestion to pay just a little bit more for the flight and it would have a decent meal included.",,,,,
"Acceptable, but cabin showing it's age. Seats are a little tight, but good recline. Overhead Flight Map and Inflight Magazine acceptable for 2 hour flight. Water and a Baguette - stay away from the Tuna-fish Sandwich, the turkey one is fine. A big disappointment from their previous offerings. It would be better to stop serving rolls and replace them with a snack (peanuts, chips, ect) and soft-drink instead.",,,,,
"Long waits and delays, poor check in service, they had lost our booking. If you try to eat the cardboard bread roll you'll need the bottle of water, take your own inflight movie, as there is none.",,,,,
"KM4207, KM4206. 26th May - 2nd June 2015. Quite disappointed really with mix up and confusion. Flew from Cardiff, five of us travelling to Malta, got to check in and told that if we all want to sit together they would charge £25 per person. Lots of customers complaining! If you request extra leg room at a cost you will be in charge of the emergency exit, no one with any disabilities or under 16 cannot sit in these rows. I had a 14yr old and she was moved!",,,,,
ORY to MLA and MLA to LIN. When I purchased the Air Malta flight ticket it stated a hot meal will be provided. But onboard I only received a bread roll and a bottle of water. I don't understand why this airline decided to downgrade their service it is not much different to travelling on a budget airline except you get a refreshment and a free piece of baggage. The aircraft livery is beautiful seat was comfortable for a short haul journey the only thing that might make me use them again is the location of airport they fly to.,,,,,
20/2/2015-23/2/2015. Flight KM 612 to Rome KM 613 to Malta. I have flown with Air Malta from Malta to Rome Fuimicino and return to Malta. The flight was OK but food was very poor. The service which was provided in Rome was very bad: at the check-in the machine did not know how to fill in the boarding pass normally Be aware: a lot of students are flying on this route and they make a lot of noise especially during boarding.,,,,,
Travelled to and from Malta this month. We cannot understand how the market research dept. have come up with the plan to remove the hot meal from this service. We travelled 2 hours to the airport 2 hours waiting and a 3.5 hour flight landed us in Malta about 11.30pm. All this time without a meal! I think it's Easyjet next time.,,,,,
LGW to MLA and return - January 2015 - A320 both ways. Although online check in used there was no dedicated bag drop at LGW which somewhat defeats the point when you have to line up with those who have not checked in. Outbound flight left 10 minutes early and landed 25 minutes ahead of schedule. Air Malta have now discontinued a full meal service in favour of what they describe as a baguette and a bottle of water. The baguette is actually a small soft roll with very little filling. Due to a cabin crew dispute over crew meals being discontinued no hot or cold drinks or snacks could be bought. On the return the dispute has been resolved and a selection of cold snacks hot drinks and full bar service available at prices slightly lower than most low cost carriers. Return was about 15 minutes late. As both flights were lightly booked there were plenty of free seats which made the trip note comfortable but A320's are showing their age.,,,,,
Manchester to Malta A319 22nd December 2014. Check-in was slow which was a bad start and it got worse. Our economy seats had minimal legroom and when the passenger in front put his seat back just after take-off I was trapped. There was no entertainment system other than a map showing the planes location and the meal of chicken curry with a bread roll and tiny mince pie was embarrassingly poor. For a scheduled flight it was pretty bad and the best bit was leaving the plane on arrival at Luqa.,,,,,
MLA-LHR. Flown Air Malta many times but this was by far my best experience. Same price as flying Ryanair. Crew very courteous breakfast was standard and impressed that a European airline still serves hot meals. Only downside in my opinion is that the aircraft are showing their age on the interior in particular the seats. They are only 10 years old but a cabin refit would have been of more benefit to the airline than the paint job they all had lovely though it is.,,,,,
The seats were so close together that it was difficult eat or read the magazines. My wife who had arthritis and osteoporosis had great difficulty getting out of the seat to go to the toilet. The distance from the front of my seat to the seat in front was only 9 inches. I feel that Air Malta has forgotten what passenger comfort means. I have been to Malta three times this year twice with Air Malta and once with Easyjet which was by far the most comfortable flight. As much as I would like to support Air Malta I am sorry but in future I will be travelling with Easyjet.,,,,,
" The comments in the review of my outward journey about food and beverages (good), cabin crew (efficient but rather distant), and on-time performance also apply to this 12-hour overnight return flight from Mauritius. The biggest difference was a turbulence-free flight this time so that I was able to sleep soundly for 8 hours. The seats in the A330-900 are the same as used in the A350-900 so this confirmed that, for me, they do the job nicely! If I was being picky then I'd say that a more substantial pillow would have been welcome. I can't comment on the in-flight entertainment because I went sleep straight after dinner and just enjoyed the view out of the window from breakfast until landing, but my wife found some films to entertain her. It was interesting to compare Air Mauritius' A330neo with their A350 and, to be honest, I didn't notice a difference. They are both comfortable, quiet aircraft with 28 seats in 1-2-1 configuration in business class so for this punter they were interchangeable.",,,,,
" A good 11.5 hour overnight flight with on-time departure and arrival, marred only by a very long period of mild turbulence (just one of those things, not the airline's fault) and the cabin temperature being rather high for my liking until the final couple of hours, which combined to make my night's sleep less satisfying than I'd hoped for. The dinner and breakfast were very good and choice of drinks OK -- only 2 white and 2 red wines but the ones that I tried seemed to be good. The cabin crew were efficient and effective, if not especially engaging. I found the lie-flat seat comfortable; others have said that a mattress would be welcome and that would certainly be very pleasant, but I was not conscious of joints between the seat cushions and (being a man who always prefers a firm bed anyway) it was soft enough for me. Note that Air Mauritius uses the Plaza Premium lounge at Heathrow T4, which is nothing to write home about. Hopefully they will find a better option when they transfer to Gatwick later this year.",,,,,
"  My experience with Air Mauritius was the worse I ever had with an airline. 12h delay announced 3 days before the flight from Kuala Lumpur Mauritius. 24h delay from Mauritius to Kuala Lumpur. no compensation for hotel room, transportation, or inconvenience. Customer service is overwhelmed with basic request like Delay letters for insurance. You call the hotline, you get redirected to 3 different offices. They do not answer their emails in the delays announced (21 days announced and they can't even make it) you have to call and chase them to get an answer. The delay letters are extremely generic and do not tell the reason behind the delay so most insurance companies will refuse Avoid at all costs",,,,,
"  Our flight to Johannesburg was delayed for 7 hours and the airline staff in Mauritius assured me they would make arrangements for our connecting flights to Gaborone as well as accommodation if we had to spend the night more so that we were business class passengers (there were 7 of us). When we got to Johannesburg the airline staff changed their story and said they could not be of any assistance to us and just left us and knocked off. Worst of all we did not get our luggage and the airline made no attempt to help us track it. In the end we had to book accommodation at the airport, spend the night without our luggage and buy new connecting flight tickets to Gaborone the following day. Air Mauritius showed no remorse for the inconvenience coupled with the fact that no apology ever came from their side.",,,,,
  This is the worst airline I have used they are the Ryanair of long haul. We were a party of 36 we pre-booked seats at a cost of £100 for the round trip. Food was poor. Seating was awful. Entertainment was shocking no latest films some of their offers were 15 years old. WiFI not working.,,,,,
"  The flight was fine and on time. I had only one concern shared by many co travellers: the air conditioning is not working or set properly. The inside of the cabin became very stuffy. We did ask during the first flight to have the temperature set lower but it was still far too hot and uncomfortable. The seats are also very close, making it extremely uncomfortable to eat.",,,,,
"  Overall quite pleasant experience in business class seat 2A. Two hours late leaving Heathrow due to a technical issue caused by the push-back truck, no fault of Air Mauritius. During that time, the air steward and stewardess came around with more champagne and small a packet of snacks, and kept us updated. Once airborne, the service started promptly with delicious meals and attentive service from the air steward. The catering out of Heathrow is delicious and a lot better than coming from Mauritius. The catering from Mauritius needs improving. Seat is quite spacious, however I found it quite hard when sleeping. British Airways business class seats are more comfortable and have better padding. I only managed to get a few hours’ sleep. Perhaps Air Mauritius should provide a mattress-topper like to put on top of the seat to provide more padding as they do in other airlines as part of their turn-down service. The air steward was very polite and addressed me by name. No wifi was available on that particular aircraft. The air steward said that it was the only Airbus A350 of the fleet which didn’t have wifi. I would recommend this airline. The cabin product could be better but the cabin staff makes up for it.",,,,,
  Worst airline experience ever. Flight delayed by 6 hours. No announcements at all. Staff not sharing a clear picture of the scenario. Made to wait in queue for a small food packet and bottle of water for 40 minutes. Total waste in management as the staff serving food packets on ground is not aware of the situation.,,,,,
"  I am very impressed and pleased by Air Mauritius. The aircraft was very modern and well equipped, and the service was amazing. I have never experienced so welcoming and attentive service during a flight. Additionally the food was amazing. I usually do not enjoy meals on flights that much but this time it was delicious. Well done! I am hoping to fly with you guys again one day.",,,,,
"  Very good service, seat is okay. I cant make any remarks because its economy. Good staff and prompt. Airport staff at check in wonderful, kind and speedy, and 30kg checked in baggage + hand luggage.",,,,,
" Paris to Mauritius. Rows of seats too narrow, no legroom - crammed together like in a cage. WiFi is only offered against payment. Unfriendly staff and not available for night flights. Must have slept by yourself. No food, just something indefinable cold. You got a voucher to get yourself cold food in a shop at CDG airport, and that on a flight of more than 11 hours. Not a normal continental breakfast, but rather something indefinable. The only point of light, the flight captain. Great flight and landing. Airline not recommended. ",,,,,
"  My flight was cancelled over a year ago and I'm still waiting for a refund. Appalling customer service, nobody can help, nobody knows anything. I was told that the company is in administration and that I have to wait until early 2022 for a decision on the refund. Despite that, they are still selling flights (as of 04/09/21) and offer refunds on their website, 'Condition of carriage' section. I will certainly never fly with Air Mauritius again.",,,,,
  In March 2020 my flight from Mahe to Mauritius was cancelled by Air Mauritius so it's 17 months and I am still fighting for my refund.  In their last email I was informed that I have to wait till January 2022 and then they will make their decision regarding my refund. I am not going to risk my money booking my flight with Air Mauritius again.,,,,,
  Staffs were not professional and the service on the plane is very poor. The entertainment system don't have much options either.  Online WiFi don't work. Contacted the airline a few times to complain but never got any response back. This speaks volume about there service and how they value there customers. I'll never use this airline again.,,,,,
"  Mauritius to London Heathrow This was an unexpected and emergency flight back home due to the Coronavirus and booked at very short notice following advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in Mauritius due to the Border closures given the situation. In addition, the Kenya Airways / Qatar Airways flights to Nairobi and Doha / Manchester were all cancelled due to the Coronavirus, as the airlines were not flying on these routes, with no availability to travel until at least mid-April (this now appears unlikely as the Mauritius authorities have imposed restrictions). We were informed this was the last commercial flights to UK from Mauritius, so there was no option but to book and look to recoup costs back from Credit Card company give the crisis situation. This was reflected in the cost of the one way ticket to London Heathrow. Never have I seen Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport so deserted and quiet. However check in was easy. Boarding was a little chaotic, as this flight was full (this was a concern as it was impossible to evidence concepts of social distancing in the flight as would be expected given the impact of Coronavirus, though I wore a face mask for majority of the flight). Cabin crew themselves were dressed with appropriate Protective Equipment (PPE) for the 12 hour flight to reduce risks of infection. The flight itself represents an improvement from the last time I travelled with Air Mauritius some 25 years ago !. Cabin crew were kind, friendly and attentive and service has improved. The meals sadly are of poor quality. Lukewarm, with little in the way of decent portion size (though they provided my Vegetarian Special meal). Bread was stale unfortunately, and the dessert was an odd combination of rice and sugary milk ?? Menus were not provided, which is a shame. The inflight entertainment is ok, and the flight map and routing was good. Unfortunately could not connect to the complimentary WIFI online, as it would not recognise my booking details. In summary, definite improvements noted with Air Mauritius which was welcome. The new Airbus A330neo is a lovely aircraft. Pilot gave timely announcements. Sadly the toilets were not being attended to (perhaps more due to some of the ignorant passengers onboard whom have no empathy for the airline or the crew).The only deficits as mentioned was the meal quality, otherwise it was good. A great shame I could not get a connection back to Manchester (due to the Coronavirus, but good a rental car for a quick 3 hour drive to Manchester Airport from Heathrow to collect my car and get back home). I would travel with Air Mauritius again if need be - most likely from Mauritius to destinations such as India, Malaysia and local regional areas such as Reunion Island, Rodrigues and Seychelles. As for long haul, it’s ok, but 12 hours with Air Mauritius is a bit too much and will revert back to Qatar Airways or Emirates for future travel between Manchester and Mauritius. But in summary, a pleasant experience.",,,,,
"  Perth to Mauritius. Travelling with Air Mauritius was a nightmare. Need to upgrade to better planes, uncomfortable seat, my lunch/meal was unsatisfactory. Flight supervisor not professional, no smile, with attitude, the other attendants were all amazing.",,,,,
"  Mauritius to Perth. I was quite appalled by the quality of both the dinner and breakfast options, and the old movies onboard. For dinner, I had tasteless vegetable, chicken rougaille and rice and for breakfast we had a slice of cake.  No snacks were offered during the flight.",,,,,
"  London to Mauritius. Excellent experience, even though we diverted to Madagascar. We were nearly landing in Mauritius when the plane diverted to Madagascar due to a cyclone. Air Mauritius provided shuttles to an Ibis hotel, covered all the buffet meals while we were there (and accommodation). There was a lack of shuttle buses so many people had to wait long periods to reach the hotel. We took a taxi and paid ourselves, which was a great idea. The room and food was arranged without us requesting it, so we're grateful for that. Communication was good in terms of catching a flight the next day to Mauritius. Legroom was good on the flight. The food was inedible, which is my only complaint. Airline staff was lovely, friendly and accommodating. All in all a great trip, they handled the delay well and will definitely consider flying with them again.",,,,,
"  We were supposed to fly on 29th December. Due to a cyclone in Mauritius, the flight was first delayed, then eventually cancelled. Air Mauritius did inform us the first time, but the second time, everyone had already arrived at the airport. We were standing in line when we got notified that the flight was delayed, and then cancelled. Then we were informed at 1 am that the flight is scheduled for the 31st December at midday. We finally went through the boarding gates, took a bus to the aeroplane, and there we were - all standing on the 'runway' outside the aeroplane, waiting to board. We were outside for probably 30 minutes, then sat in the plain for another 40 minutes, without any communication about what is going on. When we finally took off, the captain apologised for the delay, but with no reason as to why. We had to ask the air hostesses every time if we needed something to drink and then they looked at us as if we were asking for something that was not allowed. They were unfriendly to us and not hospitable. When the food arrived, they ran out of the chicken option and only had fish left. My husband's fish was undercooked. When we arrived in Mauritius, we were once again stranded on the runway, without any busses, staff to communicate with or any means of getting into the airport. We were standing around for some time until we finally got picked up by one bus. We waited for more than an hour to get our luggage. On the flight back, although we were delayed by an hour, the service was a lot better. Drinks were offered all the time and the staff was friendly. Very inconsistent service. Air Mauritius did not contact us at all about the delay, asking if we would like to extend our stay or offer any discounts because we have now arrived almost 3 days later and missed out on the short time that we had on the island. Car hire was and accommodation was affected. I understand that this was an act of God, but it's all about customer service.",,,,,
  Shanghai to Mauritius in August 2019. Our flight from Mauritius to Shanghai was scheduled the day of. They didn't bother to let us know until we were already checked out of our hotel. They did not make any effort to reimburse us for our meals even though we had to stay in Mauritius for an extra day. We had to jump through hoops just to get them to pay for our hotel for an extra night. I would never recommend this airline.,,,,,
"  Mauritius to Mumbai return. The food is ok on departure but they served stale buns. The seats are comfortable and flight attendants are nice and helpful. The flight delay by 1 hr we were sitting in the plane with kids, nothing served until 23.30, our flight were supposed to take off at 21.20. Returning from Mumbai was the worst meals served on this flight. Priority for meals should be given for kids first, not those who ordered.",,,,,
"  Perth to Nairobi via Mauritius in June/July 2019. Their check-in baggage allowance of 23kgs is a hit below the belt to say the least. In-flight entertainment needs a serious upgrade  as movies and TV shows were outdated. Cabin crew were friendly, but most of them mainly spoke in French. They were the cheapest airline at that time of the year, and they offered 2 free nights at Hennessy Park Hotel during transit, because they have limited flights to Nairobi.",,,,,
"  Mauritius to Paris. The legroom was huge for an economy seat. The seat was very comfortable and the crew was super nice. The entertainment was great, a lot of movies, series, music. The meal wasn’t that good but it was okay, and the ground crew wasn’t very present for us, and boarding was a little messy. It was a very nice flight.",,,,,
"  Paris to Mauritius. The plane was new, clean and comfortable. The entertainment was good, but insufficient charging ports for electronic devices. The meals (dinner and breakfast) were good and plentiful, much better than our previous flight on Air Canada. The flight crew were friendly and helpful, and the flight which was eleven hours, was pleasant.",,,,,
"  Mauritius to Paris CDG. Check in process was slow with long queues, even though I was using the priority check in queue, only two desks were open to handle 4 Air Mauritius departures, in total the wait was around 40 minutes to check in, however when I finally got to the check in desk the process was efficient. The lounge experience is detailed separately. At the departure gate, the process was chaotic. There were 9 gate staff standing around but only two actually doing any work. The staff were unfriendly and didn’t want to engage with the passengers. They gave the impression that they didn’t want to be there doing the job and did not come up to the Air Mauritius standard for customer service. This lowers the overall rating given. The gate staff began releasing passengers before the crew were ready to receive them. I was the first passenger to the aircraft and had to wait on the air bridge for 5 minutes while the cabin crew finished their cabin preparations. Once on board, the cabin crew were what I had become accustomed to with Air Mauritius, they were friendly, welcoming and helpful and are a credit to the airline. This A340-300 was one of the refitted aircraft and the cabin was very nice. This aircraft now has lie flat beds in business and the interior is now similar to the A350, minus WiFi. Seats are comfortable. Food and beverage service was good and the food was surprisingly delicious. The departure time was 22:30 so it was late to eat a main meal, but non the less it was good. Breakfast was served 90 minutes prior to landing and was adequate. It’s difficult to make airline breakfasts anything special. I didn’t use the IFE but there did appear to be a good selection of films to watch.",,,,,
"  Paris CDG to Mauritius. My first flight with Air Mauritius and generally speaking I was impressed. The aircraft was an A350 so the aircraft is relatively new, which is always nice. The business cabin was roomy and comfortable. Food and beverage service was good as was the quality of the food. Unfortunately WiFi which is complimentary for Business class passengers, was out of service, which was disappointing. Seats are lie-flat bed type and are comfortable with enough space. Inflight entertainment was ok, there was a good selection of films etc. The boarding process at CDG was chaotic and very badly organised. At MRU, ground services were excellent and speedy. Generally speaking very impressed with the Air Mauritius Business Class experience and this is highly recommended.",,,,,
"  Mauritius to London Heathrow with Air Mauritius. Efficient check in once computer problems solved. Flight ok, seat uncomfortable as with all economy class. No regular water supply despite dehydration risk. Very good overall, will definitely use again with knowledge gained. Much much better than BA. Like the service, like the staff, need to expand film choices out and back. Music could be better. ",,,,,
"  London to Mauritius in March 2019. Flight was cancelled last minute and we took off only the next day. We lost a full day and when we tried to be compensated, no answer it took 4 months before they came back to me saying I'm sorry we can do anything but next time you can have access to the salon. I was business class so I always have access to the salon and priority check in and I won't go back there. Food was average, comfort below average. The only positive was the service on board. ",,,,,
"  On May 20th me and my partner flew from Amsterdam to Mauritius on board one of the A340s of Air Mauritius (Economy class). I’ve read some bad reviews about the airline and its aging A340s, but I was pleasently surprised actually. The flight departed on time, and the loadfactor was around 70-80 percent. The legroom was sufficient, and the seats were comfortable with a nice headrest en decent recline. Even when the person in front of me reclined the seat I didn’t feel cramped. The only downside was the lack of IFE, as around half of the PTVs on board weren’t working. The cabin crew was very friendly and professional. Both meals were tasty (dinner and breakfast), but were a bit small. As I slept most of the flight I’m not sure how the service between the meals was. Conclusion; I was surprised by the quality of the flight, and it will be even better when the A340s are finally upgraded (set the be done later in 2019).",,,,,
"  Cape Town to Mauritius return. Both flights very good in terms of cabin service, friendly engaging and polite crews, food OK (ex CPT) to good (ex MRU), plentiful drinks rounds, seat space, VOD quality (although very small screens). Both flights on time, quick baggage retrieval on arrival and a breeze through immigration + customs in both CPT and MRU. Would definitely fly Air Mauritius again and glad to have paid a little additional fare for non-stop flights rather than transferring via JNB.",,,,,
"  Kuala Lumpur to Mauritius via Singapore. This is a 'trying' airline. They try, but they don't quite get it right. I had 4 flights with Air Mauritius. 1 was cancelled without notifying me and then rebooked for a departure a day later, another delayed by 3 hours and the aircraft substituted with a smaller plane. As a result of the plane substitution, all pre-arranged seating allocations were scrubbed and worse seats allocated instead. The inflight entertainment didn't work and to top it off, my partner and I were asked by the purser to move so a 10 year old boy could sit in a very slightly different configured seat with his mother to the one that they had been allocated. No other passengers were asked to move. Ground crew and on board crew carried out their jobs in a perfunctory and robotic manner, going through the motions, but not really caring at all. The inflight fish curry meal was good. The web site provides limited and misleading (or no relevant information at all) particularly in relation to updated seating maps and airline lounge arrangements.. When I called the Service Centre I was told that when I arrived in transit from Australia into Kular Lumpur on an Air Mauritius code share I would have to collect my baggage and recheck it in. This was incorrect, as was the information I was told as to which airline lounge to use. All first world problems I suppose... and perhaps not the biggest of issues for an airline from the third world. Service was passable and safety good, but nothing more and cannot be recommended. One of my flights was on an A340 which was looking very dated, particularly from an inflight entertainment (tiny screen) and seat comfort perspective (rigid, won and uncomfortable). I would definitely avoid that type of aircraft on a long route.",,,,,
"  Shame on you Air Mauritius: flight MU0843 (Mauritius to Cape Town) postponed twice without any explanation (technical issue means everything and anything) nor possibility to take another flight for South Africa the same day. Spent the night in a nightclub going motel and forced to cancel all my meetings for today. When we ask for partial refund of the tickets we get the following answer ""it’s not company policy"". Be careful people before booking with Air Mauritius",,,,,
"  London to Mauritius. The worst flight, we was flying as family. Seats was so small, 38C, D E. Aircraft was so old, it had ashtrays there? My husband was moved to other seat after we told staff about his DVT, but they only acted after we decided to get off from this plain. Seat was so small I actually ended up standing for half of the flight because if person in from of me reclined his chair and I couldn’t seat move my knees was trapped.  It’s was so cold too, other people was cold too not just us. I hope air Mauritius will scrap this aircraft as soon as possible.",,,,,
"  Singapore to Reunion via Mauritius. I've flown with Air Mauritius for more then 30 times but this was the worst experience. First there was no connecting flight from Singapore to Reunion, I was told to book a hotel in Mauritius and stay over night. Bad experience, the flight was delayed for 30mins, then an announcement was made that more information will be announced at 11am. My flight scheduled for 10am was cancelled but only at 1pm the announcement was made. How can one spend so much more money in Mauritius than the flight ticket itself.",,,,,
"  Mauritius to Paris. We had flown the outward journey from Amsterdam on a KLM Boeing 787 and I had wanted the opportunity to fly in the A350 to have a personal comparison of the two aircraft. My wife and I were really pleased we had chosen the A350 for our return journey; it is more comfortable, stable, roomier and significantly quieter then the 787. I slept for five hours during the overnight journey from Mauritius having failed to sleep at all during the outward 787 journey, also overnight. So, thumbs up for the A350. The service throughout the return journey was excellent, from the staff at check-in to the lounge staff and the on-board staff. Food was excellent, the fish dish served at dinner every bit as good as any of the several fish meals I had enjoyed on the island. Well done Air Mauritius and well done the A350.",,,,,
"  Johannesburg to mauritius on the A350-900 ,all were good except that my 7 years old daughter was not on the list for souvenirs as other kids on board were. My main concern is my return flight Jan 18 2019 on the A319. I’m a 90kgs guy and my nightmare started once the flight took off with the front passenger who decided its time to rest so she leaned her seat backwards. I was squeezed, even the magazines I couldn’t read as the space was very tight. Arrived the time for lunch,the hostess served her and didn’t inform her she need to put her seat back to its normal position, I’m the one you did it by tapping on her arm to please move forward so I can eat properly. She wasn’t very happy by me asking but I couldn’t care more as I paid to travel. I saw the hostess distributing a small backpack bag to the kids then again nothing for my daughter and I asked this time,what the criteria to qualify to receive? Was told my daughter wasn’t on the list. Second time no souvenirs. Was told they would post them to us but didn’t mention which year. Until today Sunday feb 03 there is no updates from Air Mauritius about it.",,,,,
" Mauritius to Rodrigues. Horrible service! I sent numerous emails, I phoned the recovery department so many times regarding my flight which happened 3 weeks ago (which was delayed by almost 5 hours). And nobody even had the decency to answer one of these calls / emails! In my opinion the department does not even exist, even the manager is MIA. The only option I have is to call call-centre agents who are not even capable of directing me to the right person, they just pass me through to another department. One of the agents even told me that it's easier for me to go directly to the office in the capital to talk to someone from the department. I wonder why they have phones to begin with. The customer service is really poor! They'll definitely be there to take your money, for the rest, not so much. You definitely won't get anywhere close to what you paid for. Stay away!",,,,,
" My wife and I have just travelled London Heathrow to Mauritius and return via Virgin holidays. Having read a number of reviews criticising the airline, I was a little apprehensive about our flight. No need to have worried. As an economy class passenger, I found the service as good as any airline I have flown with. The food was acceptable, the service from the crew was as good as any. The aircraft was old and the seat size was small. The ground service was again as good as any airline. In conclusion I would not hesitate to fly Air Maritius again.",,,,,
"  I was apprehensive to begin with when booking Air Mauritius but decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately, my concerns were proved right. We flew them from Perth to Johannesburg, with a 3 day stopover in Mauritius. Upon arrival in Perth, we discovered that the inbound flight was cancelled which meant an overnight stay in Perth. The replacement flight was due to leave at 8.30am the following morning. Upon arrival to the airport we discovered this had changed to 9.30am. 20mins after boarding was due to start, the flight crew stroll into the airport lounge, none of them worrying or rushing to get going, the end result being a further 90min delay to an already 20hr delay. Upon boarding the plane, we sat down in seats that had an entertainment system from the 90s, not even worth having there. On board service consisted of a snack and drink, followed by lunch and a drink shortly after. We did not hear from the cabin crew again for another 5hrs (prepare to be thirsty). Even when pressing the button for flight crew service, nobody came to my seat to assist, with flight crew even walking straight past the service light on the panel above the seats. The end result of this experience was a planned weekend in Mauritius turning into a single day. Very, very disappointing.",,,,,
"  Mauritius to Johannesburg. Not only did the airline staff let us know that the flight 15 min later, 2 hours later and we are still waiting for our flight without explanation. As someone traveling with a baby and had to be at the airport at 5am I find the service absolutely ridiculous. What a let down!",,,,,
  Mumbai to Mauritius was delayed due to late arrival of the incoming aircraft from Mauritius. During check in we were advised that the departure was rescheduled due to the late arrival of the aircraft to Mumbai. We were also informed that because of this Refreshments would be served at Cafe Indiana from 05:00 hrs onwards. The ground staff were very courteous and patient and displayed professionalism while dealing with the passengers. I could see them interacting with the other passengers and again at around 07:45 hrs they made an announcement that those passengers who wanted more coffee/ tea and refreshments could approach the counter.  Enjoyed the flight.,,,,,
" Mauritius to Johannesburg. The food was appalling, disgusting and it tasted like left overs from couple of days before. Canned food taste much better. Even the staff was speechless when I showed them how bad the food quality was. The only option they had for me was some Pretzels. I can only have Muslim meal and I was Not the only one with the Muslim meal option who complained on that flight. Too much for a coincidence to me. Purchased my ticket to travel by SAA but unfortunately ended up in the disappointing Air Mauritius. What a shame",,,,,
"  The attitude of the cabin crew has improved. The quality of films has improved as well but the screen is abysmal so one cannot really see the film. Or for some passengers around me, their screens were not working at all. But what is disgusting with this airline is if there are delays and communication. The communication of the on ground staff is appalling - first they do not know how to handle angry passengers, they do not know how to keep the passengers updated and the airline does not have a CRM (all complaints fileId directly with the airline will go into a black hole - not even an acknowledgement of receipt). It is an unpredictable airline - if you manage to get onboard, service is ok but if something goes wrong such as cancellations (which happen very often) or long delays, then only God can help you. The only choice we have on this route (direct flight) is British Airways and therefore, if you have the choice, it is preferable to avoid Air Mauritius.",,,,,
  Paris to Mauritius. Amazing experience compared to my flight from Toronto to Paris. Smooth flight with a very soft landing. Amazing on board staff providing caring service. Food was excellent and breakfast superb. I am very proud to see the effort which is put by the staff to make the trip for passengers remarkable. Thank you for ensuring excellent customer service provided to travellers.,,,,,
"  Mauritius to Singapore. Flight was cancelled 3 hours before departure. No update was given to know what was the way forward - especially since a connection was involved. When you call Air Mauritius, the people were rude, and could not help at all. It took 7 hours of timeless wait on the phone, without someone to even lodge a decent complaint to finally get redirect to another flight combination, with inconvenient timing. They do not even get the emails right. No compensation for the delay - no apologies for the inconvenience. No miles, no upgrade, nothing. It's as if we need to be grateful that they actually redirected us, for a ticket which we have paid for! The service on board was below standards compared to the price, but I never knew that the on ground customer service was so lousy as well.",,,,,
"  Mauritius to Chennai. Since the plane was overbooked, I was upgraded to business class. My first notion on the journey was that it would be a hectic journey as I has to travel overnight. But the attendants onboard the aircraft made sure to keep me as comfortable as possible. The seats were excellent, cabin service was outstanding. Staff was well trained, polite and professional. I would recommend flying in the business class on this airline.",,,,,
"  London to Mauritius. In July 2017 myself, my wife and 2 children aged 1 and 3 travelled to Mauritius. As a regular kestrel Flyer, I expected better treatment and better service. They are very child unfriendly.  When we landed, one of our luggage was missing. This is despite the flight was the flight was delayed by more than one hour. We landed on a Sunday, and had to attend a wedding the same night. My wedding clothes and that of my wife were in that luggage. I complained to the staff, they could not care less and said I was not entitled to anything and was sent away. No manager was available and later in turned out that the duty manager on the day was busy attending to the Prime Minister's wife in the State lounge and could not be bothered about paying passengers. I complained to their customer service, and the service I received was poor. I wrote to the CEO and their Chairman. No response at all from them. When we returned to the UK 2 weeks later, two Air Mauritius Staff were travelling. They were being given business class treatment when they were travelling in economy in front of paying customers. I spoke to the cabin crew about this, and they could not care less. What they offered me is 5000 travel points, 50 Euros, and to use their lounge when I travel next which is pathetic to what my family went through travelling with them. ",,,,,
"  Paris to Mauritius. The food was good (chicken, fish and special meals). The entertainment on the plane wasn't good (little screen with 18 channels and you couldn't choose a movie). Another issue was the leg space, a problem when you are bigger than 180cms. The cabin crew was friendly and can speak at least 3 languages (French, English and a native language). When you have a question, they will try to help you with a smile.",,,,,
"  I travelled from London Heathrow to Mauritius. I was expecting comfort but things have not changed. Customer service at the check-in desk was nice and welcoming. Customer service within the flight was nice too. Negative - Seat was very uncomfortable (for an average guy of 6 feet). Leg space under the seat in front of you is awful. There was a black box next to my feet. Arm rest was painful, food below average. Cold tea / coffee served and I had to complain. Entertainment was poor. The new movies contained strictly old movies. Overall, people only travel with Air Mauritius because it’s a direct flight however I have to say that this service is not good value for money.",,,,,
"  Mauritius to London Heathrow. Really good flight, Check in very quick and easy followed by swift Fast Track immigration. At 6'4"" I always find the seats a bit difficult but was surprised that these Old Type seats were very comfortable in sitting mode and also sleep mode. Not Lie flat but fine as I managed 9 hours sleep. No dinner for me as the flights are evening 2200 departures and I do not wish to eat that late. Woke in time for breakfast which was OK. Looking forward to the A350 on this route soon. Entertainment very old and not worth bothering with, staff were very friendly but still do things the old Mauritian way.",,,,,
  After a bad flight a few years ago I decided to fly again as they are the only non stop flights from Heathrow to Mauritius. Glad I did despite the old aircraft I managed 9 hours sleep and found the seats more comfortable than expected as they are not flat. Didn't have dinner but woke early for breakfast which was very good. The crew were friendly and smiled except for one. Looking forward to my return and looking forward to the new aircraft A350 at the end of this year. Only problem for me is the chaos at Heathrow boarding gates (gate 8) as Business Class passengers are unable to see the signs or even get through the chaotic crows! Maybe an announcment would be helpful or heaven forbid maybe one of the many managers standing doing nothing at the gate could assist?,,,,,
"  Singapore to Mauritius. The worst flight experience. We should have flown on a Budget airline to Mauritius for a better experience! There was an hour delayed departure out from Singapore and the aircon in the plane was not working.  After take off, my husband's entertainment system was not working and we press the call bell and no one attend to us. I have to walk to the galley to inform crew about my husband's entertainment system not working.  After informing about the unserviceable system and I doubt he did anything because they were more concerned about meal service.  Finally we get hold of another Stewardess and inform her and she said she will do it later as she was occupied.  When we receive our tray, I informed the 3rd crew again about the entertainment system and she said she will reset again and doubt that it will work. She offered a seat change but we paid for the exit row (USD50 each) to enjoy the extra legroom instead of having to move to another seat behind and be separated. There were many announcement throughout the flight duration.  First meal service was rushed and after that lights switched off within 2 hours.  Our holiday mood to Mauritius was dampened by the experience with Air Mauritius.  ",,,,,
"  Paris to Mauritius on May 1st. Had a great experience, flight boarded and left on time. The staff were very pleasant, friendly and extremely helpful. The food on board was good and the flight attendant came around several time for beverage. The one negative comment I would have to say is the individual screen have seen better days. I understand it's an older aircraft, but something has to be done about those screen. overall Air Mauritius provided an excellent service and have impressed us. Good job",,,,,
"  We travelled with Air Mauritius two days ago for our honeymoon from Cape Town. We were bitterly disappointed in the lack of service and unfriendly staff. We waited 2 hours before being served a drink and ended up getting our meal at the same time. The entertainment system did not work for half the flight. When we asked for some water, we were forgotten and we had to get up and ask again, even after ringing the bell to alert them. To top it off one of the air hostesses rolled her eyes at us on three separate occasions: when she had to give way to us in the passage, when we asked her to remove the empty cups and when my husband needed the bathroom before landing. Not a great start to our honeymoon! Very disappointing! We are due to fly back on the 20th April, let's hope we are better received this time.",,,,,
"  A319 from Cape Town to Mauritius and ATR72 between Mauritius and Réunion. The staff was not friendly. They serve the meal without watching you, don't expect any smile.  The food was poor. The A319 looks old inside, no modern entertainment like personal screen. On the ATR its the same, but flights are short so it's not a problem. The real good thing with Air Mauritius, is the number of lines from Mauritius. And prices are correct. I know the company is going to change some aircraft soon. A good thing for sure. Let's hope that will bring back smile on crew's faces too.",,,,,
"  We were traveling to Mauritius for my sons wedding. It started off a nightmare leaving Melbourne on a Qantas flight - we had so much terrible boarding the plane, as there was a mistake made with my name on my tickets (different from my passport). After a few hours of stress trying to resolve the situation, and the stress of not knowing whether I could board the plane, it was resolved.. In Melbourne they said I would have problems in Perth when I board Air Mauritius. At Perth we went to the Air Mauritius counter fearing the worst. It was not the case. A beautiful lady there helped us. She made us feel at ease right from the start, even had a little joke with us, and she fixed the problem straight away with no drama. She also gave us an upgrade - we were blown away! Thank you Air Mauritius.",,,,,
"  Mauritius to London. Checkin was chaotic leading to long queues with not enough staff to deal with it and looking visibly unhappy too. It took about 1.5 hours to get to front of queue for checkin. We boarded late only then to sit for about an hour in swelteringly hot and airless cabin before takeoff as the auxiliary power unit was not on, probably to save the airline money as the crew were unwilling to say more than they were suffering too and encouraged me to complain to the airline. Once again, staff unhappy and unmotivated. Requests to talk to senior crew member were ignored and they only came to answer my call button to switch it off, muttering 'later' or words to that effect. No choice of breakfast offered but what came was the most unappetising on any flight I have ever had. The entertainment was very outdated - tiny screen with picture shaking so much that it was unwatchable. And also poor choice of films. On the plus side, the seats were relatively comfortable but only for normal-size passengers. On our outbound flight, the rather large gentleman behind me was in visible pain due to lack of room for his girth/legs. Not that the stewardesses offered any solutions. Luckily, I found another seat so I moved instead to give him more room. As our chosen seats when booking had been unceremoniously reallocated to others by the time we checked in (another first experience for me) this wasn't too much of a hardship.",,,,,
"  Mauritius to Perth. Flight to Mauritius was delayed for 2 hours. No explanation, then was cancelled with no warning. A guy from Air Mauritius came out and yelled over the top of everyone saying flight has been cancelled come back tomorrow at the same time, then just walked off like that. No one knew what was going on or what to do. Then when we returned the next day the flight was delayed a further 4 hours with the same poor service. Now on my way home flight is delayed a further 2 hours with the same appalling service. What a joke of an airline and the staff need to work on their customer service too!",,,,,
"Mauritius to Durban. Luckily we sat in the front row with the babies and kids. The legroom was excellent. However the legroom for the other seats I noticed was miserable. Tall passengers with their legs in the aisle. Aircraft was clean, crew very friendly and breakfast excellent on this 4 hour flight. However after 1 month I still have not been credited with my miles in my Air France account. Pretty annoying.",,,,,
"Johannesburg to Mauritius with Air Mauritius. The nicest cabin interiors which make you feel that you are already at the beach. Very friendly staff; excellent legroom. Quite a decent meal for a 4 hour flight. Audio and entertainment worked and cabin was clean. The flight left and arrived on time. However South African Airways staff who weigh the bags for Air Mauritius were a pain, though we were only 2 kilos overweight on one bag. They blamed it on Air Mauritius though SAA flights also watch the exact weight.",,,,,
"Mauritius to Delhi with Air Mauritius. I booked emergency seat, 27H, but the legroom was not great. I had the emergency slide on front of my legs. Seats are very uncomfortable. Good thing about this airline is that you get free spirits (when you ask). The main reason I have chose this flight was because it was direct.",,,,,
"  London Heathrow to Mauritius with Air Mauritius. Staff was helpful and friendly. Food was very average. Entertainment was very tragic. This route uses the old style entertainment system Which plays a set number of films on loop. Inflight entertainment system was old and not flexible and the screens were unclear. Bad quality monitors and headphones, nothing was to actually see and hear. The seat were uncomfortable, very little legroom. They lost my luggage, no one knew why or where it was, we waited 5 days for luggege without any information from the Air Mauritius what happened, when we could expect it . We got 2000MUR (ca. 40 GBP) as atonement, but it was enough only for a swimsuit and shampoo. We do not recommend this airline at all.",,,,,
"  Flew London Heathrow to Mauritius. Great service from Air Mauritius, seats ok, inflight entertainment not so good, food ok at best. Travelled from London Heathrow a week before on a 747 when service was again excellent, food really good, inflight entertainment ok but big downside were seats where legroom was poor. I believe 747s are being replaced in next year or so. Service at airport check-in at both airports was very friendly, helpful and efficient. Luggage all arrived. Pricing was competitive. I would use again.

"  Singapore to Mauritius. Air Mauritius is frightfully expensive.  I paid twice as much for this 7 hour flight as I paid for a 22 hour flight trans-pacific on another carrier.  I take my hat off to the cabin and ground crew,  they are well trained and in most cases love their jobs. Their smiles are genuine and are attentive to passengers (or to me at least!). The aircraft has seen better days. Entertainment system was old and screen was small. I don't even watch TV. No wi-fi. Seat Livery could do with a makeover - looks a little chintzy, though you can tell it was inspired by the colors of Mauritius, the seats being turquoise to match the natural lagoon. Staff were well-dressed in navy jackets, white shirts and really awesome rainbow scarves.  Food wasn't bad. I think I had some stir fried veggies and rice (Oriental Vegetarian meal). Was hoping they'd surprise us with Haagen Dazs ice-cream but they didn't. Do you want to go to Mauritius? If you do, I recommend Air Mauritius, as it's the only way you can get there.",,,,,
 Mauritius to London Heathrow with Air Mauritius. Staff are perfectly friendly. Food is poor with the business class meal very average. No snacks available during the flight except the packets of pretzels which the staff went to get me from economy class. Entertainment is poor. This route uses the old style entertainment system which plays a set number of films (about 4 English language options) on loop. The seat is average - old style business class angled flat but with nice cushions. Route and timing is good - on time and direct to London is great.,,,,,
Flew Air Mauritius from Mauritius to Paris. Old plane but it was clean. Crew friendly and helpful and service was good. The food could be better. Space was acceptable. Inflight entertainment system was old and not flexible and the screens were unclear. For us not so important due to the fact that it was a night flight.,,,,,
"Mauritius to Kuala Lumpur and return with Air Mauritius. Check in was smooth and efficient.  Flight was half full. Flight attendants pleasant and helpful. Food was ok, but was better on inbound flight. Entertainment was adequate for the flight with AVOD. Seat comfortable for 7 hour flight, regular drinks service by crew. a small snack was served before landing, which could be improved. Overall, it was a good flight.",,,,,
"Perth to Mauritius was excellent. Day flight, very pleasant FA on my side, (the one on the other side clearly was not happy to there) great food. The trip back was a little disappointing. They ran out of my choice of food (fish) and instead of informing me and suggesting something else on the menu, they decided of give a disgusting, tasteless staff meal! I didn't know that and they only told me about it when I returned it untouched. In fairness, they then asked if I wanted something else. Way too late guys! Of course, by then I was put off by the whole thing and decided to sleep instead. No flat bed is provided and for the price you charge is just not on Air Mauritius. Shame on you! Flight Manager was a welcoming and very pleasant. Honesty and transparency is the best policy. Always inform the passenger first. ",,,,,
"Mauritius to Beijing with Air Mauritius. Very smooth check-in, immigration and security procedures at MRU airport. The A340 aircraft was a bit old but comfortable enough. Extremely good service by staff onboard and discrete meals. On-flight entertainment system could be improved but overall a very good experience.",,,,,
"Perth to Johannesburg via Mauritius, and on the 4 flights I took in the last month I am most impressed. I flew with a 3 and 4 year old which I thought would be challenging but it wasn't. The crew were attentive and thoughtful, food delicious, drinks never ending, and the amenity kit great. The kids got packs (different) on all 4 flights. Kids meals were age appropriate and delicious. IFE a bit dated but enjoyable nonetheless. The only reason I don't score full marks is because of the seats - what is up with that crazy weird seat?",,,,,
"Mumbai to Mauritius return with Air Mauritius. Somewhat dated aircraft with very sad IFE. The flights were on time, seats were comfortable, food was decent, and they still hand out amenity kits. Not exactly fabulous, but it's fairly comfortable. Wouldn't mind flying with them again if they ramp up their frequencies up a bit.",,,,,
"Paris to Mauritius and return in Business class with the family. A good experience even if a somewhat dated plane with angled seats and a dated entertainment system (although with well curated but limited selection of films). Charming and attentive cabin crew and very kind to our children without any exceptions on both legs. Okay food and drinks selection at an average business class level. AF lounge in Paris in okay. All in all, a good value for money option to Mauritius.",,,,,
"I was pleasantly surprised with Air Mauritius. The aircraft was clean and the flight attendants very helpful. The entertainment system is a little dated, and the seats are a little narrow. The meals going out were okay, but on the return journey not so good. Plenty to drink through the flight. Take off and landing excellent. I usually suffer with my ears but had no problem on this trip. I would fly with Air Mauritius again.",,,,,
"Air Mauritius A340 has the worst business class seat ever. The seats do not lie flat, and you tend to slide down on them - tired and dated with plenty of signs of wear. Inflight entertainment is old and dated -  no news or games programmes/channels. The cabin crew cannot be faulted for trying. I wonder if Air Mauritius have ever bothered reading these reviews - I would not have thought so; they've got your money, so why would they worry?",,,,,
"Totally disappointed with the flight outbound, dated aircraft, in light entertainment was ridiculous all the films started at the same time with no option to rewind or pause. The meals were bland, you'll not starve but that's about it. we couldn't book our return seats online, we tried several times but no results, but thought nothing of it, but this morning once the 24hrs online check in opened we logged in 3 mins after it opened and all the seats were booked. So me and my partner couldn't even be seated together. I'd never fly with Air Mauritius again, I'd rather pay a few pounds more and have a happy 12hrs in the air.",,,,,
"Return flight from London to Mauritius in business class. Friendly, welcoming staff on the whole, and good service. Good food and excellent champagne and wine offerings. The main issue is the business class seat, which does not lie flat, and leads to interrupted sleep. Business customers have access to the Skyteam lounge at Heathrow which is excellent. The lounge at Mauritius is reasonable, but the food offerings there are poor.",,,,,
"London Heathrow to Mauritius with Air Mauritius. This was the most uncomfortable journey I have ever taken. There was no leg room and the seats were unforgiving. Good value for money, but so are buses.",,,,,
"London Heathrow to Mauritius return, and we had no problems both ways. Cabin crew helpful and smiling. Food wasn't. We did check in online both ways and this so efficient going through bag drop. We felt the Airport in Mauritius was amazing, the downside to our outward journey was that another passenger became ill 2 hours before we landed. The captain called for medical staff to assist which as both my husband and I are nurses we assisted, but luckily there was a trauma consultant on board. Unfortunately the poor man died despite efforts to resuscitate him. It appears that the Air Mauritius aircraft only had a facemask but no ambu bag and no defibrilator. The cabin crew appeared calm and reassuring to other passengers and treated the deceased man with the utmost dignity when they took him to the back of the aircraft.",,,,,
"This Air Mauritius flight was awful. There is very limited leg room due to a metal box taking up most of the available leg room beneath the seat in front.  Impossible to get remotely comfortable on the flight. No sleep was had due to very uncomfortable seats and constant cabin announcements. Badly designed and old plane. Inflight entertainment system poor. Service poor. Food awful. What a shame as we love Mauritius but with no option but to fly from Perth via Air Mauritius, we will not be returning until they have upgraded aircraft. Or perhaps there is another direct carrier.",,,,,
"Air Mauritius is appaling, whilst on holidays (I am Mauritian born) the airline and its associated problems were in the papers on a daily basis. I got home with marks on my knees (even though I have a baby which kept me in and out of my seat - entertainment system did not work on 2 of our 4 seats - delayed for 3hrs in terminal due to technical difficulty. Ground and inflight staff were extremely unhelpful, trying to carry sleeping baby and two toddlers no one offered help - passengers were offering help.  Aircraft is cold, with atrocious service , we had food on the trays for ages whilst trying to move around in a limited legroom. Flight staff barely cared and when asked to assist appeared to be indignant.  I am extremely disappointed of with Air Mauritius , it does leave a good taste for tourists.",,,,,
"The seats on this Air Mauritius flight were old and grubby, and the leg room poor. A good point was the seating layout of 2x4x2. The staff were polite and reasonably helpful. The inflight entertainment was poor and the screen was so small I had to wear reading glasses to watch it. The worst thing was the food - on the flight from Heathrow to Mauritius the food was just about acceptable, but coming back was dreadful. The dinner we left most of it and the breakfast was so dreadful that neither of us ate it. We have flown with many different airlines, but none have been as bad as that. On the flight home we were delayed 29hrs and were not informed until we arrived at the airport, then we were taken to the Holiday Inn by the airport. There was no apology or compensation for this inconvenience",,,,,
A truly awful experience and one as a family we have no wish to repeat by flying again. It was a daytime flight and all the cabin window shutters were kept down and the lights kept down so we flew in darkness - we asked the purser to put up the lights and blinds and we were told he could not do this. There was obviously bright sunshine outside but we were subjected to flying in darkness. The food was truly awful - I am not expecting haute cuisine on an economy flight but we were served pap. We have eaten good food in Mauritius but no attempt was made to serve reasonable food - no fresh fruit - it is a tropical island and I believe an attempt to serve a slice of pineapple is possible even on a tight budget but the salad that was presented was ghastly. The bread rolls were as stale as bricks on all three meals presented - watch your costs but don't bother presenting it to customers as a meal. Just because they have a tray to fill with their little boxes for a 3 course meal doesn't mean the customer should be treated as a fool! The whole experience was a shambles and can reflect on the island of Mauritius as a destination. The airline is getting it wrong by subjecting customers to this kind of service/experience in this day and age.,,,,,
We had to travel from Mumbai to Mauritius. Air Mauritius flight MK749 got cancelled on 17/7/2015 10 hrs before departure without an alternate flight arrangement. We had to book tickets from Mumbai to Mauritius via Dubai. Return flight of Air Mauritius on 21/7/2015 MK748 to depart at 2120 hrs was rescheduled late by 3 hours at last moment without indication to passengers.,,,,,
Singapore to Mauritius. The crew were sleeping with covers on their head at the back of the plane which were far from a warm welcome I was expecting. However crew were helpful and fairly good for inflight service. Return leg did not meet my expectation - Air Mauritius delayed for 2.5 hours and was not helpful to change my connecting flight KL-Singapore. The ground staff in Mauritius was very poor in service for check in - took over 45 mins only for me.,,,,,
"We were pleasantly surprised by the service and overall comfort of the trip. The cabin staff were professional and friendly and the food and beverages top class. The accommodation arranged for us by Air Mauritius at the Airport Holliday Inn was top class. Thank you and well done, looking forward to our next trip on Air Mauritius later this year.",,,,,
My wife and I booked business class from Cape Town via Mauritius to Paris (return). The 5.5 hour flight from Cape Town to Mauritius was essentially in economy seats with an arm rest in between the seats with a partial recline. The 12 hour flight from Mauritius to Paris in a A340 was in a reclining seat except that it is not flat so you end up sliding down the seat with your feet getting squashed against the seat in front of you. The airline assured us that this leg of our journey had flat beds which is certainly not the case. The inflight entertainment is a non entity and probably the worst we have experienced.,,,,,
LHR-MUR return as experienced business travellers there are certain things we expect. We were originally flying BA until they changed the schedule meaning a loss of a days holiday unacceptable when you only have 7 so we changed to Air Mauritius which to be frank I was dreading! Check in fast and efficient fast track through customs as you would expect. As a small airline the lounge is shared with other airlines. A real let down next to no food choice wine etc ok Emirates it wasn't. Once on the plane business seemed reasonably comfortable until you try to sleep the seat doesn't lie flat but sloping to the floor. I'm 5ft 9 and my feet were rammed into the seat in front I didn't sleep a wink all night. Having said that food reasonable wine flowed nicely we couldn't get our TV to work my husband slept most of the way I had a very long night. Return ok lounge very nice food less appealing on the flight home very weird combinations we had 2 full dinners and afternoon tea halfway through. Got the TV to work this time but film selection rubbish.,,,,,
Flew Cape Town - Mauritius - Perth Business class. The flight from CPT to MRU (A319) is more Premium Economy than business with extra legroom economy class seats (3) with the middle seat blocked. There is no individual IFE on this flight. MRU - Perth (A330) full business with slight inclining beds. Service was good and the food lovely and plentiful with matching wines. Business lounge at MRU airport very good. Would fly again.,,,,,
A pleasant surprise on this MUR-TNR flight in a 340. Comfortable seats (for a 2 hours flight but in no way a lie flat) nice staff proper food and wine. Much better than my previous flight NAI-MUR where I paid business fare to be seated on a coach seat (and the crew told me it has not changed): this is why I would not recommend this airline.,,,,,
The staff on the AM plane's do no more than the bare minimum service wise how many times does a customer have to ask for a glass of water? When you get the water its in a plastic cup and its warm! Their own pre flight customer care video states that consuming water is suggested for all flights! If only you could get it. Then there was the seating smelly old uncomfortable and zero leg room. I am 175cm tall and I was looking for space! We flew overnight leaving at 22.00 and the lights in the cabin were off for all of 3hrs in a 8hr flight! What also annoyed us was excessive the use of the PA! They love it everyone has a go the captain the assistant the FA captain and assistant and the toilet cleaner. Give it a rest no one listens to the announcements especially when we are trying to sleep!,,,,,
The seats were narrow and leg room poor. A good point was the seating layout 2x4x2. The staff were polite and reasonably helpful. The inflight entertainment was poor and difficult to get to work. The worst thing was the food on the flight from Heathrow to Mauritius the food was just about acceptable. Coming back was dreadful. The dinner we left most of it and the breakfast was so dreadful that neither of us ate it. We have flown with many different Airlines none have been as bad as that.,,,,,
Flew from LHR-Mauritius-Perth return with my husband myself and 22 month old son. We weren't looking forward to the flights especially as our son didn't have a seat so was sitting on our laps but all 4 flights were fantastic. We were very lucky that on the 3 of the flights the plane was empty and both ground staff and cabin crew made sure we had a row of four seats so loads of room for a little one to stretch out. I thought the seats were comfortable enough far more leg more than on our flight with Qantas whilst in Australia. The cabin crew were very friendly polite and helpful. They weren't snotty about us walking our son up and down the aisle which we have experienced with other airlines Qantas being one of them. The bar seemed to be open for the entire flight which unfortunately we couldn't take advantage of being responsible parents and the food was nice. I would recommend Air Mauritius their customer service was excellent which helped travelling with a child a very unstressful and relaxing experience.,,,,,
LHR-MRU April 13: Tight seats and small IFE screens but overall an adequate level of service. Friendly flight crew. Food unspectacular but okay. MRU-CDG April 21: Same tight seats but bigger screens for IFE. Everything else the same as outbound flight.,,,,,
"My husband and I and two friends travelled to Mauritius. They had our pre-booked return seats not reserved. We were kept waiting an hour before booking in. The ground staff were rude and arrogant and we had ring our travel agency in England for them to confirm we had paid for the extra legroom seats all to no avail we still never had the seats! The food was disgusting aircraft really cold the cabin crew extremely unhelpful. Other passengers were unhappy with the service and sent the food back Even writing to customer services once we were home they were exactly the same not in the least bit interested. I would rather travel with one of the ""no frills"" airlines at least their staff are pleasant.",,,,,
We flew from Cape Town to Mauritius on 27 March and returned to Cape Town on 3 April 2014. The crew/staff were lazy and totally disinterested in passengers. I did not see a staff member for over 30 minutes. No respect for their passengers. Will never fly Air Mauritius again.,,,,,
We recently travelled as a family of 5 from Melbourne to Paris and London Return (Perth - Mauritius - Paris London - Mauritius - Perth on Air Mauritius). We found the airline to be no frills and got us from A to B efficiently. My complaints are the economy class seats on the older Airbus A340-300s operating from London and Paris to Mauritius were worn uncomfortable and had a terrible entertainment system I struggled to sleep the whole 12 hours. The newer Airbus A330-200s operating the Mauritius to Perth route was more comfortable and had a better newer entertainment system though the particular flight we were on was packed full and quite uncomfortable for an 8 hour flight. The cabin crew did their job but did not go out of their way to offer any additional service. The food service onboard depended on which route you fly on the Parisian route we got a decent curry dinner and a refreshing French breakfast but on the Perth flight we only received a bland meal at about midnight and a horrible hot (vegetable substance) in a bread roll for arrival when all we felt like having something refreshing I noticed a large majority of people did not eat it. In the end it was an ok airline and would recommend it if you are stopping over in Mauritius.,,,,,
We flew from London to Mauritius and Mauritius to Perth. We had our 16 month old daughter with us and the staff were great. Food was ok seats comfy. The land staff even gave us 4 seats for 3 of us from Mauritius for more comfort.,,,,,
MK748 MRU-BOM A330 with Air India code-share. One-way ticket to attend a family wedding in India after holiday in Mauritius. Air Mauritius is the only direct flight on this sector and it is code-shared with Air India. The ticket is cheaper if booked under the Air India code-share flight number than the MK one. Mauritius Airport and the Air Mauritius lounge is excellent. Very pleasant crew on the MRU-BOM sector. Economy class seats reasonably comfort. The exit row seats cost more and are available at check-in but crew very kindly assigned them to us as they were empty. Inflight entertainment is adequate with a range of movies and music albums. Meal was a full Indian service with 2 choices and all the usual accompaniments. Would recommend this airline on this sector. Only gripe is the 5am arrival in Mumbai but smooth arrival process as airport is often quiet at this time.,,,,,
"Not a nice experience between Perth Mauritius and Paris then return. The seats were too close to the ones in front and were some of the smallest I have ever travelled in. The video was not working and nothing could be done which made the 26 hour travel time even longer. I had asked for a ""lactose intolerant"" meal on all legs of the journey and none was forthcoming which means that I did not eat for the whole journey but still paid the same fare as others who had full meals and proper entertainment. I will never fly with these people again and suggest that others also avoid this airline.",,,,,
Recently travelled to India on an Air Mauritius flight back and fro on MK748 and MK 749 respectively. However I am very disappointed by the services offered on board. I travelled together with my spouse and infant of less than 2 years old. On departure on 27th December we requested a baby cot (ticket booked on 11th November 2013 - more than a month before) and on check-in same was requested again and approval obtained. However to our disappointment we did not get one on board. The reason given was that the baby was too big for the cot and the weight was too heavy. The infant weighs: 10.3 kg and his height is 73 centimetres. The crew did not even bother to check if the infant fits the cot or not but bluntly refused. We had to hold a crying baby whole night which not only disturbed us but we had an earful from other passengers. On our return (10th Jan 2014) same scenario. Despite request no infant cot and even worse we did not have a front seat to handle a baby. Instead we were put on a seat with other seats in front which was really uncomfortable. I and my spouse had to carry the infant whole night. There was another couple who benefited from a cot and we tried it on my infant and he fits perfectly well. In fact we had more rooms than expected. When I told the cabin crew they told me that you are not in a front seat and hence cannot give you one now. (The irony is that a cot was requested and approved at Check-in in Mumbai). We did not even get an infant meal on both trips. The service we got on the flight was very disappointing and frustrating. I am frequent traveller on Air Mauritius and as from now I will rather use other carriers for my overseas trip be it personal or business related. A very disappointed customer.,,,,,
The aircraft was on time from Manchester and on the return journey from Lourdes (Bartres) the aircraft left early. The staff were a bit distant the food good overall OK.,,,,,
TLV-TLS. Flights were on time the plane was clean inside and the seats were comfortable but there was not enough legroom. The crew were very friendly and professional. We got tasty sandwiches and drinks. Take off and landing were excellent. We will recommend.,,,,,
Glasgow to Lourdes this journey proved all the negative reviews I had read about this airline to be spot on. Plane arrived at Glasgow four hours late after which we eventually boarded. Our troubles were just about to begin. After counting the passengers on the plane at least half a dozen times the cabin crew asked passengers sitting in the front seats to move to the back Caused great inconvenience and lost time. We arrived at our destination approx seven hours late - and five hours late going home.,,,,,
"Paris to Tel Aviv with group of around 35 (charter) no problems. Return a week later - big problems. Flight due to leave around 2100 delayed as plane had not yet left Paris. No explanation. After several false starts finally informed no flight until next day. Agency found us a hotel (very good). Next day after a few time changes finally left at 1930. Explanation of previous day's problem: mechanical and crew unavailability. Crew aboard our flight ""volunteered"". Good people lousy company. Too small and probably not profitable enough to meet obligations. Surely destined to close shop before long.",,,,,
"For a return flight from Paris to Mopti Air Mediterranee proved horrible from start to end. Despite several calls to their customer service center in Paris no-one could tell us what time the flight left nor from what Paris airport. In the end the flight left one day before its originally scheduled departure in the afternoon from Orly instead of CDG the originally announced airport. The leg-room in the completely full flight was pitiful and as a woman a little above the average European standard my legs were constantly hitting the back of the person in front of me. In spite of the trials of the flight to Mopti the worst part of the flight was still the return. Calling the airline on the day before departure they could tell us departure time was moved from 0900 to 1200. No information would have been given to us had we not called. However the airline still insisted we would have to be there at 0600 for check-in. Calling a second time on the day of departure they told us it was sufficient to be there at 1030 because the flight would ""probably not leave"" before 1400 anyway. Treated like kettle just as we had been in the departure hall of CDG on the day down we were held in various queues most in the scorching sun until the crew decided to let us on board a little after 14. Many people having waited since 6 that morning were getting hungry by this stage and this is when it turned out Air Mediterranee had not provisioned for sufficient food for the journey. For a trip lasting 8 hours including an un-announced fuel stop in Algeria we were served the following: one tin containing 150 ml of salad one tin containing 150 ml of apple puree a stale muffin and a glass of water or juice. No bread no coffee no hot meal no second meal. Despite the pitiful amounts of food several passengers still had business to do in the toilets. Unfortunately there was no water in the toilets which soon became a no-go zone so dreadful only thinking about still makes me sick today. Arriving in CDG around mid- night starving with all shops closed having missed my flight out of Paris and longing for a clean toilet I swore never to use Air Mediterranee again.",,,,,
Had booked for the wife and I to go to Luxor for the day booked in advance through Thomson holidays. I thought it would be Egyptair but getting onboard found out it was an Air Memphis MD-83. On entering the plane you could see how old it was old seats equipment etc. It stank of aviation fuel at the back which is where we were sitting. It was only a 30 minute flight to Luxor but I was so glad that is all it was. It was ok and they gave out little cartons of juice to take up the time.,,,,,
We booked a day trip to Luxor from Sharm and flew Air Memphis. Aircraft was an old MD83 which was tired looking inside and out but clean. Friendly cabin crew juice and a snack were served. Don't let appearances put you off.,,,,,
My mother and I flew from Sharm to Cairo return. I thought we would be boarding an Egyptair flight - unfortunately not. We boarded through the back of the plane as we walked to our seats another passenger sat down only to find a piece of metal had come apart from the seat. Most of the seats were held together with duct tape. Never again.,,,,,
Belgrade to Hurghada on a charter flight. Old plane non-existent leg space cold food and dated biscuits. Only good thing I can say about them is that the cabin crew were nice.,,,,,
"Totally agree with all of the comments below. We travelled from Sharm to Cairo and back again on a day trip booked through Thomas Cook. Cannot believe a company with such a good reputation would use this airline. We are not nervous travellers normally but I was convinced we would not make it back in one piece. My husband described it as ""a rollercoster on wings"". Really bad smell of fuel almost no safety demonstration broken seats the staff were arm-wresting each other on take-off (not very professional!) the plane was so old. The scariest experience of our lives.",,,,,
We've made a return flight Paris - Marsa Alam on an A320. I have to say that crew were all very kind playing with children smiling. It's quite rare to see warm food in a charter flight even though the food was forgettable. Seats seem to be refurbished. Mine during the first flight was broken and I was always on recline position even during take-off. Return flight an A320 with no sign on the tail the space for legs was a shame.,,,,,
We flew Air Memphis from Milan to Hurghada with our 4 month old son. The baby pushchair was broken while handled by airline staff and we are still waiting for an answer from Air Memphis who play dead. Apart from this behaviour food terrible staff unpleasant and unhelpful. No baby cot like any decent airline - even though we had been promised one - on a night flight meant that baby slept on our laps and we stayed awake.,,,,,
Luxor via Sharm to Manchester on A320 after Monarch refused to let me and my 8 year old daughter board with Kiss Flights tickets. There were 13 of us stranded at Luxor and about 70 more in Sharm so we only half filled the plane. The crew was friendly professional and sympathetic to the fact we had been delayed for a further 4 hours. Whilst the plane was obviously quite new the seats were refurb in my opinion but we had plenty of leg room a very pleasant but simple dinner - no alcohol on board - but drinks free with our meal unlike Monarch who only give coffee free. As soon as we had eaten and duty free had been up and down the lights were dimmed as it was very late. Air Memphis may be budget domestic flights but their international flight for me and my companions on board I thinks was excellent.,,,,,
My son and I flew Air Memphis from Hurghada to Cairo (and the return flight) in August 2010. Like most people I had expected an Egyptair plane and was surprised to see Air Memphis as I had never heard of them. I too noticed a pool of some liquid under the plane as we went up the steps to board but gave it little more thought. The flight up to Cairo was on a relatively new Airbus but it had the same problems of broken seats overhead lockers etc. The person sitting next to me was on her own and obviously a nervous flier at the best of times and she had kittens when the locker above her flew open mid flight! Other than that the flight was uneventful we were offered but politely refused the date biscuits and carton of drink as they looked like they had been offered round many times previously. The flight back was on an ageing MD83 I have never liked flying on planes where the engines are mounted at the back either side of the tail.,,,,,
I flew Air Memphis Luxor to Abu Simbel on a very ancient Romanian built BAC 111. Frightening on way out even worse when we landed back at Luxor - we were still deplaning onto a ferry bus when the pilot and engineer used a car jack to replace one of the front wheels that had a very bald tyre in front of all passengers. Never again.,,,,,
Sharm to Cairo day trip. After asking the tour operator who we would be flying with and being told Egypt Air we were not impressed when we found ourselves entering the tail of Air Memphis. I have to say I am not a nervous flier in the slightest but myself and my partner were genuinely fearing for our lives. The journey started off ok apart from the poor safety demo but landing was a different matter. Whilst looking out of the window at the scenery coming in to land I noticed planes and helicopters a good 100m to our right - and then a runway. This set alarm bells ringing but I just thought it must be a huge airport - however we were almost at the ground when we took off again! People were in tears and panicking all down the aircraft. We were in the air for another 40 minutes with the aircraft seeming to stall midair drop a bit then speed up on numerous occasions. Needless to say I did not want to get on the flight home that evening. We made it safely back to Sharm that night but I would highly recommend that nobody fly with Air Memphis - ever!,,,,,
I flew Air Memphis as part of a day tour to Abu Simbel from Aswan. Like many on this site I had assumed that I would be flying Egypt Air but was very surprised when I arrived at the airport with the tour group and saw the ancient DC9 on the tarmac. I'm a nervous flyer anyway and so really had to weight up how much I wanted to see the sites. I decided seeing as my tour manager does this every week and that he's still here that there must be an element of safety! The safety announcement lasted approx 30 secs and did not involve lifejacket demonstrations (you also fly over Lake Nasser not just desert). They omitted the safety demonstration on the flight back. People were using their mobiles throughout the flight and the cockpit door was propped open frequently. Security was a joke. Our boarding passes had random names on (no form of ID was ever seen nor asked for) and we were allowed any type of fluid with us they just didn't bother to check. Everyone beeped as they went through the walk through scanners and no one was patted down. The plane was in a poor state with many seats broken what appeared to be parcel tape holding things together and the constant smell of fuel. I would never choose to fly Air Memphis again and would recommend that people make their own arrangements to fly Egypt Air instead.,,,,,
Aswant to Abu Simbel. It's a good thing I have no fear of flying after a rough flight to Abu Simbel they landed and during taxi to the parking spot as they got there they locked the brakes tossing any loose things in the cabin towards the front of the plane. Judging by the laughter from the guides for different groups this is common. It was a DC9 that had seen better days and was suffering from lack of maintenance. On the return flight it felt as though they were rotating the entire crew attendants and all through the pilots seat as the flight would rock from one side to another quite often. After a short (thank goodness) flight back to Aswan they locked the right brake up on the taxi out to take off. You could smell the rubber from the tire. It was a rough flight. Apparently there is no safety organization for Egypt for airlines any other country (except maybe near Russia) would allow this to go on.,,,,,
Very similar to previous comments! We did the Sharm to Cairo day trip. Sharm to Cairo was OK (almost normal but a very old/cramped plane). But the return to Sharm in the evening was the first time I've ever really thought we were going to crash-lan. The plane was in a very steep final descent and turning left then right then left - right up until we hit (and bounced off again) the runway - and the cockpit door was wide open much of the flight. I would not recommend Air Memphis to anyone. (Boarding passes with random names on crazy/disorganised boarding process etc all applied to our return flight too!),,,,,
Aswan-Abu Simbel return as part of a pre-booked excursion. Had I known it was this airline I might have thought twice. Flew on a DC9 - I am 45 and sure this aircraft was older than me. It should be in a museum. Most of our tour party were quite relieved to make it back to Aswan - and that is about the most I could say about this flight - we made it back. Surprisingly staff quite good for a 30 minute flight each way. Not for the faint hearted.,,,,,
Sharm to Cairo plane looked tired scruffy seats dirty windows and cramped interior. However the flight to Cairo was pleasAnt with a good view of the pyramids and a good landing. After a wonderful day in Cairo we arrived back at the airport for our return flight and things now began to get interesting. After passing through security we were instructed to join a queue at check in where we were joined by a cat who ignored everybody and went to the front. As we waited an officIal walked down the queue and took our boarding passes to the check in desk on arriving at the desk ( we were last ) we were informed that only three seats remained but there were four passengers. After a few moments of anxious conversation it became clear we were in the queue for a flight to Luxor. Mistake reCtified we received our tickets for our flight to Sharm and discovered that our names were now Anton and Anna.The cat was by this time stretched out on the luggage conveyer belt. After waiting one and half hours we boarded our flight back to Sharm through the rear entrance of the plane with the engines running at what appeared to be more then idle speed. Cairo is a large airport at the taxi journey to the runway can be a protracted business (20mins) this was when a few doubts began to surface sudden large increases of thrust that some passengers thought we were about to take off. When the aircraft braked you could hear the brakes grinding take off was good and the fifty minute flight was fine until final approach to Sharm and changes in engine speeds that suggested there may have been a problem. However we landed safely and after taxing to stand I did think that the ground staff were a little tentative about approaching the aircraft throughout both journeys the crew were polite and professional same crew both ways.,,,,,
"My wife and I flew Sharm to Luxor on the DC9 -as the other comments say seats where broken the same crew that we had in the early morning still controlled the plane on the return flight late that night. I'm sure we all recall the somewhat vertically challenged stewardess handing out the date biscuits and fruit drinks. As we entered though the tail my wife pointed to the ""gaffer tape"" holding things together I noticed a large puddle of fluid under the body I convinced myself it was just water! However we got there and back on landing there was a deserved round of applause.",,,,,
We booked the Aswan-Abu Simbel excursion thinking we'd fly on an Egyptair aircraft but what we found at Aswan airport was an old DC9 of this previously unknown company called Air Memphis. The flight was ok but I wouldn't recommend the same experience to anybody. The airplane was old and smelly seats were broken no safety demonstration and fantasy names on our boarding cards. I'm an experienced flier but this was one of the worst experiences in my life don't do the same mistake and if you want to visit Abu Simbel (which is beautiful by the way) book an Egyptair flight or just forget about it.,,,,,
I agree with all other comments I've read! Flew Sharm to Luxor return last week and have never been so scared on take off or landing both ways. The MD83 was dirty dark and smelly and passenger comfort even on a short flight was non existent. On the return to Sharm we boarded the aircraft through the rear of the plane between the two engines which were/appeared to be slightly running. We had the same cabin crew as the morning flight 14 hours previously and they were virtually fainting from the heat. After sitting on the plane for nearly 20 mins before take off all passengers were incredibly hot to the point of wanting to disembark. The cabin crew did they're best with limited resources. We also received juice and fig roll biscuits both ways but one lucky local passenger was given a hot meal. A holiday rep in the seat in front of us was using his mobile phone during the flight and no one stopped him. The sound of what appeared to be wind rushing through the cabin during the flight did nothing to inspire confidence. I have never been so glad to get off of an aircraft. My advice would be to check with your tour operator before booking an excursion because I would never travel with this airline again.,,,,,
"Returned yesterday from a fantastic holiday along the Nile and Cairo. However this also included the experience of a lifetime - flying with Memphis Air twice. I am a seasoned air traveller but I have to say that flying with this airline did leave me genuinely frightened at several times during the flights to and from Aswan to Abu Simbel. The worst part was the return to Aswan where the pilot was continuously revving and throttling back the engines seemingly at random. Presumably he did have a reason but it felt as if he was battling with some problem. I decided to keep a check on the faces of the cabin crew and if they looked worried then that would be the time to panic! It genuinely was a scary flight on both occasions. Commenting afterwards a friend of mine described the trip as ""exciting"" which is one thing you do not want to hear during any flight!",,,,,
"  Do not book with this airline. Booked to go to Baku for the f1. They cancelled the flight with 4 days notice, offered no alternative. so was forced to book another flight at a much higher cost to get to Baku. Air Moldova know they cannot run their flight schedule, but sell tickets anyway. They then cancel with late notice, and do not offer any refunds. I have called, emailed, tweeted, FB messaged etc, no reply. This is a very simple scam, and very common, beware and do not use them.",,,,,
  Air Moldova cancelled my flight 3 days after taking money out of account. I found it really difficult to get anyone to engage with me and eventually they offered me a voucher to the ticket price. I refused this as I do not intend to use the airline ever again. they said there is a '€70 penalty' to take cash refund so I would only receive €6! ,,,,,
"  I tried to fly from Istanbul to Lisbon as I received a job offer. I had in hands: house contract, work contract signed from both parties, invitation letter from the company and even a document from the Portuguese Consulate authorizing my arrival. But yet, they have decided not to let me board with the excuse I need a visa. I am Brazilian, I don't need a visa anywhere in Europe, let alone Portugal. I've waited for about 4 hours until they decide to officially not let me board. The counter guy was absurdly unprofessional. The manager wasn't so bad. But then they tell me I need to contact an email or call some weird number that never picked up. And No one ever replied to my email attempts. I called the offices in Istanbul, Lisbon and Chisinau and none of them helped with anything. 230 euros on the trash. So trust me: they will coast you more than any other more expensive but trust able ticket.",,,,,
"  Don't buy a ticket with them, they cancelled my flight a week before my travel offering me to fly 4 days later. I asked for a refund and they told me that they would refund 27 euro out of 112 euro (wonder why only 27 euro), anyway they never refunded me anything. Sent them at least 50 emails, they never replied and tried to call them, same problem never answering the phone. I have been waiting 1h on the phone and no one never answered. Don't buy a ticket with them. No help at all and no customer service and the worst is that they will never refund you.",,,,,
"  
Prior to flight it was a struggle to book mobility assistance for my half blind mum. Eventually I booked it and received confirmation. No assistance was provided in Chisinau for her to catch connecting flight with only 40 min to do it. She struggled on her own. I will never book them again.",,,,,
"  Tel Aviv to Chisinau. They can cancel your flight any time, and if you will ask for a refund they will not accept. Try to avoid them, they only care for money. I had the worst experience with them, I waited at the airport 13 hours to take another flight instead. I will never ever fly will them again. ",,,,,
"  Very inflexible in giving me the dates I wanted to reschedule because of the Coronavirus pandemic, when I reschedule the dates I wanted to they gave me the dates I didn’t want to go, and I ask them for the dates I wanted and they said it was not possible for me to change the booking for those dates.",,,,,
"  Chisenau was our layover stop between London and Krasnodar and our plane with Air Moldova was delayed for a substantial amount of time, leaving us worried that we would miss our next flight. However, we were able to board our plane to Krasnodar, thanks to the staff at Air Moldova. Knowing that we, along with a couple of other passengers, were getting close to missing our next plane, the cabin staff ensured that we were the first to disembark the plane. Once at the Chisenau airport, staff took us directly to our next plane, which would have taken us much longer if the kind staff had not taken us via the quickest route. Without them, we would have definitely missed our flight.",,,,,
"  Chisinau to Paris. Awful customer service! Because the autofill on the pc had a mistake in my name and they told me that the correction is €90 that I understand but the lady got moody and said that there are no more seats. If i want to leave magically they will find an empty seat if i pay the full price ticket €250, and they gave me the same seat that i reserved at the beginning. I literally saw in my ticket after they printed it that they charged me for the name correction €90 and the charged me for an upgrade that I didn’t ask €160 - because otherwise they will not allow me to board.",,,,,
" Moscow Domodedovo to Chisinau. I've been using services of Air Moldova already for 3 years and I have a very positive impression. Airplanes are in good condition, come on time and the service is great. Especially, I would like to point out excellent work of online help service of Online Booking. I made a mistake choosing the date of flight and noticed it only after order has been placed. The operator gave me a fast reply to my email and was very friendly and helpful, so we could correct the date to the right one. So the problem was solved within minutes. Excellent work! Totally recommend to use this airline.",,,,,
"  Dublin to Istanbul via Chisinau. Horrible, lousy airline. Will never travel with them again. Massive delays and they cancelled my ticket that I had paid for and left me stranded in Istanbul. Still in it as I write this. Trying to get home.",,,,,
"  Chisinau to Frankfurt. I bought a ticket allowing hand luggage and a bag. I have been asked at the check-in to take out 700grams from my hand luggage (it was 8.7kg, exceeding 700grams) and for the my bag they said I have to change from backpack to purse. Crazy strange rules and horrible customer service. I took 700grams out of my hand carry in luggage and took put all my staff from my backpack and put them in my purse. Altogether it has to weight probably 2kg and this created lots of inconvenience. In all other countries I flew in or flew from, I have never had this kind of situations.The experience is definitely bad, especially the staff just repeating ""these are the company rules"". So for those travelling with Air Moldova from Chisinau be careful to not exceed the weight and have the right type of luggage. I would recommend to call them in advance prior to your flight and ask very specific questions. Otherwise you may have to leave luggage at airport especially if you are not living in Moldova or returning there. If I could, I would avoid flying with this company.",,,,,
"  Frankfurt to Chisinau. This airline is so abysmally bad that I can’t believe that it exists! I have a high tolerance for poor service and run-down planes, having flown in many third world countries, but Air Moldova takes the cake. Rude service - I was late in arriving at the gate thanks to a delay (not my fault) at Frankfurt security. The gate agent - apparently incensed that she had to hold the plane for me - literally started shouting at me when I approached and refused to even let me quickly pack my bags (which I had to grab of the belt at security without repacking In order to run to the gate) before I had to go down the stairs to the bus. When I say shouting, I mean it. She went beyond just poor customer service to literally hostile customer service as she was yelling “Boarding pass. Run down planes - The plane seats were torn and the plastic was actually yellowing. The plane was a 737-500 and thus had to be at least 20 years old. Poor safety measures - There was no safety card  in English. Forget that, it was not even in Romanian (the native language) or Russian. It was in Armenian. Why? Because they apparently leased the plane from an Armenian carrier and couldn’t even be bothered to swap out the safety cards. This strikes me as a major breach in safety protocol.",,,,,
"  Stansted to Chișinău. Pros: friendly and helpful staff, quick, easy check-in at airport, free hold baggage and generous cabin baggage, tasty & fresh complimentary food and wine on-board. All far better than I expected. Cons: plane was over an hour late - although the staff were very apologetic. I think their timetables simply aren't robust enough, don't have enough slack time, and airport turn-around not sufficiently efficient. Our flight was a late evening flight, and having looked at their flight history in general the earlier in the day the flight is, the more reliable it seems to be. It's also relatively expensive, but then there's not much competition on flights to Chișinău from London! Overall: This is a decent, professional airline that looks after you well. But it has some scheduling issues to sort out to improve punctuality.",,,,,
  Chisinau to Brussels. Bought an Economy Basic ticket for a family member but at the last minute had to suspend it due to emergency situation. It ended up being that we no longer needed ticket suspension and it was restored via emails with customer service. There was no extra charge and customer service representatives were very professional and prompt in their response. Thank you!,,,,,
"  Stansted to Chisinau. Rescheduled flight with no prior notice. Very poor ground team management. Flight was delayed on 12th of July from 14:40 to 21:10 without any notice provided prior my arrival to the Stansted airport on the day at 12:30pm. Was in contact with customer service on the 12th of July 1pm and was told ""my only option was wait"", which is very unprofessional as the overall waiting time is now over 6 hours! At this stage the airline has to offer refreshments and phone calls for every 2 hours of delay, in addition to a full refund that I am legally entitled to. Yet I am told my only option is wait!",,,,,
  Moskow to Florence via Chisinau. They changed twice the flight to my wife and just few days before the departure and in the airport of Chisinau they didn't provide the assistance due according to the regulations. Very badly organized company! It's very hard to communicate with them.,,,,,
" Paris to Chisinau. I have maybe flown 10 times with Air Moldova. I was surprised by the quality of service provided by such a small operator, and my trips with them have always been very pleasant. Lately, to avoid taxes, they decided to switch from Paris Charles De Gaulle to Paris Beauvais airport. At first, I was a bit disappointed, because it seems to me less easy to fly from Beauvais, but after few tries, I got to understand that there is no huge difference reaching Beauvais or Charles de Gaulle airports when you live far from Paris. I highly recommend Air Moldova.",,,,,
Air Moldova are hiding behind 'flight cancelled for safety reasons' to avoid delay compensation for a faulty engine leading to a 3 day delay which requires compensation to be paid under UK law. Despite numerous emails they remain silent on this matter.,,,,,
"I flew Air Moldova from Chisinau to Vienna. Flight left and landed on-time. Onboard service consisted of 2 large and tasty sandwiches, accompanied by drinks (including alcoholic, which are rare on some European airlines). The seats were comfortable, plane was clean and the cabin crew were kind and helpful. My ticket cost very little.",,,,,
"After a 3 day delay my replacement flight was still late departing and arriving. In flight meal was a sandwich cheese and salami, no options, a small alcoholic drink and good range of juices and tea/coffee. Seating was cramped - made worse than Ryanair as seats recline, it then depends on how considerate passengers are in front of you.",,,,,
I checked in quickly and was airside for my 08.20 departure on Saturday. The boards then showed a 70 min delay and some while after showed gate opening in 905mins and then 835mins. I found an Air Moldova staff member and was taken landside and explained to that the flight was tech and rescheduled for 21.30. Given meal vouchers and rooms at Radisson but at 15.00 told flight was cancelled. Recovered my bag by 16.30. I am now rebooked for Tuesday. Have to say staff were polite and helpful but in the dark and they were not pleased with late cancellation as rerouting customers late in the day via Heathrow was going to be a problem. Wait and see what Tuesday brings.,,,,,
"On June 9 2015 my wife and I were returning after a Business trip in Chisinau on flight 9U 895. We had purchased a direct flight from Chisinau to Barcelona. Once boarded we we were told that the flight was going to make a stopover in Lisbon. A surprise because at check in no one had informed us. The captain of the plane did not inform us and apologized over the intercom that the plane had to make a stopover in Lisbon. During the trip from Chisinau to Lisbon the crew gave us a sandwich for lunch and a drink. The stopover in Lisbon was nearly two hours, the crew did not give us anything to drink. On the way from Lisbon to Barcelona the crew did not give us anything to eat, and they did not have any still drinking water. We arrived in Barcelona with a 4 hour delay and we had to wait an hour to collect our bags. ",,,,,
I very recently flew from Frankfurt to Chisinau and I was once again extremely pleased with all aspects of the flight! My flight was operated by an Airbus A320 and was fully packed with passengers. The seats were very comfortable a warm breakfast was served excellent both in quantity and quality! The aircraft however lacked in-flight entertainment. Flight attendants seem to have significantly improved their command of the English language and are also very kind and helpful! The plane took off and landed on-time. The Captain of the flight kept us informed about flight conditions several times throughout the journey. Finally I would definitely recommend flying Air Moldova.,,,,,
Moscow - Chisinau - Rome and back. I chose Air Moldova because of the low price and very good connections. Unfortunately all flights were delayed (from 30 minutes to 2 hours) with no apparent explanation or apologies. The connection in Chisinau was about 1 hour 20 minutes both times but due to delays we had to practically run to get on the next plane. The Chisinau Airport was fine though much better for short transit that some of the other world airports. The airplanes are really old (I could see duct tape in several places) seats are very tightly packed and also falling apart - I could not recline my seat because the button fell inside the armrest. Inflight meal consisted of a cheese bun which was okay but not sufficient at all. I have to say that wine was served which was quite good and certainly a plus. Crew seemed surly and disinterested although this varied from flight to flight. The biggest problem is on the way back my luggage did not arrive to Moscow. Would I fly Air Moldova again? Maybe if the price is really low (it usually is) but I will keep everything in my cabin luggage.,,,,,
KIV-OTP on an old but presentable Em120. Flight was on time with good service (sandwich) for the short 1 hour flight. Steward was very friendly speaking good English. We were lucky that day only the flights with Em120 and Em190 were on time. Flights with A320 had 5 to 7 hours delays.,,,,,
STN-KIV-STN by Airbus 320. Flight was over two hours late leaving Stansted around 20 minutes late leaving Chisinau. Check in was fine. The really bad aspect of the flights was the lack of leg room. Absolutely awful. The inflight 'meal' was a cheese stuffed pastry. Not nice. Staff were fairly friendly but hadn't yet caught up with real customer service. If you over about 1.60 metres tall you will never walk again.,,,,,
FRA-KIV-OTP with Air Moldova. The first leg was operated by an Embraer 190 aircraft. Flight attendants were attentive throughout both flights. On the first leg the meal included a choice between chicken or beef which was fantastic. On the second flight a warm chocolate croissant was offered for the 45-minute hop. Second leg was an Embraer 120 aircraft which made the second leg of my trip entertaining. I was impressed by the quality of both flights will fly them again!,,,,,
KBP-KIV. The check-in at Air Moldova was very quick as there was no line. Baggage weight allowances were very strict since we were flying on a small 30 seater Embraer 120 Brasilia. Onboard we were offered complimentary drinks and croissants and even though the plane was small the seats were very reasonable. The flight was kind of shaky but it made the plane ride down to Chisinau very fun. We promptly received our baggage after clearing customs. In conclusion Air Moldova is a fantastic airline!,,,,,
LGW-KIV on Embraer 190. Departed on time and arrived a little early. FA's were polite and efficient. Catering was a sandwich and a choice of Hot drinks Soft drinks and Moldovan Wine. No IFE but not a problem on a 3hr flight. Only strange aspects were the very stocked duty free trolley coming through the plane but with absolutely no price lists or catalogues so I had no idea what they were selling and that the cockpit messages to staff were in Romanian which surprised me as most airlines now do them in English. Just one quick note be prepared to be locked in the airport for a while. My luggage actually came through first but when I cleared customs and headed for the exit I could see my friends waiting for me but the doors taking me landside were locked after much rattling around 10 mins later a staff member came and pressed the button to let us out! I would gladly fly with them again and the direct flight makes this the best option on this route.,,,,,
KIV-FRA-KIV. The plane was an Embraer 190 in spotless condition. Tasty hot meals both ways and a good selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Flights departed and landed on time. Connecting luggage arrived safely. Gate staff friendly and courteous. Onboard flight attendants looked a bit tired and could smile more.,,,,,
Was scheduled to fly IST-KIV on June 12. Learned 5 days before the flight that the service on that day was cancelled. Was offered a seat on the next day's flight transfer from/to airport and free hotel accommodation. A big thanks to the Air Moldova representative in Istanbul Sinan who was super helpful in arranging the details of my overnight stay in Istanbul. He accompanied me to the hotel met me at the airport the next day and was extremely friendly throughout my dealings with Air Moldova. Onboard the service consisted of a cold meal and a selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. FAs could learn to smile more. Plane a new spotless Embraer 190 with comfortable pitch and leather seats.,,,,,
VIE to KIV. The experience was quite odd like going back into the Soviet days as they were using a Yak-40 on the flight. Staff friendly and relatively professional although it felt almost like a charter flight. The meal was quite good and flight was on time. The cabin layout was really bizarre with something looking like a couch near the front of the plane and little leg room in my seat. The fact that they didn't de-ice the plane (it was snowing hard at takeoff) freaked me out a bit too. Not sure if they're still using the Yak-40 but if you happen to get on this one it's certainly a unique experience if you're up for it.,,,,,
OTP-KIV-IST return. OTP-KIV canceled due to fog instead put on the TK service to IST. For the IST-KIV on well maintained Embraer 190 with friendly and professional FAs. KIV-OTP delayed 1.5 hours but they kept passengers informed. Boarding was a bit chaotic as they could not figure which plane should depart first. They used a fairly old but clean A320-200 and staff were nice. For the price paid attentive service and helpful staff.,,,,,
Business class Moscow to Chisinau. I was the only business class passenger. Good condition A320. Flight was on time FA was smart pretty smiling and hospitable. Cabin service was fine - a full breakfast served and service was attentive. I was pleasantly surprised.,,,,,
OTP-KIV return on new Embraer 190. The flight was quick and the little snack was more than ok. Flight Attendants were only interested in some passengers and didn't really care at all for the others. I felt sort of unsafe as no particular attention was brought to passengers calling on cellphone or using electronic devices during take off and landing! My return trip was with the small Embraer 120 for KIV-OTP flight. This very old little plane of 30 seats only was comfy and I felt safe. The single cabin crew who was working was smiling kind and hospitality was great. We left and arrived on time.,,,,,
OTP-KIV Embraer 120 Economy Class. The airplane is old and uncomfortable. Whilst waiting in Bucharest had to approach the information desk and ask for explanations with regard to the late opening of the check-in counter. In fact with 20 minutes before scheduled departure the check-in hadn't opened. No announcements or apologies from the airline staff. Tarom-operated flights on this route are a better alternative. The only good thing about this flight was the responsive attitude of the FA on board. Otherwise Air Moldova needs to get its grip together if they want to retain customers.,,,,,
Flew Air Moldova on the Chisinau - London Stansted route. Check-in efficient and quick boarding. The Airbus 320 was in good condition and crew very welcoming. Once on-board offered a cold meal and one round of drinks. Air Moldova makes a technical stop in Paris to drop-off and pick-up passengers on this route. Given that total flight time to London including the stop in Paris is over 5 hours I think it does make sense to serve a hot meal and at least another round of drinks. I guess this was the only disappointment with Air Moldova.,,,,,
Route FRA-KIV-FRA. First flight was an unmarked MD operated by SkyWings. Service and food were average at best. Return flight turned into quite a nightmare mostly for passengers who had a connection flight from Frankfurt to another city. The flight was scheduled at 0805 first postponed to 0900 then to 1000 and finally to 1230. In the end our flight took off at 1340 nearly eight hours late. There was hardly a word of excuse except a roll and a bottle of water handed to each passenger in the departure area.,,,,,
FRA-KIV-FRA. This route is now run by an old MD-82 leased from Sky Wings (Greece). This plane has no markings and my seat had no tray table. Parking is at the furthest stand from the terminal so you will have a very long ride to/from Terminal 2. FRA-KIV meal was OK as was the service. KIV-FRA breakfast was great. No in-flight entertainment either way.,,,,,
I'd give it a solid average rating. It seems you can never get a uniform service though; sometimes you can buy a bottle of wine other times you are told wine is not sold or available or wine is served with the meal and sometimes there is none. The flight attendants are perfunctorily friendly something expected from a former communist mentality (customer service-wise). Air Moldova offers the cheapest airfare I have found and the only direct flight from Frankfurt.,,,,,
KIV-FRA-KIV. The airline currently uses A320-200 former Ansett Australia airplanes. Service was average. Food pretty simple and included sliced ham and cheese a bun and salad tea or coffee and dessert. Service average but the good part is the Moldovan red wine they serve on board! Flight attendants friendly but disappeared soon after the empty food trays were collected. Air Moldova is the only non-stop option between Chisinau and Frankurt and in terms of price much cheaper compared to other Air Moldova routes.,,,,,
I used to regularly fly Air Moldova and could see a huge improvement for the last years. The service on flights to Western Europe was always rather very good. Even if in the beginning nothing was different from a regular Aeroflot plane commodities (Tupolev 134) the air hostesses were very attentive and tried their best (speaking English as well as Russian and Romanian). Recently they got Airbus 320 and the flight is a real pleasure. Air Moldova has added lately their entertainment TV program in flight. That is also a change to the horrible comedy Russian shows they used to air before.,,,,,
 Absolutely useless airline. Cancelled tickets without notification due to aircraft maintenance. No refunds to speak of and promised to refund airfares but the refund has been postponed indefinitely. Lost money on this due to accommodation deposits lost. Do not ever use this airline! Use reputable airlines.,,,,,
  Johannesburg to Windhoek. They make abuse of the Coronavirus. Because we cannot go to Namibia at the moment we have to change the dates of our holiday. Air Namibia will charge the normal fee (45 usd per person!) to change the dates! Really unbelievable! KLM already did it for free!,,,,,
"  Johannesburg to Windhoek. We never got on the airplane. Air Namibia sold us the ticket after the gates were closed for boarding. We missed the flight and I've been trying to get our money back since August 2019. They admitted the were wrong, which I've got in writing. They then payed just over half the amount due, now saying we need to pay penalties. If the mistake was with the airline, as admitted, why are the passengers paying for it? It's R2000.00 in penalties. I will never fly with this airline again, as this is not our first bad experience with them. My parents have property in Namibia, so we fly there often. I will rather pay more and avoid this airline at all cost.",,,,,
"  Windhoek to Johannesburg. When checking in at 15H23 for our scheduled flight at 17H30, the assistant at the counter informed me that the flight is delayed. Couldn’t give a departure time, just that the flight from JHB hasn’t left JHB yet, due to a technical problem. And so our waiting of 5 hours 30 minutes started. And the staff wasn’t very informative or helpful. Lounge area disappointing! Plugs don’t work. Totally not up to standard. Our business class experience: seats 2d & 2c The leg/foot rests didn’t work. The food offered was revolting. The flight detail on the onscreen monitor was a joke. I took a photo to show people that we actually flew back in time! “current time 22:05, Estimated Arrival time 20:53”  We’ll never make use of this airline again and won’t recommend it to anyone.",,,,,
"  Windhoek to Frankfurt. After having read reviews I was prepared for bad service and problems during the flight, but luckily everything was fine and I am quite happy with the overall experience. The aircraft is spacious and clean, seats are comfortable and have a pillow and a blanket for each passenger. The crew was 50% very friendly and 50% not so (""good cop, bad cop""). The food was quite good; however, it might have been better, maybe a dessert could be added. Big selection of drinks but only one type of juice (orange). On the long overnight flight, dinner and breakfast have been offered. During the flight, the crew also offered water. The entertainment system is still not working; it seems to be a persistent problem that the airline is not willing to solve.",,,,,
" It was the first time I flew Air Namibia in June 19 in Business Class: thinking it was/would be a good and short flight from Cape Town via Windhoek to Frankfurt in business, but what I then experienced, was definitely not cool. Ok, the total cost/fare I paid was less than other comparable airlines at that point in time: but the fact that first of all my connection flight, from Cape Town to Windhoek, which was originally scheduled to only need about 1 hour for transit, was actually then cancelled. Hence I was advised - just a few days before departure then - to use a flight from Cape Town to Windhoek much earlier, leading to a like a 4 hour stopover on Windhoek. Not what I wanted, and also why I did not take another airline into consideration - then I could already have chosen Ethiopian or Turkish etc with a similar stopover time. Anyhow: so: the lounge in Windhoek is not a business lounge-like anywhere else in the world. It is so bad: no proper food, not adequate seats, no service - nothing, not even adequate toilets. Ok, the beer is ok - if that is what you need to survive. Now back to the plane: The service is more than just reasonable - nothing special - but for sure not business class standard. The seats are worn out - but I must admit flat seat at least. But that is basically all I can say positively. All the rest is not business class-related and feeling old. Food, just ok, hardly any selection of drinks and the worst thing: I do not know what really happened to my luggage: it arrived - ok - but in such bad condition. I hardly have ever seen before. So I must assume and believe that happened during the long transfer/transit in Windhoek as described above (as I travel a lot from and to Cape Town) but this trip definitely did wear out my luggage.",,,,,
"  We travelled on Air Namibia after our travel company arranged substitute flights to Victoria Falls due to our Virgin Atlantic plane being delayed from London resulting in us missing our connection. Virgin were very unhelpful offering a new flight 2 days later! The trip with Air Namibia was excellent from start to finish. The crew were very friendly on board, the food was nice. When we landed at Windhoek the ground staff were very helpful ensuring our bags continued the journey and we were kept informed.
",,,,,
"  This is the worst airline I have ever flown with and their customer service is even worse. Less than 24 hours before I was due to fly I received an email from them informing me that these time of my flight would be changing and would now be 3 hours later. This would mean that I would miss my connecting flight, which they were well away of. I spent the rest of the day trying to sort it out, even going to the Air Namibia offices in Windhoek but everyone I spoke to promised to call me back and never did. Eventually, less than 12 hours before my flight I got a reply to tell me they couldn't do anything. I had to spend a night in Johannesburg, booking into a hotel, at my own expense and arrived at my destination a day late. I have since written to Air Namibia on a number of occasions, and not received one reply. This company is appalling, apparently I have since heard that they have a reputation for this sort of thing.",,,,,
"  Cape Town to Windhoek. I am in total shock and horror. The communication channels for Air Namibia are incredibly inefficient. I have tried to call 8 numbers to try re-route a ticket, and there has been no connectivity or no answer from Cape Town offices, Johannesburg offices and even Namibia's offices (including head office).  This is unbelievably unacceptable? I was on hold at the call centre for 30 mins, ad the website's refund policies do not load. An empty box appears, making it very difficult for us to invest in a ticket change without certainty. I have never flown with Air Namibia before, but I have had countless flights in my life, and changed tickets and routes many times - and it has never proven to be so long, tedious and inefficient. Please could you work on making sure your communication channels are more efficient to ensure a seamless customer experience.",,,,,
" Cape Town to Windhoek. Overall it was a very pleasant flight experience. The staff at the check-in counter were very helpful to change us to our desired seats because we had to check-in at the webpage of another airline (codeshare). The seats were comfortable with an average seat-pitch. On board were three options of meal: Chicken, Beef and Fish. We had forgotten to order a vegetarian meal. But the staff prepared us a vegetarian mean from the sides of the other meals. In generall al staff of Air Namibia, with whom we were in contact were very friendly and helpful.",,,,,
" Windhoek to Frankfurt with Air Namibia. The ground staff were helpful to assign us the desired seats. The plane was quite new and provided a modern entertainment system (unfortunately with a smaller selection of movies compared to other airlines). The seats were comfortable with a usual seat pitch. The crew were friendly and helpful. During the flight were three choices of food offered (Chicken, Beef and Fish).",,,,,
"  Cape Town to Windhoek. Never fly with Air Namibia, flew back to Frankfurt via Windhoek on 17.02.2019 after a four-week holiday in Cape Town. The problem actually started when checking in in Cape Town. We have never experienced such unfriendly and unwilling groundworkers who refuse work. The highlight of the outrage was, however, that for my golf baggage that the approved dimensions exceeded by as much as 6cm, a transport fee of 2 322, - Rand (about € 150, -) was charged. The checking-in employee put on his tape measure until he really came to the 6 cm. Of course we did not agree and tried by all means to avoid this arbitrary charge. Unfortunately, we have come to the wrong address with the two colleagues. Neither Ziupad nor Sean (Supervisor) were in any way willing to compromise. They shone through ignorance and unimaginable stubbornness, combined with a rudeness that is second to none. Even my objection that the luggage on the way in Franfkfurt in any way appreciated and simply waved, the situation did not improve. After much discussion in the course of which I wanted to speak to the supervisor, they even did not shy away from letting the police come to the counter. We paid a total of € 4423.16 for the flight. And then this very nice holiday was completely messed up by this action. That was just the beginning of a flight full of mishaps. On the connecting flight to Frankfurt, I can only confirm what the travelers from France (N Ranelle) from 29.10.2018 had experienced before me. Very unfriendly crew. The two business class toilets were blocked for hours by the crew. Entertainment System failed in more than half of Business Class. No magazines. Seats only mediocre. Drink service during the night not available. The top, however, was the Business Lounge in Windhoek. Ripped sofas, makeshift louvered ceilings. Dirty carpeting, plastic cutlery and dishes. I have attached pictures. Unfortunately, I also have to say that the airline does not manage to keep any aircraft or building in order. Everything is used until it falls apart. In the future, we will fly to South Africa only Arab or Asian airlines, even if we will be traveling longer. For a stay of more than four weeks, this is not so significant and is more than offset by the friendly and perfect service, the modern airplanes and business lounges with smaller money.  Leider auch bei uns: Nie mehr mit Air Namibia fliegen, wir sind am 17.02.2019 nach einem vier-wöchigen Urlaub in Kapstadt zurück nach Frankfurt über Windhoek geflogen. Das Problem ging eigentlich schon beim Einchecken in Kapstadt los. So ein unfreundliches und unwilliges, arbeitsverweigerndes Bodenpersonal haben wir noch nicht erlebt. Der Höhepunkt der Unverschämtheiten war aber der, dass mir für mein Golfgepäck, dass die zugelassenen Maße um sage und schreibe 6cm übertraf, eine Beförderungsgebühr von 2.322,-- Rand (ca. € 150,--) in Rechnung gestellt wurde. Der eincheckende Mitarbeiter legte sein Maßband so oft an, bis er wirklich auf die 6 cm kam. Natürlich waren wir damit nicht einverstanden und versuchten mit allen Mitteln, diese willkürliche Gebühr zu vermeiden. Doch leider sind wir bei den beiden Kollegen an die falsche Adresse geraten. Weder Ziupad noch Sean (Supervisor) zeigten sich in irgendeiner Weise kompromißbereit. Sie glänzten durch Ignoranz und unvorstellbarer Sturheit, verbunden mit einer Unfreundlichkeit, die ihresgleichen sucht. Auch mein Einwand, dass das Gepäck auf dem Hinflug in Franfkfurt in keiner Weise gewürdigt und einfach durchgewinkt wurde, verbesserte die Situation nicht. Nach heftiger Diskussion in deren Verlauf ich dne Vorgesetzten sprechen wollte, scheuten sie sich sogar nicht, die Polizei zum Schalter kommen zu lassen. Wir haben für den Flug insgesamt € 4423,16 bezahlt.  Und dann wurde uns dieser sehr schöne Urlaub durch diese Aktion komplett versaut.  Das war nur der Anfang eines Fluges voller Pannen. Bei dem Anschlußflug nach Frankfurt kann ich nur bestätigen, was die Reisenden aus Frankreich (N Ranelle) vom 29.10.2018 vor mir erlebt hatten. Sehr unfreundliche Crew. Die beiden Business Class Toilietten wurden stundenlang von der Crew blockiert. Entertainment System bei mehr als der Hälfte der Business Class ausgefallen. Keine Zeitschriften. Sitze auch nur mittelmäßig. Getränkeservice während der Nacht nicht vorhanden. Die Spitze war allerdings die Business Lounge in Windhoek. Zerfetzte Sofas, notdürftig mit Decken kaschiert. Dreckiger Teppichboden, Plastik-Besteck und Geschirr. Ich habe Bilder beigefügt. Leider muß ich auch hier feststellen, dass es die Airline nicht schafft, weder Flugzeuge noch Gebäude in Stand zuhalten. Es wird alles so lange benutzt, bis es auseinander fällt. Wir werden in Zukunft nach Südafrika nur noch arabischen oder asiatischen Airlines fliegen, auch wenn wir dadurch länger unterwegs sein werden. Bei einem Aufenthalt von mehr als vier Wochen fällt dies aber nicht so ins Gewicht und wird durch den freundlichen und perfekten Service, die modernen Flugzeuge und Business Lounges bei kleinerem Geld mehr als wett gemacht.

"  We were traveling from Frankfurt to Windhoek in the business class. A night flight. Several screens were not working in the business class. Others could not been switched off. 4 air hostesses, 3 woman (the oldest one was friendly I have to say) and 1 man. Unbelievable behavior of the crew (never seen in any other company) in some way imperious, telling clients to do things, without any courtesy and politeness. No friendly responses to questions either. My daughter politely asked for a second bread roll and there were a prompt and harsh answer without any smile: ""no you have to wait that I have given one to everybody!"" It was embarrassing. I had the impression that she was angry about her work and everybody in business class. Not willing to do her job and not willing to make people feel comfortable. The man was also very unpolite, he stood in front of passengers with a plastic bag open (to collect blankets), just waiting that you put your blanket by yourself in this collecting bag which is not a problem, but no word, no ""please could you"" no ""thank you"" or something polite. It was highly unprofessional. They were all ungracious except the older lady. We arrived at around 7h00 at Windhoek. At around 12h00 we realized that we have had forgotten our computer in the overhead compartment. Aircraft was still in the airport. I called lost and found and a very bored lady said, the cleaner have given nothing to me and I cannot do anything. Later at the airport, ground staff also told me how can you proof that you have forgotten the computer there! Cleaner from the aircraft said that he had found nothing and that maybe the crew took the computer because they do first check to collect forgotten items. At the day of arrival, Air Namibia ground staff was not willing to do any effort or investigation to get the item back. The day after customer care contact told me maybe passengers took it. Just to make things clear: In the business class, the overhead compartment is quite personal. Two seats have their own large overhead compartement. We were sitting completely in front of the aircraft. While leaving the aircraft, no passenger were passing after us and even the computer could not have been seen by other passengers. The overhead compartments are placed very high in the Air Namibia aircraft, computer was not in a bag. Our overhead compartment looked empty, thats why we forgot the computer. We will never fly again with Air Namibia.",,,,,
  Frankfurt to Windhoek. Unfriendly crew and more than 50% of the entertainment systems not working. Air Namibia knows about the problem because there are reviews from moths ago describing the same problem. Obviously they do nothing against it.,,,,,
"  Windhoek to Jahannesburg. Excellent service, food excellent, great crew, comfortable seats and certainly a step above SAA. I travel 10 times a year to Namibia, and unfortunately I’m driven by frequent flyer programme loyalty, but as the said carrier continues to shrink its network, it’s going to be air Namibia for my future trips",,,,,
"  Paris to Windhoek via Frankfurt. We have flown Air Namibia a few times. Their inflight service and on-time arrivals were quite good. The way they handled connecting flights for us however was incompetent and the general customer service which was needed as a result, was incredibly poor. We booked our 13 year old son to Paris on Air Namibia. While the connection via Frankfurt (connection flight on Lufthansa) was o.k. on the way back Air Namibia booked him on an Air France flight from Paris to Frankfurt, with onward connection to Windhoek on Air Namibia. In Paris he was denied boarding on the grounds that Air France – unlike Lufthansa - has a minimum age requirement for alone travelling juniors of 14 years. (Lufthansa's minimum age is 12). Air France check-in staff said that he should have never been booked that way by Air Namibia as the age of the traveler is obviously known when the booking is made. When he was denied boarding we rushed to the Windhoek Airport asking Air Namibia staff for help and to re-book our son on LH connecting flight for the next day. We were surprised that while admitting their mistake they charged us for the re-booking (LH instead of AF) and said we should contact Customer Service for a refund. Apart from a holding reply after 2 days we have not heard back from them in more than 3 months. Reminders were ignored. Not only a very incompetent booking system but also a customer service which is non-existent. Sad for an airline which otherwise tries hard to compete. We might fly them again for any easy non-stop flights, but certainly not for any trip that requires a connecting flight.",,,,,
"  Frankfurt to Windhoek. I try to keep it short, to summarize our experience with Air Namibia, based on a booked holiday, originally starting 24th of October. Original Flight Frankfurt to Windhoek on 24th of October cancelled with short notice we had to rebook to fly a day earlier, leading to additional costs for room and expense - Taxi etc. Confirmed booking for seats was lost Asian Vegetarian food booking not fulfilled - 1 poor spare replacements for 2 guests evening food, Breakfast cancelled totally, as no vegetarian food available Flight Windhoek - Victoria Falls confirmed booking for seats was lost Flight Victoria Falls - Windhoek Plane broken - announcement of 2 hour delay Plane left Victoria Falls late by 4 hours late. Plane was not going back to Windhoek directly, as redirected to Harare to pick up waiting passenger and save flight costs from there, additional 2 hours flight time we had to leave the plane in Harare to redo the emigration and security process from scratch, nor did your crew have a clue that this will happen - additional 45 minutes of chaos and confusion. Crew had no clue what about the overall situation of passengers, neither their arrangements to be hit. Arrival Time Windhoek 23:30 - approx 6 hours late - Luckily we did not have a flight booked back to Frankfurt as 6 passengers this night, as that flight was missed. No possibility to pick up booked rental car, as all companies closed already. Additional costs for Taxi and delivery by rentals company next morning to hotel. Flight Windhoek- Frankfurt Confirmed booking for seats gone - new seats arranged by friendly ground crew, just to find out that the entertainment program for these seats were broken, as it was for other passengers on the flight 2 weeks before, so no wonder that theses seats were free. Poor quality control. As a summary, the ground staff and flight crews were friendly and helpful (mostly), the decisions made by called management are not just questionable, they will lead to damage for the name of the company. We will never fly Air Namibia again, better booking via South African Airways. 2 Stars for parts of the crews and groundstaff only. Not to mention, customer service post flight seems to ignore direct communication.",,,,,
"  I have 3 flights with Air Namibia in December. First Johannesburg to Walvis Bay, via Windhoek : First leg was cancelled. A few days later I get noticed that my sons ticket from Walvis Bay to Cape Town also was cancelled. Now I worry for my last Air Namibia ticket from Walvis Bay to Windhoek. Is something up or are they just cancelling 2 of 3 flights to and From Walvis Bay?",,,,,
"  First time with Air Namibia flying from Johannesburg to Windhoek. What a pleasant surprise. Excellent cabin crew, a complete meal served on a 1hr40 min flight, and on time. Henceforth I'll make Air Namibia my carrier of choice whenever I travel to Windhoek. Keep up the good work.",,,,,
"  Windhoek to Cape Town. The food was plenty, attendants were friendly and firm in their instruction. A delay in boarding at Windhoek and no announcement that that was what was happening. Jerking and shaking as the aircraft took off, when I asked one of the staff he said ""it was the wind, strong wind."" ",,,,,
"  I was happy with the four Air Namibia flights of this trip (Frankfurt-Windhoek, Windhoek-Cape Town and back). Plenty of food and drinks, only one minor delay, everyone was nice and the price was great. However, at Cape Town Airport the check-in for the flight back opened way too late. There wasn't enough time to pass all the necessary security check and passport control queues. When we had to ask for airport employee help at the passport control queue, they were rude and said it wasn't their problem, but the airline's. This caused delays at both Cape Town and Windhoek and we almost missed the connection. Frequent travellers said this was a common problem on Fridays, should have been addressed by now. Also, the website doesn't have a filter for visas required to enter the destination.

"  Durban to Windhoek via Gabarone. Various bad experiences on Air Namibia starting from purchasing the tickets. Such a rude agent in the office in Windhoek assisted me. After much unnecessary attitude and lack of willingness to help I got to purchase my tickets. The trip from Windhoek to Durban was absolutely fine, plane was late, but the trip was fine, however the trip back was a nightmare. We did a little holiday shopping and we knew one of our bags was going to be overweight, we asked to be checked in together, they said no, my bag was 20kgs, boyfriends bag was 28kgs. We said its fine we will pay the excess, they refused and said we had to take items out of our bags. We took our toiletries out, some boots and a heavy wrapped gift we received from the family we visited. Thereafter I had to wait until they could confirm if there was still a seat available for me on the plane. I finally got checked into the flight after almost 3 hours, we got to security and turns out heavy gift was a vintage bottle of alcohol in a vintage case, so we could not take it through. We had to then go buy a bag to place all items back in, and try to get the bag checked into luggage again. Back at check in counter we get informed that we now have to pay excess for this bag if we are to check it in. So suddenly they can allow excess payments but earlier in the morning when we originally wanted to pay the overweight charges we were refused. By some small miracle a lady at the counter assisted us and we could check the bag in at the 'Large parcels' desk. The flight was also about 30mins late, after which we all boarded but could not take off because there were 4 infants on the plane but the incompetent persons at check in did not check the passengers with infants into the correct seats, (seats with 3 oxygen masks) it was then another 20mins of begging people to switch seats with these mommies and babies. Be warned fellow frequent flyers, if you wish to ever reach your destinations on time Air Namibia is not the airline to fly with.",,,,,
  Cape Town to Walvis Bay a week ago. Most luggage left behind in CPT with excuse that more fuel was needed. Flew back from Walvis Bay to Cape Town and not one piece on luggage of all the passengers arrived. Same fuel story given. No one can once again advise on when our luggage will arrive. Air Namibia is takung us for fools. No compensation offered when we arrived in Walvis Bay and stayed without luggage till the following night. ,,,,,
"  Frankfurt to Windhoek operated by Air Namibia A330. In general the flight went well. The A330 is a modern aircraft and the cabin was modern and the seats comfortable. During this flight we had two meals which were good but no more. On this flight there is no wifi and the inflight entertainment was really bad - a little choice of films only available in two languages. For me the worst thing on this flight is the cabin staff. There are not pro-active and not friendly and helpful. We were forbidden to stay in the back galley and we had to return to sit as soon as we had finished drinking and eating. I don't recommend this airline for that, but all the rest of the flight was good.

",,,,,
"Frankfurt to Windhoek with Air Namibia. Overall a nice flight, friendliness of staff above average. Food / drinks above average. Selection from 3 different meals, quick service, drinks (also with alcohol) before and after the meals. Age of the aircrafts under 3 years - means almost new. Entertainment system with high-res 10"" adjustable screen and some new movies at every seat. Seat legroom average. Newspapers / magazines only for business class.",,,,,
"Lusaka to Cape Town via Windhoek. I booked this ticket on line, about 4 weeks before the departure date. I had to phone the Air Namibia call center after booking as I received a confirmation email but not the e-ticket. The night before the departure, around 20:00, I received a call from Air Namibia informing me the flight had been cancelled due to an operational issue (most likely not enough booked passengers) I was given the option of being re-booked on any of the daily flights on South African Airways to Johannesburg and then Air Namibia to Windhoek. I chose the 13:25 flight and was told to pop into their office at the airport to collect my new ticket as it would be waiting for me. Unfortunately it wasn't and it took three hours of sitting around and a final mad rush to board (ever walked onto a plane where everyone has been sitting waiting to see what idiot has held up the flight?) Anyway, to cut it short, a journey that should have been 4 hours (check in and flight time) ended up being 11 hours. Air Namibia, not a care in the world.",,,,,
"  On 8 September I flew to Windhoek. I departed Johannesburg on SW722 at 06h40 and was due to return on SW729 at 1735 the same day. The tickets cost me ZAR 4,854.94 in total. My meeting was very short, so I decided to return to Johannesburg earlier. I went online and changed the time of my flight to 14h55. At this time, there was no option to change anything other than the time since the website showed that all economy seats were sold out and that there were only two Business Class seats free. It cost me ZAR 1,230.95 to change the ticket. When I arrived at the airport, I went to collect my ticket and received my boarding pass without incident. My seat was now 11A. I got to the aircraft and found that I was now directed to an Economy Class Seat. I queried this with the cabin staff and they told me that I chose to pay R 1,230.95 and to convert my seat to economy. I asked how this was possible - they were unable to answer. They even checked my printed ticket that I still had with me and agreed that I had initially booked a Business Class ticket. I then also noticed that there were in fact about 8 open Business Class seats and about 20 open Economy Class seats! In the end, they crew was so adamant not to allow me the benefit of sitting in those ""special seats"" that they delayed the flight by over 20 minutes and made everyone wait. I made it clear several times that I will not delay other passengers over this and suggested that I be refunded and that I have my later Business Class ticket returned. The staff eventually asked me if I was ""offloading myself"" and told me that - if I get off, they could not guarantee that I would have the seat I paid for, on the later flight! In the end I was forced to sit in Seat 11A and told that I could fly home and that I could contact Air Namibia for a refund later. ",,,,,
"Frankfurt to Windhoek. I was surprised by Air Namibia. The airline offered a super service and you could watch many movies, the service of the cabin crew was great, the stewardesses have skilful English and German which helped. Generally a very good airline for the budget.
",,,,,
  Johannesburg to Windhoek. After one and a half hour delay no indication given of the actual time the flight will depart. No reason communicated to passengers. All consecutive plans made had to be rescheduled. Quite unprofessional considering the amount paid for this flight.,,,,,
"  Luanda to Cape Town via Windhoek. Connecting flight cancelled so we had to overnight in Windhoek. Total chaos at the check in the next morning with one queue for Luanda, one for Johannesburg and many for other destinations. Although we arrived well in time, the queue moved slowly and there were lots of people. Then the booking clerks start shouting out for passengers for Cape Town and many rush forward. Chaos ensues and because we are travelling with children we cannot move as fast as others. When we are served we are told we have been bumped from the flight (it was over booked). Passengers behind us in the original queue make the flight. We have to overnight a second night in Windhoek (where we still are). Air Namibia are totally disorganized and have no regard for children.",,,,,
"During this Air Namibia flight, I received exceptional service from a flight steward on SWO714 between Cape Town and Walvisbay on 7th December 2015. He went the extra mile to help out with a difficult situation. I noticed on the steps to the aeroplane that I had left one of my hand luggage items in the restaurant in the departure lounge. This was a tragedy for me because the item was a very large framed photograph (shown below) I had taken of my son-in-law, and was meant to be his Christmas present. The steward immediately offered to find out whether it could be retrieved but there was too little time left before take-off. Later on he gave me a cell phone number to enquire with assurance that something could be done. When I phoned that number the following morning, I had little hope of any success but to my surprise the steward himself answered the phone, told me that the picture had been found and will be kept safely until my return from Namibia on 27th December. I ask him if there was any chance of getting the photograph to Walvisbay, seeing that it is a special Christmas present? He said he will see what he can do and will let me know. That very afternoon, I could pick up the picture from the Walvisbay airport – what an incredible service.",,,,,
"Air Namibia flight from Cape Town to Windhoek in economy class. I lowered my expectation before flying with them but it was still a dull experience. Fortunately, it was only 2 hour flight. The FAs seemed really not interested in doing their jobs. Only good thing was they were not rude. The food was abysmal. I don't even remember what I had. The cleanliness of the plane was below average. Despite this, Namibia is a fascinating place, so don't let the airline discourage you to come.",,,,,
"In the last past years Air Namibia has improved a lot the service and it's a very affordable and worthy airline. I flew from Windhoek to Cape Town several times this year and the service was very good. Staff were friendly and food quite good as well drinks. Since 2013, Air Namibia has improved and I strongly recommend.",,,,,
"Flew Air Namibia from Johannesburg to Windhoek. The staff were very polite and accommodating, there was a large group of us and they were all very helpful and understanding. We were only on the plane for a few hours, but food was served fast and the boarding and unboarding of the plane was quick and painless. I would happily fly with Air Namibia again.",,,,,
"Air Namibia from Frankfurt to Windhoek return. Very good service, new A330 with good comfort and entertainment, 80cm between seats.",,,,,
Flew business class with my wife and 20 month old toddler to from Windhoek to Cape Town and back. Both flights left on time and boarding was pretty quick even though the flights were pretty full. Onboard service was extremely good. The flight attendants were very friendly and helped with the little one where they could and made the flights a very relaxing experience. They are using relatively new Airbus A319 which were clean and comfortable. Food was good but this usually is the case with Air Namibia on all their flights. No on board entertainment on the flight but for 1hr 50 minutes this was not a problem.,,,,,
"SW286 in economy in mid December 2014. I've taken this flight a number of times over the past 10 years this ranked as one of the better experiences by far. First and most important Air Namibia is now using a pair of relatively new leased Airbus 330-200s on this route. The difference between this and the old Airbus Boeing 747s and MD8s are striking. The passenger cabin is clean relatively modern and well lit. The seats have seat-back entertainment systems. I travel with an iPad pre-loaded with movies I want to watch so I can't speak to the entertainment menu itself. The food was relatively bland - simple but edible. They serve a ""breakfast"" close to landing but it's not up to much. Seat comfort - I was in 20H on the aisle adjacent to the bathrooms. Seat doesn't recline but there is no electrical box under the seat in front of you in row H. Flight departed FRA on time and arrived Windhoek 15 minutes early. The flight attendants were for the most part polite efficient and attentive without being fussy or cloying. This works fine for me but not for everyone. The flight is quite rigorously structured - drinks with a hot meal are served relatively soon after takeoff. The cabin lights are then turned off completely for the bulk of the flight (at least 6 hours). The cabin lights don't come back on until 2 hours before landing. All in all good value for the money and much more comfortable than I remember in the past. I remember this flight being more of an endurance ordeal than anything else I've flown SW286 on and off since 2000 and these new planes make all the difference.",,,,,
Windhoek-Cape Town return in May. The flying product of Air Namibia is very good indeed. New Airbus A319 with good seat comfort. Cheerful cabin crew and ok food. Inflight entertainment on the boring side but no problem for such a short flight. I did like it. What lets them down is the awful administration it takes ages to reach someone by phone and their so called call centre puts you on a loop whenever you are calling. So for me it was thumbs up for the flight and thumbs down for the admin.,,,,,
WDH-JNB. Flight departed on time food was good and service very professional. Seat comfort for a short-haul flight excellent! Boarding in Windhoek could be better. There was no priority counter. As with SAA passengers from Eco should not be allowed to use the toilet in Business class. The flight attendants should see to this.,,,,,
FRA-WDH (Windhoek)-WVB (Walvis Bay): First of all bear in mind that this in an airline that only operates 10 aircraft's in total (out of which only 2 are wide body) so just do not expect them to have the same kind of resources of competitors with much higher economics of scale. Brand new A330-200 (delivered 2013) serving Frankfurt - Windhoek route with relatively simple business seats (2 setting only meal/upright and lie flat) any other position in between could be adjusted by pressing continuously either one of these 2 functions. Leg part is for thigh support only as an extension for calf an ottoman is provided where shoes could be stored underneath. Simple and tidy without confusing buttons. Meals are served in very basic cutlery (on plastic tray) but the taste is surprisingly good (choices between meat/chicken and fish/seafood plus entree and dessert). Crew efficient and friendly without being pretentious. Luggage handling excellent with priority collection for business. Overall an Airline product that well represents Namibia: relax neat and tidy. Definitely recommended if your final destination is Namibia.,,,,,
Windhoek-Cape Town Business. Good boarding perfectly on time. New A 319 with extremely comfortable Business- seats (2-2 configuration new seats with plenty of rooms). Breakfast was good flight attendants very attentive and checking on the passengers. On time arrival. Can't get better than this flight and price was reasonable.,,,,,
Had a very pleasant experience on my flight from Frankfurt to Johannesburg via Windhoek on the new A330-200. Check-in swift and friendly staff. Boarding easy. Departed on time and arrived 30 min ahead of schedule in Windhoek with a 1 hour layover going to Johannesburg. The new A330 is very pleasant seats are very comfortable and was able to sleep for most of the time. Will be using Air Namibia on my future trips.,,,,,
FRA-WDH. Business Class. Separate check-in was efficient. Access to Cathy Pacific lounge. Flight took off on time landed on time. Three course meal + breakfast. Appetizer (smoked salmon) and desert (cheese plate) were good. Wine selection was solid. Main course was below average. Seats were circa 12 years ago. No AVOD but several channels to choose from. My video worked. My colleague in another row was not so lucky. When she brought this up our flight attendant mentioned how the staff was looking forward to the new A330s. Simple touches would have refined my overall view menu cards a little more attention to make up for the sub-par seats etc but overall it was a good flight.,,,,,
WDH-CPT. Business Class Flight departed on time/landed on time. Loads of leg room in both economy and business. I would argue too much leg room in business class (I'm short) but it was more than normal. Business class has in- seat video systems but was not available on shorter routes. Service went like this: welcome drink newspapers coffee/tea breakfast (food was very good). I went to the back cabin during the flight to stretch my legs it was “Economy Plus” seating throughout. At airport I did noticed the business class luggage came out last. Overall a good product new airplane.,,,,,
Frequent Flyer with Air Namibia part of their Rewards programme. Live in Cape Town but work in Namibia every 6 weeks for a week. Use to fly Economy but because of their old planes I moved over to Business. They have however moved to new planes which is fantastic. Still fly Business though. Leg room is great but don't like the harder leather seats (still need to be warn in). On-board attention is good enough (even in business). Its only a 2hr flight to Windhoek so there's only so much attention that I ask for. Only problem I have is the coffee on-board (Business Class). It really is disgusting. However all in all a great airline.,,,,,
Business Cabin was very old. It was impossible to sleep because of the old seat. The entertainment was not working. The wine was very bad I couldn't eat the food. Cabin stuff ignored the PAX (it was a better crew on the way back). FRA-WDH trip - not worth the money. I will avoid Air Namibia!,,,,,
Frankfurt to Windhoek and continuing onto Cape Town three days later - economy. Easy check in at Frankfurt and smooth boarding. Old plane but comfortable seating and pleasant food. No individual entertainment system - just the overhead screen. All staff very helpful and pleasant. Had special deal to upgrade on Windhoek to Cape Town flight for only $600 Namibian dollars. new plane with plenty of leg room and comfortable seat. Great service again. Pleasantly surprised all round and flights left on time arriving early in both cases. Recommended.,,,,,
My wife and I flew SW709 Windhoek - Cape Town on 3 June 2013 in Y/C. Brand new and spacious Airbus A319. Our flight can only be described as excellent! Extremely friendly and attentive crew full of fun and humour with passengers. Full service Dinner was a choice of 4 heated meals! Beef-Chicken-Fish or Vegetarian - very tasty. Flight attendants kept the wine freely flowing! Suggestions to their Cabin Services would be to change their brand of coffee (awful) and to issue disposable earphones to watch the in-flight drop-down movies instead of routing it through the PA system. All in all a great airline and a great crew flying the Spirit of Namibia.,,,,,
Service on board is not so bad but everyday you must fight with cancellations delays and unbelievable situations. Sometimes I fly domestically and generally they are not so bad but awful when I flew long haul WDH-FRA. In FRA after we checked baggage they announced the flight to WDH was delayed until the next day it was no possible to get your luggage back. SW paid hotel and dinner in a good hotel but airline service was very bad.,,,,,
I flew on 18/05/2013 from Cape Town to Windhoek and back on 26/05/2013. Was very surprised with the excellent service and overall great flying experience. The food was very good and although the tickets are a bit expensive for a 2 hour flight I still feel I got value for my money. The only thing Air Namibia should improve on is their in-flight entertainment.,,,,,
Flew Frankfurt to Windhoek on 1.11.12 and return on 11.11.12. Outward journey a little delayed due to mandatory inspection return journey on time. Big comfortable Airbus 340 food quite pleasant and flight attendants efficient if a little unsmiling. Entertainment not much good but no problem on a night flight.,,,,,
A319 WDH-JNB. Friendly cabin crew flying time just 1hr 35min yet a 4 course meal served with drinks and 3 choices of main course was served - however food of dubious quality with bland taste. Captain kept passengers informed about storms en route - all in all not a bad experience.,,,,,
I have flown this airline three times in the last three months. The flight was delayed every time. In total I have been in the air with this airline for six hours and delayed for 7 hours. Those who fly regularly from Windhoek know that this airline is unreliable. I do not recommend this airline to anyone who has connecting flights scheduled commitments or who do not have the mental stamina to endure wasted time or being treated with disregard. The ratings are deceiving because even though the general services are fair I would forego food and drink to been time.,,,,,
I flew from Victoria Falls to Windhoek and from Windhoek to Gaborone. Both flights were on ERJ135 planes. Actually it turned out to be the same plane and piloted by the same woman pilot. Both flights were on time and were only half-full. The single cabin crew served a small meal during the short 1.5 hour flights. All very relaxed and very adequate.,,,,,
Windhoek-Cape Town. Brand new 319. Excellent seats. Very friendly staff at check-in. Confusion at boarding when the sign at the gate showed wrong departure but all in all a great experience.,,,,,
Windhoek to Cape Town (just under 2 hours) and were quite surprised. Check-in was quick and efficient although the lounge at Windhoek is so-so (staff friendliness could be much better). Warmly welcomed onboard by the purser and were surprised to see business class seats with such a large pitch! Flight departed on time breakfast served was excellent and service throughout always with a smile.,,,,,
CPT-WHK and WHK-CPT. Brand new A319 with plenty of legroom. Comfortable seats and friendly FA's. Seats were comfortable and the cabin layout good.,,,,,
JNB-LUN. Flight left on time old plane but comfortable food was insipid flight attendants friendly but too much chatter amongst themselves. All in all an average flight. My problems started when I wanted to reschedule my return flight. Air Namibia office at Joburg airport could not help eventually had to purchase a return ticket on SAA to get back to Joburg in July and 5 months later I am still struggling to rebook my return to Joburg on the valid return leg I still hold with Air Namibia.,,,,,
I travel between CPT and WHK and haven't been on a single flight that's departed on time. The interior is old fashioned but quite comfortable and the FA's pleasant but without much effort at service. I will continue to fly Air Namibia between Cape Town and Windhoek.,,,,,
I fly with Air Namibia quite a lot and must say that usually I'm very happy with all. That's the reason I decided to comment here is yes sometimes there are delays but show me any airline that doesn't have that problem. Flew from Johannesburg-Windhoek. Flight wasn't that full and boarding went quickly and the flight left on time. Plane was an older B737-200 but looked in top condition and also the interior of the plane was really good. The on flight service was very good and I need to mention that the food served on Air Namibia is usually quite good compared to other mayor airlines. The plane doesn't have onboard entertainment but with a good monthly on flight magazine the 2 hrs flight is over in a breeze.,,,,,
Windhoek-Frankfurt-Windhoek. Service ok but FA's disappeared after dinner service. Even pressing the call button did nothing. Dinner was ok but the breakfast was embarrassing. A dry bun with a piece of ham and lettuce or tuna mayo and yoghurt. All around you saw people eating a few bites and leaving the rest. Seat was okay but IFE was a joke. For a 10 hour flight I would think you would have more of a choice than 1 movie played on 3 small screens in economy class. I sat in row 22 which was 4 rows from the screen and even by squinting I still could not see it clearly. Must be a nightmare for families travelling with smaller kids. I could have paid the same for a Lufthansa flight from J'burg with an additional R3000 for a return flight between Windhoek and J'Burg. Will do that next time.,,,,,
"Checking in at 06:00 in Cape Town along with my husband and 20 month old baby for our flight back to Whk at 0800 we were casually informed that our plane was ""inserviceble"" and would hopefully be ready for departure at 10:00. Needless to say that did not happen and we departed at 1800 that evening without much of an explanation or apology. My husband dared his next venture with Air Namibia on 21 March and was casually informed 5hours before his flight that it was cancelled but had been re-booked on a SAL flight to be booked in within 2 hours (which turned out not to be true after confirming the booking with SAL ourselves). We live 500km away from Whk and cannot be on standby to be ready for their flight changes as it suits them! We have always been regular travelers with Air Namibia but unfortunately it seems not to be safe anymore to rely on their ""unserviceable"" planes or their inconsiderate service.",,,,,
FRA-WDH-FRA business class. Found service ok but nothing special especially because these are night flights and FAs tend to disappear after meal service - nonchalant and indifferent service. Meal was acceptable portions relatively small but no effort to serve anything interesting or local flavors. Seat is old-style cradle seat but good room between rows and sufficient recline if you sleep sideways. Plane dates from the mid-90's but in OK shape. Be prepared to walk to/from terminal upon arrival and departure from Windhoek. Boarding in WDH is chaotic. Overall fares too high for the product/service they provide and would opt for BA instead via JNB.,,,,,
JNB-Windhoek - although plane not full it did seem cramped. Short flight but the crew worked to get round to everyone some of the crew friendly others less so. Main concern was on taking off several items within the cabin fell off - cover for an emergency exit 2 overhead storage cabins opened and the crew seemed to think this was normal and just refixed the items and carried on. Food was good though and seemed very cheap compared to SAA.,,,,,
FRA-WDH-JHB return. The main reason for choosing Air Namibia was their low price and (for us) convenient flight dates. Online check in worked pretty good and we could choose our seat for the intercontinental flights. Planes were in good condition seats a bit old and not too comfortable. Entertainment was pretty bad just a few screens for all passengers with horrible quality and uninteresting videos. Cabin crew was okay some of them more friendly and helpful than others. Same with the food nothing special but nothing wrong with it either. Overall my experience was quite good. You get what you pay for they don't excel at anything but nothing is very bad either.,,,,,
FRA-WDH. Service is not great they are just doing their job that's it. The seats are of the old angle lie type still in good condition but nowhere near to the newest generation. The video system is a shame as not on demand and very limited choice. They started the movie before the meal was served my screen was out of order. I mentioned it but they could not or did not try anything to fix it.We chose Air Namibia only because of the direct flight. If you do not mind having connections fly with South African.,,,,,
Air Namibia canceled our fight from Johannesburg to Accra on 1/24/2010 but the agents at Johannesburg didn't show sympathy or apology towards passages who were turned away. With a toddler our family had stayed at the airport most of the day to catch the flight home however the agents didn't issue any overnight stay voucher or arrange a transportation for everyone until 10 pm. The next day when we were switched to another carrier our child whom we had purchased a full-fare Air Namibia ticket didn't get a ticket for the switch. I had to march into Air Namibia office and request it. It was way too much for us who will avoid Air Namibia as much as possible.,,,,,
CPT-WVB-WDH-FRA Business class. Check-In at CPT was a total chaos. Air Namibia ground handling agents didn't bother to put airline logo destination etc on the screens above the counters - we had to ask if they had a dedicated Business Class check-in-counter and which one it was. Queuing up there didn't save us plenty of time though since they worked almost in slow- motion. Aircraft on Cape Town-Windhoek flight was a B737-200 built in the early 70s but in relatively good condition. Huge old-fashioned business class seats. Service very friendly and attentive - for Air Namibia standards even excellent. Our flight to Windhoek wasn't nonstop but landed in the beautiful desert airport of Walvisbay where they let some passengers get off and others get on the plane for the last remaining 30 minutes of the flight to Windhoek. This stopover lasted no longer than 25 mins. We had left Cape town with half an hour delay but managed to arrive in Windhoek only 15 minutes behind schedule. Lounge in Windhoek is small packed with passengers waiting for the Frankfurt flight. WDH-FRA their last remaining intercontinental route is flown with A340-300 (bought from Lufthansa). Business class is comparable to LH or BA of 15 years ago. Old style cradle seats no lie-flats. IFE in armrest as personal TV but only a small selection of movies. Food edible (dinner had 3 main course options breakfast either hot omelette or cold cuts) wines were delicious. Toilets clean small amenity kit was provided. I had 3-4 hours sleep. Their business class can't compare with major airlines but Air Namibia does the job. Their prices are reasonable.,,,,,
"Frankfurt-Windhoek-Cape Town return. The flights were on time and check-in boarding etc. was professional. The price was reasonable compared to other airlines at time of booking. First impression well maintained A340-300 exterior wise with a slightly run down cabin interior. Old and uncomfortable seats good leg room. A340 only had ""old fashioned"" television sets above the middle section of the cabin. One projector screen at the front of the cabin section and 2 television sets for the rest of the cabin. One criticism of the IFE is that the main feature starts well in to the flight when most people would like to sleep. The meals were average to poor there were no heated rolls and main course did not taste of anything. Cold breakfast only. Their bar service closed after the duty free service ""due to customs regulations"" something which sounds like a cover for cost cutting. They could have at least offered drinks for sale. This was though not the worst issue with Air Namibia. I would say their flight attendants have a long way to go if they would like to compare themselves to professional airlines. The flight attendants FRA-WDH were grumpy to the point where I would say downright rude. They did not attend to passenger needs in any ways and seemed to want to get over and done with the job. I was personally accused of credit card fraud when I purchased duty free products on-board as my signature apparently did not correspond. (I understand the problem of fraud on many African flights but she had my passport and a credit card with a picture of me in her hand. What else do Air Namibia need?) The way she expressed this was also very accusing. The crew never smiled once and we just felt we were in the way for them. The other three flights were slightly better but I wouldn´t go as far as to say they have attended a smiling or service course. I would say fly Air Namibia only if you´re actually going to Windhoek and want to fly direct or their offer is really good compared to the alternatives. I will gladly pay more for another airline next time.",,,,,
I had booked a return trip from LGW to WHK - about 2 weeks before my scheduled departure from Gatwick I stumbled across information (by chance!) on the internet that Air Namibia had axed all its flights from Gatwick. They never informed me of it at all (later I found out it was because I had booked directly with the airline on its website rather than with a travel agent. People who booked directly with the airline received no information apparently). So I phoned their representatives (who were still active in London). The agent who took my call was very helpful though - she rescheduled my flight without issues with BA via Frankfurt. She had also assured me that I could check my bags straight through from Heathrow to Windhoek. Of course this ended up not being the case. The lady at the BA counter at Heathrow knew of no such cooperation with Air Namibia. She said I had to re-check the bags in at Frankfurt. I didn't mind though. Otherwise my flights were on time and I got to Windhoek without any other hassle. The return journey was flawless - bags checked through all the way to Heathrow from Windhoek via Frankfurt. I would fly them again.,,,,,
"The flight from Cape Town South Africa to Windhoek Namibia in itself was pleasant. What was shocking was the bad service delivered at Cape Town airport when attempting to buy a ticket. I arrived at the airport to find that the Air Namibia office was closed within were the staff busy sorting things out. There was no sign indicating their hours so after having looked through the window I sat down on a bench outside the office. I must have sat there for about 15 minutes before some rude employee (I think she was the manager) opened the window and looked at me. Seeing as though she opened the window and was looking at me I proceeded to stand in front of her. She asked me very rudely ""What? Is there an emergency or something? It is our lunch break and you are bothering me."" I was well prepared to sit and wait for who knows how long as there was no sign indicating that they were indeed on a lunch break. I wanted to tell her to stick her ticket but it was the best one at the time. I have never experienced such bad service in my life.",,,,,
"WDH-FRA with my wife. Big mess to reconfirm the flights in WDH (computer breakdown) incompetent employees not willing to help. Checkin OK and quick very lousy lounge at WDH no priority boarding chaotic ""rush"" to the aircraft. Aircraft standing there the whole day and no traffic but able to depart 30 mins late. Worst cabin service ever experienced no meal choice available slow and incompetent staff. My wife went to the galley to ask gently for something to drink together with the meal the chief FA came to our seats and scold us ""you have to be patient we have other things to do"". Were treated like disobedient pupils no need to say after meal there was no more service and entertainment system at my seat was defective. Rude wake-up in the middle of the night 2.5 hours before landing for what they call a breakfast. Incredible and a great pity for the wonderful and friendly country of Namibia next time we fly again SAA despite of having to fly via JNB. We traveled last time in 2006 with Air Namibia and things have turned from good average to lousy.",,,,,
WDH-CPT. They offer more than european airlines on a 2 hrs Flight. Aperitif Service hot meal coffee tea etc. Very professional staff good information from cabin and flightdeck. Absolutely friendly.,,,,,
The nightmare of travelling with Air Namibia for our once-in-a-lifetime trip to Africa really overshadowed our holiday. They changed our return flight details approximately 7 times and our much planned for 10 hour direct flight from Windhoek to London (because I'm 6 months pregnant) turned into a 36 hour ordeal with no customer service to speak of certainly no apologies no alternatives offered not a care in the world from any representative we spoke to. And we certainly weren't the only ones affected. Not only had they dropped all their direct flights from London (which we had been informed of 3 weeks prior to departure) Air Namibia had also conveniently 'forgotten' their annual servicing so an entire week's worth of flights were 'rescheduled' (a kind description) which we first found out half an hour before leaving our house for the airport. Which meant our 10 days in beautiful Namibia were marred by trying to communicate with Air Namibia regarding our return flights. The whole thing was a disaster and when we finally got our BA flight home from Frankfurt the check in staff commented that this was all too usual with Air Namibia who were a well known nightmare to deal with and with whom they had no wish whatsoever to be associated. I heard since that people in the know will travel to Namibia via South Africa so as to avoid Air Namibia and use another airline. That travel tip I endorse!,,,,,
Cape Town to Walvis Bay [Namibia] return in business class B737-500. This was flying as it used to be good service hot meal on a 2 hour flight and large comfortable seats. Admittedly the outbound trip was 2 hours delayed and communication was poor but this is Africa and they did their utmost to turn it around when it did arrive. No doubt my holiday spirit affected my reaction to this if you had commitments it would have been a problem. I would use them again and would do the LGW to Namibia route with them. Safe professional and customer focussed.,,,,,
LGW-WDH return Business Class. Small busy lounge at Gatwick (multi-airline) much smaller and even busier lounge Windhoek (multi-airline). Seating 2x2x2 with PTV monitors but with which two attendants seemed unfamiliar - so wasted time fiddling and missed the beginning of the set. Food so/so both flights with alcohol ceasing to be served immediately after main food service. Economy passengers repeatedly used Business Class lavatories and attendants were unconcerned that we were waiting in line something I pay an extra amount to avoid! E- mailed Air Namibia upon my return. It took three months to respond despite my repeated reminders. Received seven paragraphs about the horrors of blood alcohol content and unruly drunk passengers. Such a patronising attitude towards experienced worldwide travellers will achieve no awards. I think Air Namibia is just plain mean with every aspect of its service.,,,,,
LHR - WDH and back during Nov 2008. Much better than expected. The food was very good and cabin crew were friendly & attentive. Plenty of water offered. My only gripe was the seat was very uncomfortable - OK once I fixed up extra cushioning for my lower back.,,,,,
WDH-CPT in Economy. B737-500 of unknown provenance but inside OK. The crew were pleasant and efficient the captain informative and a hot meal which was edible and fine. Timekeeping spot on too so a high mark. I have not experienced their single long-haul A-340 and its service but short-haul  perfectly OK.,,,,,
Air Namibia Jo-burg to Windhoek return. Both were excellent flights on time and with service from very good cabin crew - including meals that we used to expect but now no longer receive from major airlines including BA and Iberia. No hesitation in thanking Air Namibia commending them for the flights or recommending them to others.,,,,,
LGW to Windhoek return. Flight on time outbound and return with efficient boarding at LGW although free for all at Windhoek; however crew curt to the point of being rude except for one female cabin attendant on return leg. Food barely edible especially going out. Seats have plenty of leg room but are uncomfortable as the lumber bars do not work. Some problems with the heating - cold going out and excessively hot on return. IFE very basic largely with third rate films. Business lounge in Windhoek too small as a number of largish flights to CPT and JNB all going at at same time as LGW flight. I appreciate that Air Namibia is a cheap option and a direct route from London but would think twice before using them again.,,,,,
Frankfurt to Windhoek return Economy. Check in no problem. Flights on time. Seats ok. Food reasonable. Outward leg was the first time I have ever been cold at the back of an Airbus. In flight service disappointing. Crew did the minimum they could get away with. On occasions were actually rude. Uncaring and ignored requests for assistance. Main screen entertainment only with non functioning headphones. I do not recommend air Namibia but they have little competition to push standards up. German 'um pah' music during boarding and disembarking amused the Germans as well as the Brits!,,,,,
Just got back from a fantastic trip to Namibia but Air Namibia provided a disappointing end to the trip. They cunningly changed the time of the flight bringing it forward by an hour and a half so instead of getting to the airport almost 3 hours before departure it turned out to be leaving in an hour! Clearly no-one else had been told either as the queue was out the door - and to cap it all they only had one check-in desk open - I couldn't believe it! We eventually checked in about 2 minutes before it was due to take off and eventually left almost an hour late. A real shambles and what annoys me is that they clearly have all my contact details and could have contacted me via email or mobile to inform of the changes - I guess that would be too much to ask. I have traveled around the world and never re-confirmed a flight but would strongly recommend that you do with Air Namibia - it seems that the airline can't match the service and customer experience that the rest of Namibia offers.,,,,,
"WDH-CPT. The plane seemed to be an old Air France 737 as I noticed ""Air France"" on the seat belts and ""Sortie"" for exit. Although an old aircraft it was clean and the crew were professional. I also quite enjoyed the hot meal that was served. Much better than I expected!",,,,,
" I flew Tauranga/Auckland/LAX return, on NZ6 & NZ3 in Business Class recently. Overall a very good experience and more so due to the great staff the company has on its team. The Tauranga lounge is great, nice and quiet, nice outlook and good food and drink selection. Not so good at the Auckland International lounge, always seems crowded now and as long as you like Curry you’ll like the food. I retreated to my normal spot right down the back with a view of the runway. If there’s one area Air New Zealand can't seem to get right (in NZ that is) it is the boarding procedure. They don’t stagger it properly and hence it’s a stampede with everyone on the flight seemingly claiming to be a Koru Club member and it’s just chaos. Excellent flight across to the US, superb staff, great food, good alcohol and a lovely bed, hence nearly 8 hours of good sleep. They had run out of my first choice for dinner, I wanted the Rib Eye Steak. Nothing else appealed so they made me up a dinner to die for (Free Range chicken) which more than compensated for the unavailability of my first choice. The return flight was equally as enjoyable. Boarding at LAX was a breeze as it was done properly, it was staggered and I wasn’t trampled to death in any stampede. Meals were great (lamb that was so tender), top quality alcohol and the best crew ever and a special shout out to Mel who had everyone’s names memorized right from the start and she worked tirelessly the whole flight. Well done Air New Zealand..",,,,,
"  This flight is 17 hour long and the seats in economy are not suitable for this long journey. There is no foot rest which was so surprising and very uncomfortable for this long flight. Even in our US domestic flights we have foot rest. Space between seats are tight. Passenger sitting next to you is almost touching and no way to put your arms on arm rest without touching. And most unfortunate is their food. In such long flight they only offer one meal and a small breakfast not to mention both of them taste bad. There were no snack where other airlines offer snacks in between meals in their 14 hour flights. We are frequent international traveler and flown so many different airlines, so we can compare easily. Will never travel with them when I go to Australia again.",,,,,
"  All ANZ flights on this trip were late. This one in particular (NZ8) was delayed for an hour with no announcements, no explanation, no plan for customers who would miss connecting flights. Unacceptable. Skycouch is a nice product but super expensive at $1000 each way when occupied by one person. It works well for 2 children or an adult with 1 child but is too small for 2 adults. Food and what service there is, is the same as the rest of economy. The wifi, while free, did not work.",,,,,
"Best things about Air N.Z. premium economy: 2 check-in bags, excellent food, attentative and professional service. However my seat (in front row) felt cramped due to arm-rest having a traytable. The leather seats & interior felt dated and worn. Bizarrely the air-con was so warm/stuffy. The pilots were outstanding though.",,,,,
  Air NZ has changed my flights for a return trip Sydney to Wellington. I now need to take 1.5 additional days off work. When I called AirNZ to ask if I could have some small compensation in the form of lounge passes the Air NZ staff member told me that Air NZ could do whatever it wanted to because of the small print in its contract. Very poor service.,,,,,
" Seats very cramped except for our original flight to Auckland where we had bulkhead seats; food and food service satisfactory; but we had an outstanding cabin service director. Excellent with passengers and very good at his job...best we have seen. Fight NZ 6 from Auckland to LAX on June 5, 2023.",,,,,
 Their customer service team is terrible. They canceled my flight due to covid and credited my account. I went to rebook today and they said the credit expired (even though their website says I have the rest of the year until my credit expires). The lady I was talking to put me on hold for an hour and then hung up! Still trying to get it sorted but would not recommend this airline. Potentially thousands of dollars down the drain. I have spoken to several of their customer service team in the past and most of them don't know what they are doing.,,,,,
"  The worst airline I have flown with. First, they now require a “transit visa” which wasn’t on any of the ticketing or website including the app. Over 50% of the flight did not have this and they had QR codes at ticketing stating we needed to download another app and purchase this Visa in order to board. Only one of the 4 flights for our trip were on time. And when delaying several hours, they were unhelpful and one attendant actually rude. They were other flights available heading in our general direction, and instead of allowing us to change flights, they said we could book a new ticket but would not be refunded or credited any part of our flight since it was only delayed and not canceled - in no way caring that we were now losing our connection and going to be stuck another night in a transfer airport. I  asked if there were upgraded seats available to try and get off the plane faster since we only had 40 minutes to clear customs and catch our next flight- and she informed me they cannot prioritize anyone as they have 150 connections.  Also the food is horrible. The apple juice on the flight was delicious and their uniforms are nice. Also appreciated their acknowledgment of the indigenous peoples of the land. Will not fly again and do not recommend. ",,,,,
 Not Verified ,,,,,
"  The flight over was great, we ate breakfast then lunch. On the flight back we had one meal dinner which was good however we arrived at 6:15am and were not given breakfast or even a cup of coffee or tea. It was not a great experience having flown through the night. On top of this our flight to Perth arrival time was changed several times and we arrived too late to collect our rental car and lost a night's accommodation in Geraldton. To top it all off at Auckland airport the delay getting through bio security was a ridiculous 2 hours for us and 3 hours for our friends. It was chaos - hot, only 5 desks had people on them in spite of 2 planes arriving shortly after each other. Do not rely on the entertainment - the films were old and did not change between flights there and back.",,,,,
" My wife and I were booked on flight NZ580 today at 10.00am. We did the online check-in the day before and waited at CHC airport today, printed out baggage tags and boarding passes. Then when we put the suitcases on the drop of belt, my suitcase was accepted without any problem, after a short passport check by a staff member and disappeared. My wife's suitcases were rejected and the staff member was at a loss. So we had to wait 15 minutes for a supervisor to explain that our flight was cancelled and we were now flying NZ538. I then had to walk all over the airport to get my suitcase back. After 20 minutes, that was also done. Then we had to print out tags and boarding passes again and go to the drop off belt again. In addition, my wife would now not be seated next to me, but somewhere else on the plane. At 8:05 a.m. I received a text message telling me that the flight had been cancelled. I have rarely experienced such an unprofessional airline, where the customer is only informed about the cancellation of his flight after handing in his bag and the staff knew nothing about it anyway. Of course, there was no apology, just an ""engineering problem"".",,,,,
"  Thank goodness I never need to fly Air NZ again! Absolutely no sense of urgency, both international flights were over 30 mins late. The first flight was so late we missed our connection. Pilots and attendants do not communicate the reason we sit and sit and sit at the gate. Kiwi people may be laid back but this is not a good quality in an airline! If you have connecting flights you are toast! Do not recommend! Sitting so long at the gate I have time to write this!!",,,,,
"  I made an emergency trip and needed to book quickly and ended up with a complaint from this booking which I lodged on 17th of Feb. It is now 26th of April, and the only response I have recieved is an automatic one asking if my complaint has been resolved. I have sent 2 further emails asking for my complaint to be acknowledged. Air New Zealand does not care about it's customers and this is obvious.",,,,,
"  Very bad experience, flights delayed by more than 3 hours after going through customs. Not good traveling with a 6 year old either. Only got a 15 dollar voucher. Water cost 3 dollars in the airport. One of the worse flights. Maybe next time don't use air NZ",,,,,
"  Auckland to Melbourne flight on 21 April and encountered several new challenges. Firstly, the economy class seats are quite cramped and lack the option to recline. The headrest cushion pushes your head forward, leaving you in an uncomfortable upright position, with the screen poorly positioned for viewing or resting. The new seats lack low back support and are pretty uncomfortable. There is minimal space under the seat in front of you for a small laptop bag, and the seats above row 28 ABC were reserved for ""life craft."" A cabin staff informed me that I could only store one bag in the overhead compartment and the other under the seat in front of me. The Works package offers the option to request additional food and drink. I used to be proud of and recommend the high quality, standards and service of Air New Zealand. I don't think I can do this anymore and will reconsider my flying options with this airline.",,,,,
"  I like Air NZ, they never disappoint me, The aircraft was new Boeing 787, good inflight entertainment and service. The flight departed on time, and their app is awesome, they would constantly remind me of the incoming flight.",,,,,
"  Air New Zealand would have to be the worst airline I have ever dealt with. Due to COVID our flights were cancelled and then and provided a credit, we were asked to reschedule to which we did only to find out we had to pay an additional $220.00 plus each for the rebooking, I don't believe we should have had to pay the additional fees as COVID was out of our control. I now am unable to fly as planned and have called to see if I can obtain a credit for my flight, and have been advised by one-person last week I could change the name on the ticket or receive a further credit. Today I have been advised I am not able to receive a further credit as the ticket was already a credit and if they were to provide me with a credit I would have to pay for the credit and then also for the rebooking fee and whatever other fees they want to add to the next booking. Seriously New Zealand Airlines just lining their own pockets at the expense of their clients. I have to say their customer service team have been quite abrupt to say the least in the way they speak with their customers. Would never ever attempt to fly with this carrier again.",,,,,
"  First time flew with Air New Zealand on international route, not a great experience at all. Firstly we got tiny earplugs on 12 hours long flight on our way to LA. Couldn't fit at all . when asked for the head phones, we were told that they were for premium economy, which was very surprising as we have been travelled with different airlines too but never had to face this thing before. Secondly, I requested for vegetarian meal and to my surprise, half of the container was broken and had a big hole in it with food all exposed and I was served the food in the same condition by staff. When I notified staff about it, there was no other vegetarian food left on board. The flight was late both ways. We travelled with our 1 year old baby and other child with this flight. But we still have to wait in long queues with others waiting to board. Whereas other airlines show more courtesy to the families with young kids and ask them to board first. That was very disappointing as being national airline but not up to the mark.",,,,,
  An item was left in the seat pocket after the plane arrived at SFO. The Air New Zealand (lost and found) employee located it and quickly assisted us. She was efficient and went above and beyond to help us. We were extremely worried about getting it back. Thank you to the Lost and Found Department!,,,,,
  Worst airline to deal with. Just the worst! We booked our flight initially to go to New Zealand over Xmas 2020. The airline canceled the flights due to covid restrictions and refused to issue refunds. Instead we were forced to take flight credit and rebook. We booked again for Mar 2023 but I started having a severe back pain weeks before my flight and it got worse over time. I called up to ask for flight credit again to re-book when my back pain is recovered but no luck. I got told that Air NZ only issue flight credit if there is a life threatening issue! Never going to book a flight with Air New Zealand ever again. Our excitement to visit NZ has vanished over this whole experience.,,,,,
" I have paid for both of my mom and my seats but requested wheelchair assistance for my 88 year old mom. I called to confirm our seats after 2 hours on hold on the phone. They said I don’t need to pay for our seats since I asked for wheelchair assistance. So they issued me a refund. Somehow, my gut was telling me that I have to pay for our seats again because I’m worried about my mom not being in the aisle. Make the long story short they insisted that we don’t need to pay for seats and we will have better seats. So they issued me a refund for the second time. Now it’s time to leave, we were assigned seats that were almost at the end of the plane. They’re uncomfortable that my old mom didn’t sleep the whole 15 hours flight. Not to mention that they didn’t have enough people to push my mom on her wheelchair in Chicago so I have to push her with our carry on. It was stressful and the worst flight I’ve ever flown.",,,,,
  I had to make an emergency change to my international flight with Air NZ due to a serious illness to an immediate family member. Air NZ customer service were not available to speak to over the phone as they had an over 5hr wait time at the time. I changed my flight through their online tool which charged me an exorbitant flight change fee. After taking the flight and waiting hours on hold I was finally able to get through to their customer service team. They informed me that since I had taken the flight they were not able to do anything (as they only provide customer service for new/unused tickets) and I had to email a different support team. I've been waiting for four weeks for a response from them and have not heard anything back. ,,,,,
"  I flew recently to LAX and back in Business Class. Its nice being recognized as a regular Air New Zealand customer. The crew on both flights worked tirelessly making sure everyone was sorted and comfortable. The meals were superb and give you the option to add extra items depending on which main course item you choose. The WIFI was fast and I was able to stream video. Snacks were available in the galley, all NZ manufactured items. In both cases after I went to the bathroom after dinner, I came back to find my bed had been nicely prepared for me. A special shout out to the Air New Zealand Ground Manager at check in at LAX's Terminal B.",,,,,
" The behaviour of Air NZ is disgusting. They are the most unhelpful, arrogant and sub standard airline out there at the moment. Over 12 days I battled with Airnz and their faceless customer services which seemed to be near impossible to contact, satisfactory outcome was never reached so I cancelled 4 flights to fly with opposition. I’m gold status with AirNZ but my wife and I will never choose to fly with them again. Had to go as high as the CEO and needless to say I can see where the mess is starting from",,,,,
"  They incorrectly notified me that my flight was cancelled, when it wasn’t, causing me to incur more than $500 in fees to reschedule my travel plans. And when I called to confirm, the first time I spent 1 hour on hold only to be disconnected, and the next time over 2 1/2 hours to speak to a representative. This airline is totally understaffed and unable to handle any customer service. Check in lines were also absurdly long and the plane so tight, with the seat in font of you right in your face and no leg room due to electrical boxes at your feet. Totally miserable flights and then flight attendant put my jacket under a bag and I didn’t see it, leaving it on the plane. No one to contact and emails go unanswered. ",,,,,
  Do not waste your time and money. Absolutely disgusted by the service I received from the staff. This airline will dodge you until you are well and truly past the point of frustration. Their staff are trained to purposely give you incorrect information to delay you. Good luck ever getting a refund if your flight gets cancelled. You are unable to contact anyone to speak to a human and unable to request a refund online.,,,,,
"  I booked this flight on 7th December for a flight in April 2023 Melbourne - Christchurch arriving at 2.30 pm Just 2 weeks later Air NZ cancelled this flight and offered an alternative flight arriving at 12.30 am the next day, or I could cancel the flight. Not wanting to arrive at 30 min after midnight I canceled the flight. Air NZ have refused to give me a refund only offering me a credit valid for one year. Under Australian and NZ law an air line must offer a reasonable alternative flight or refund the fare. Offering me a flight that arrives at 12.30 am when I planned to arrive at 2.30 pm is surely unreasonable.",,,,,
"  I flew to the US on the 1st of February and my return flight was booked for the 14th of February. Unfortunately my return flight was cancelled due to Cyclone Gabrielle. The first flight I was able to rebook on was the 20th of February, which means I am stuck in LA with no extra spending money and have had to book another 6 nights accommodation via a credit card. I lost the seat I had booked for my return flight (an Air NZ policy?) and have now been waiting on the phone for 3&1/2 hrs (and still waiting) to book a seat. I am unable to do this online for some stupid reason. I realise Air NZ were not responsible for the cyclone but they are responsible for providing their customers with actual customer service. They should so embarrassed about their shoddy dealing with this emergency. Don’t fly Air NZ. They are a disgrace.",,,,,
" We should leave at 14 February at Los Angeles, flight is cancelled, but now a day later we are still in Los Angeles and no response from Air New Zealand only one text message at 08.55 pm, with message that plane is leaving at 08.55 pm on the same day.",,,,,
" Avoid this airline at all costs. There is not one positive thing that I can say about Air New Zealand. Customer Service never answer the telephone. I made numerous calls to try and pre-book sports equipment and vegetarian meals, but all went unanswered. In the end a kind gentleman at Lufthansa (our main carrier) did this for me. I flew economy fair enough, but assumed I would at least get a seat to sit in. Sadly no, the passenger sitting next to me was very large and the seats very small, he put up the arm rest and occupied half of my seat plus all of his own throughout the entire flight. It was without doubt the most unpleasant experience I have ever endured on an aircraft. I discreetly complained to the cabin crew and asked to be moved, however they just laughed, told me the flight was full and studiously ignored me for the rest of the flight. Finally to cap it all our flight was diverted from Auckland to Christchurch due to flooding at Auckland. Here we were abandoned by Air New Zealand, but only after they announced that there was no accommodation available in Christchurch and there would be no flights back to Auckland for at least two days. We made our own way to Auckland (a bit of a road/sea/road/flight adventure) arriving 30hrs later. Obviously it is not possible to get help or complain to Air New Zealand by telephone because they never answer the phone. I did however email my complaints and surprisingly received a relatively quick response asking for all the information a second time. Regarding the diverted flight I await their decision as to whether they will refund the costs I incurred. Regarding the seating arrangements they simply said that they were sorry and that there is nothing they can do when situations such as this arise. Well perhaps they should not seek to maximise profits by reducing seat size (yes I did measure the seats and Lufthansa’s were bigger!) and expecting your average size adult to accept half a seat instead of a whole one. Choose another airline!",,,,,
"  Check in and service at the airport pure disaster to Lounge. Almost no staff, 2 counters only for premium check in. Pure chaos and no staff Staff prefer to hug known passengers and chat with them. Premium looks different. Check in und Service am Flughafen reine Katastrophe bis Louge. Fast kein Personal, 2 Schalter nur für Premium Check in. Chaos pur und kein Personal Personal umarmt lieber bekannte Passagiere und quatscht mit denen. Premium sieht anders aus. ",,,,,
  We had a great flight with air new Zealand. Easy check in online and selecting seats. The flight was slightly late departing due to cyclone Gabrielle coming in. The cabin was clean and crew were really welcoming and efficient. The seat was comfy for me (5 ft 4inches) and with the foot rest up I was able to nap. The food was from part of the business class menu and was tasty and a good size serving. Slight negative was entertainment as not a large new movie selection but the flight was only 3.5 hours. Happy to recommend.,,,,,
"  I had booked a flight for my husband and me for a flight from Wellington to Christchurch on February 13, 2013. Unfortunately, my American Airlines flight from Dallas to Auckland on February 1 was cancelled due to an ice storm in Dallas. American Airlines could not get me a new flight arriving in Auckland until February 14 at the earliest, so I had to cancel my entire trip to New Zealand. I spoke to an Air New Zealand customer service agent (after being on hold for 2 hours.) I explained the situation. The agent checked with her supervisor and relayed to me the bad news that I would not get a refund (tickets cost $170). I was told I could change the flight dates with a change flight fee of $64.72 for the two tickets, but I had to pick now the new fly date. Furthermore, she said I couldn't book past January 2024. (I plan to rebook my flight to New Zealand for February 2024.) So if I booked 2 tickets for some random date in January, then changed them when I finalized my travel dates for February 2024, I would have to pay a flight change fee again of $64.72. Given that my international flight was cancelled due to weather which was beyond my control, it seems reasonable that my fare would be refunded, or at least that I be given a travel voucher to use in the future.  I will not book with this airline in the future.",,,,,
"  This was a code share with Singapore Airlines from Paris to Auckland and on the return Auckland to Singapore leg SIA booked me on Air NZ. After flying 2 legs in Singapore Airlines premium economy the Air NZ seating was vastly superior, both comfort and space. Same 2-4-2 seating but in each row of middle four there was one seat empty so the configuration in the middle was actually 1-2. After reading so much bad press about Air NZ it was a surprise that the cabin crew made a huge effort to walk around the premium economy cabin and introduce themselves to each passenger by name, there was also a hot towel. But what made the Air NZ premium product vastly superior was the friendliness of the crew, they made an effort to replenish drinks and chat to customers and provided excellent service! Now the management of Air NZ need to catch up with their crew and improve their EU website which is a disaster, I actually tried to book this trip on AIR NZ but the website was useless.",,,,,
" Very good entertainment screens. Tasty food even though it was a short flight. Good space seats, did have escape row. Had a very good flight, was very impressed.",,,,,
"  Air New Zealand The Air New Zealand experience used to be one of the best in the world. Sadly it has fallen off so far, one has to question the upper management decisions. The premium check in at Auckland airport is horrible. Escape the chaos of the normal checkin to be bundled into the chaos of the premium check-in. Just the same do it yourself experience in a small room. The business premier seats now just feel old and poorly thought out. I don't want to directly face every single person boarding the plane. For some stupid reason face away from the window and directly at your fellow passengers. They have a distinct lack of privacy. The seat and cracks were dirty and dusty, it didn't appear to have been cleaned in quite some time, including previous passengers earbuds sitting clearly visible. As I write this onboard I can see fingerprint smears on the seat across from me. Nothing has been wiped down. I did bring this to the attention of the attendant, who did take the feedback and assured would pass it on with thanks. The food was just average. The movie & entertainment selection was pitiful, clearly lacking choice. Further to this anyone who has had to contact and deal with Air new Zealands contact centre in the past year probably understands how dreadful it is. Expect multiple hour wait times just to speak to someone if calling from abroad. I don't know if anyone from Air New Zealand reads this or cares. But if you do - you have fallen far from acceptable standards. It feels as if you no longer care and it shows. Poor. Zero wow factor. Fly someone else when possible.",,,,,
"  The business class experience with Air New Zealand is excellent. The cabin crew were friendly and attentive and nothing was too much trouble for them. The drinks were served well and more was offered, the food was OK, though not brilliant, and the lie flat beds (a mystery to set up, but the crew did it for us) were extremely comfortable. The stand out for us was the excellent customer service on the flight. However, we would not fly the route via Hong Kong again as the code share arrangement with Cathay makes it very difficult to pre-book seats and Air New Zealand customer service on the ground is non existent. A recorded message telling you that there is a three hour queue for the phone to be answered is unacceptable. We tried email and got an answer two weeks later telling us to phone. Ridiculous! We finally solved it by emailing the Air NZ office in Hong Kong and got an almost instant and helpful answer. If they can do it there, why not for UK customers?",,,,,
" Our first flight got delayed so much we couldn't make our second flight. We got stuck in Auckland and told to arrange our own accommodation, transport and food. This was because they didn't have the capacity to arrange accommodation for us. We were told in an email we would be reimbursed in 6-8 weeks. 8 weeks later, still no reimbursement. Getting a hotel near the airport was not a small amount of money for us.",,,,,
" Disgusting customer service, if they have any at all. They canceled my second flight and left me with a 6 hour layover and this meant I would miss my event. I tried to call them about it and waited over 4.5 hours on hold, until I eventually gave up. I emailed them and received a reply that it would take 15 to 20 business days for them to answer! If you can, fly with anyone else other than them.",,,,,
"  Air New Zealand the cheapest and stingiest airline in the world. On silver tier I have two complimentary lounge passes to use on this flight before I get upgraded to Gold tier. The app shows two lounge passes, but would not load the QR code for the lounge pass via the app. And because of this the lounge staff wouldn’t let me through because she couldn’t scan the code. Air New Zealand you benefitted off charging me 2k a return flight from Auckland to Brisbane on your variable fares and demand pricing schemes.",,,,,
" We took two different carriers on our flight to and from New Zealand so it was easy to compare and contrast the difference between air New Zealand and Cathay Pacific. The food on Air New Zealand was really poor with no variations across their meals and really unpalatable. They offered no vegetarian options - as we couldn't pre-book our meal due to booking originally with a different carrier this was a problem we explained but we were met with a pretty unhelpful server. The entertainment options are limited, the main service person (chief customer service officer or something like that) was really unfriendly and unhelpful and spoke with robotic replies and really like constantly telling you what to do over the microphone. They charge premium prices but they deliver a budget service and budget food leading to a bad experience all round. Cathay Pacific are far better and treat you like a human.",,,,,
"  I booked flights from Melbourne to Christchurch on 23rd December 2022. The flight was a fully flexible ""The Works"" ticket with insurance for a short 3 hour flight cost me in excess of 1200 dollars AUD. As a Kiwi returning home for Christmas, I decided to take Air New Zealand after the last international experience I had with them went sour but thinking maybe it was a one-off and to give them another go. I majorly regret giving them the benefit of the doubt. Firstly our flight was cancelled for ""operational reasons"". When the customers quizzed the ground staff they outright lied to us and said a weather event had forced the flight to be cancelled (What they didn't count on was one of the passengers being a travel agent who quickly called the girls at their contact centre and found out they lied). Absolutely no coordination from the ground crew, just told to stand by until the Air NZ contact centre rebooked us or go back to our hotels etc. I had just driven 3 days from Alice Springs across Australia to essentially be lied to and then told to go away. Most of us were rebooked for flights around half an hour later well after Christmas, some not getting home until as late as New Years Eve on rebookings. Widespread disappointment and they frankly did an awful job managing the fallout, especially for an Air NZ crew. Spoke to the travel agent passenger and she had cleverly managed to get herself onto a diversion flight to the Gold Coast before connecting with another Air NZ flight to NZ just in time for Christmas. All at no additional cost as per their legal requirements to make alternative plans for you if fair and reasonable etc. I call the call centre to try to make this arrangement also (given The Works ticket I have), get told that they can do this but I have to PAY for myself to get to the Gold Coast. I confront the staff on the front desk at the airport about this and they sheepishly ignore me, I confirm with the travel agent passenger again if she had to pay and was I entitled to do so like her? She confirms no she didn't have to pay and yes I was entitled to this. I put the questions to them assertively and they attempt to objection handle me (I seriously hate when customer service reps treat customers like their heads are filled with rocks). I speak to a woman from SwissPort who is standing next to them watching all this going on and she very kindly intervenes, confirms what I've been told by the travel agent passenger is the truth, gets me onto a Virgin flight within a matter of less than 60 seconds and the Air NZ crew sheepishly pretend they didn't just shaft me and that someone else from a different organisation actually fixed the issue. Pathetic. But I find a last-minute airport motel room and call it a day. The next day, I head to the Gold Coast. When I land, my bags go missing despite them supposed to be transferred through and waiting with Air NZ for loading. Fortunately, a kind soul from Air NZ actually assisted me with this but arguably it shouldn't happen. Lastly, while the cabin crew on the flight were very nice I got no hot meal. A minor thing by this point but missing bags, cancelled flights, no meal and an appalling response for a 1200 dollar ticket has confirmed what a few travelling Kiwi friends had warned. Air NZ is really starting to slip and its embarrassing.",,,,,
"  As tourists, and having travelled lot of other places in New Zelaand and the whole of Australia, cant help hut compare them with other airlines. We found the staff to be rude on two accounts. While we were waiting in the line, she preferred to assist the one behind us giving them priority. As a tourist from another country, you always feel unwelcomed by such acts and suspects about differential treatment becomes evident. In general, people in NZ and Aus are awesome and very welcoming but this incident really shook my opinion about Air New Zealand and its hospitality. When we put our bags, she charges NZD 20 for an additional 300 gms which was actually balances by lower weight of the other bag but the disappointment cane from she not being helpful in finding a solution. I would say Air New Zealand does not depict the true hospitality and warmth of Kiwis as in general Kiwis are great people. Disappointed by inconvenience, we did not complain but paid additional charges as a tourist would do in another country for peaceful trip further.",,,,,
" I booked the ticket with Air New Zealand using my miles with Air Canada. It was a direct flight from Auckland to Tokyo. Overall, it was a very disappointing experience. The ground staff I encountered was unfriendly and unhelpful to say the least. The ground staff member did not listen to my answers, so I had to repeat my final destination three times. Then she kept asking me for the Japanese resident card although I told her twice that I was a Japanese citizen travelling with a Japanese passport, which she was already holding. I asked for an aisle seat, and she never responded to my request. I was assigned seat 63K, a window seat in the last row of the plane. That caused inconvenience not just for me, but for the family who was sitting next to me and travelling with young children. As I was at the airport three hours before the departure and there was no online check-in, I find it difficult to believe that there were no aisle seats available at the time of my check-in. I understand the planes can be full and not all customers' requests can be met, but that should be communicated. I still do not know whether the staff member who ""assisted"" with my check-in did not hear my request, was not able to fulfil it or simply chose to ignore it. I travel often and I have been through many airports and check-in counters. I rarely encountered staff that was as unfriendly and unhelpful as the staff that I encountered at the Air New Zealand encounter on January 6, 2023. In-flight service also needs improvement. The meals were basic and repetitive. Fudge brownie was served three times during the 10-hour flight? There was no amenity kit that is standard on most international flights. The movie selection was also poor. In addition, the crew did not seem to pay attention to the passengers. When drinks were served between the meals (which happened rarely), the crew seemed to notice only the passengers seating in the aisle seats. My general impression was that they did not seem to recognise that they were there to serve the customers. Compared to Asian airlines like ANA or Korean Air, Air New Zealand service leaves a lot to be desired. Considerable improvements are needed if Air New Zealand is to compete on the global stage. I would think twice before booking the ticket with them again.",,,,,
" I missed my return flight to NZ from Seoul to Auckland due to bad weather of my other flight (not connected) in Germany. I tried in every ways to contact Air NZ and put my every effort; however, there is literally impossible to contact Air NZ when you are in trouble - I waited phone on line - it took hours but no response; I emailed- no response even after more than a week. In contrast, I wanted to contact customer care of other airline (e.g. Qantas) for my need and was easily accessible and they responded to my needs. Regarding in flight service - on my way to Seoul, I requested a cabin crew to give me two glasses of water. I was surprised to see that he brought water holding the glasses putting his fingers soaking into the water and served it in a disrespected manner I had ever seen. I must say other cabin crew were helpful and respectful except that guy. I don't think Air NZ customer care is up to the standard and meets customer needs. I believe others have similar experience which is not good to build customer loyalty and to be competitive in the market. ",,,,,
" The worst airline in the whole world. Majority of the staff I work with are unprofessional, under trained, and rude as hell. They don’t even bother helping you when you need it and I had this problem on the way to Hawaii and on the way back home. Prior to my flight back home, I paid $120 to check in an extra bag. Got to the airport checked in. Only at the gate they told me that one of my bags wasn’t loaded onto the plane as I never paid for it. I showed them proof of payment and then only they loaded it. Why wasn’t this done at check in? Oh I know why - I was attended by a new employee who kept giving me death stares and talked as soft as a mouse, half my time wasted was me asking him to repeat himself. He also made me pay double money for my visa as he gave me the wrong information the first time. Seriously this airline needs better trained staff.",,,,,
"  Our family has traveled with Air New Zealand for decades making many trips each year between the US and NZ. It has, in the past been our preferred airline. But dear god, what a complete debacle this last trip has been. From trying to make simple flight changes that took four phone calls and over 8 hours on hold to execute to the latest extremely frustrating experience of lost bags that didn't make the flight. 48 hours later, we are spending over 4/12 hours on hold to try locate, no representative has picked up yet.  Seriously poor job Air New Zealand with ridiculously expensive fares charged to boot. Service is worse than a third-world nation. Will we get our bag for Christmas - we hold zero hope we will receive any service or resolution.",,,,,
  Unfortunately my experience was exactly as I’ve come to expect from our national carrier. Air New Zealand are operating a budget airline experience at full service prices. The seats on their “new” A320 neo’s are some of the poorest I’ve experienced in a full service carrier. The design of the seat backs feature a hard plastic curved back meaning anything you intend to store in the seat back pocket - forget about it. Tablets and laptops will bend or snap if you attempt to store them here. The seats also offer only a half seat that doesn’t come to the back of your knees even for very short people. The portion size for meals are smaller than the size of an iPhone 14 Pro Max (not an exaggeration) and meal choices were limited after the first 9 rows as they had run out. The cabin was not adequately cleaned as there was food on my armrest and rubbish / chewing gum in the seat pocket in front of me. To top it all off Air New Zealand damaged my luggage for the second time this year.,,,,,
"  I have been very loyal to Air New Zealand for decades even though most of my flights would have issues/delays. But these delays and rescheduling have been beyond of the joke now and I will be making a point of flying with a different airline from now on and I recommend if you want quality service that you don't fly with Air New Zealand anymore. The problem with Air New Zealand is their attitude with their constant rescheduling and cancellations, they don't care. If I ran my business like Air New Zealand does I would be out of business as they don't care about the customer and the upheaval they create on each flight. Prime example is my last flight (and almost every flight) I finally get 3 days away from work to fly away and again a last minute cancellation which I had to rebook and we loss 1 day of our 3 day holiday ... this doesn't sound like a big deal but since lock downs this was our first weekend off and since I work 7 days a week this was a holiday I was really looking forward to it. Then on the way home another rescheduling by Air New Zealand. If you ring up to complain, expect over 1 hour (I gave up after 1 1/2hrs) on hold. I love supporting kiwi companies, but enough is enough and i recommend if you can book with another airline - unless you enjoy long waits in airports, losing room bookings, last minute scrambling to reschedule flights, car rentals and appointments. It is no longer worth the stress and effort, I am sure other airlines would give a damn about their customers as I know Air New Zealand doesn't.",,,,,
 Original flight cancelled without notice. Can’t manage booking online and four hour hold on telephone. I have flown with them several times in the past but won’t do so again!,,,,,
"  Staff didn't seem to care. The plane was dirty, everything is self serve, no one to help. I was served a mince and cheese pie as a meal. Seriously this is no longer my national airline, I'm more ashamed of them using the name of New Zealand. Staff still seem to have that elite mantra that they no longer deserve.",,,,,
"  Very disappointed with Air New Zealand. I’ll avoid flying with Air New Zealand if I can in the future. On both occasions this year it has departed late, 45mins when flying to US and 0ne hour this time flying to Asia which made me miss a connection in the US and recently bags did not arrive at final destination due to late arrival for connecting flight. Barely had 30mins to run to connecting terminal. Also running out of food in Biz class is a first. On the occasion I’ve flown biz class with other airlines I’ve never experienced this. Portions were very small and I’m a small eater. Barely had any service for snacks in between meals So was quite hungry. Service wasn’t impressive by comparison to other airlines. I think Air New Zealand can do better and spend $ on improving service plus departing on time rather than fancy adverts.",,,,,
"  Air New Zealand cancel and reschedule flights without informing customers. I booked a flight Brisbane to Dunedin via Christchurch to arrive one day before embarking an Antarctic cruise. I made the reservation several months ago but only today found out the Brisbane to Christchurch first leg of the trip had been rescheduled to two hours later meaning it didn't arrive in Christchurch until after the departure time of my second leg to Dunedin Air New Zealand didn't bother to reschedule the second leg or to inform me of the change. I have spent all day on the phone to Air NZ who tell me it is not compact policy to inform customers of changes to their reservations. With flights now booked up for next week I am having to fly on Sunday in order to arrive in Dunedin in time for my afternoon cruise departure. Two extra nights hotel and sustenance, and not so much as an apology from Air NZ. If you are mad enough to make a reservation with these folks make sure you check your reservation on a daily basis. They could change it anytime they like and you would not be informed",,,,,
  You have to be careful with the workers at Nukualofa airport. It seems that they are either ignorant about how to proceed with the boarding or they want to take your money leaving you on the ground and forcing you to buy another ticket without any reason that they can explain. The next day they let us fly without any problem with the same Spanish passports and the same authorisation to enter New Zealand.,,,,,
"  Air New Zealand delayed their flight by 10 hours because staff resting requirements. They sent us an update 12 hours before the flight. We were in Singapore so checked out and went to an airport to talk to someone as we would miss all connecting flights and picking up our fur baby on time where she couldn't stay another night. There was no onefrom Air NZ at singapore Airport, the info center said use their help line. The wait time was 4 hours, by the time we rang them we had 1.5 hours left before the flight we could have re booked. By the time they picked up it was 4 hours later, very stressful situation. We were stuck in an international Airport with no one to talk to except stay on gold 4 hours hoping someone would pick up. You should be ashamed",,,,,
"  Air NZ have been disappointing for some time now. I am one of their premium customers and where possible try not to fly Air NZ, unfortunately they are our national carrier and key option when travelling NZ and overseas. The service, consistency of service and lack of quality business class is disappointing. Hope they get their act together but glad plenty of competition on USA routes has come! Air NZ is overpriced and an average experience all round!",,,,,
"  Service was typically Kiwi which was extremely friendly and never fails to deliver, every staff interaction was great and the food was outstanding. The only problem that the FREE wifi wasn't working but has worked well in the past so I think this was an outlier but did not detract from the flight.",,,,,
"  After 3 years of covid, I finally took a trip overseas. Unfortunately Air NZ was a huge let down and I'll probably avoid flying with them again. Here's why: Check in for 300+ passengers was run by 3 staff so our flight boarding was over an hour late (flight delayed 1.5h). On flight service was below average - took 2.5h for the first meal to arrive, no service in-between meals, and staff were standoffish even though I was extremely polite and patient. Second drinks and snacks were unavailable to be ordered. The air hostess told us that the attendants were busy due to ""turbulence"". We experienced no turbulence through the entire flight. Another air hostess told us we could order food through the screen, but this option told us that the kitchen was unavailable through the entire 9 hour flight. The meal portions were smaller than I remember. Considering the increased prices of tickets, this was quite disappointing. I'd rather try a different airline than ever fly here again Sorry NZ. You've lost a kiwi for life.",,,,,
"  On 8th November I travelled Sydney to Auckland, Flight NZ102 having paid more for The Works meaning I would receive a meal. It was appalling. Please bear in mind that this class of ticket is considerably more than just Economy. There were three choices, all rather pathetic and chose what I considered to be the best of the three. Salmon with pasta and courgette. Sounds fine but what was served was a small hand palm size portion of pasta with a few peas and sweet corn scattered through the minuscule amount of sauce. It was dry and unpalatable. On this all economy flight the toilet at the front of the cabin next to the flight deck is extremely small and the seat only just reclined slightly. My return flight on NZ 107 22nd November, Auckland to Sydney was quite delayed. Not the airline's fault but no food or beverage voucher offered. This time I was also The Works. Thought it could not possibly be as bad as the previous flight. I was wrong. This time decided to choose meat pie. Atrocious soggy pie complete with gristle in a paper wrapping and impossible to eat with the wooden cutlery as it was not served in a container. I read the packet and was shocked to see that they are pre frozen. Thank goodness for the Kapiti ice cream! What has happened to Air New Zealand that they are cutting corners so much across the Tasman. I have been doing this journey for many years and it used to be a pleasure and something to look forward to. Why oh why is the airline jeopardising its good name?",,,,,
"  We had all boarded and then it was announced that there will be a 30 mins delay. Surely the staff would have been aware of this delay and not board passengers till issues resolved? But ok, things happen, no big deal. Then the food options were announced, absolutely disgusted with the food choices! Our flight was at 9.30am so obviously breakfast service, 2 choices were muesli with yogurt or egg & sausage fritter - no fruit salad, no bread roll. Nothing! Since we don't eat pork or beef, we ended up not eating anything at all! and the drinks were only served once. I have flown with this airline numerous times and drinks have always been served twice. So after delay flight, we arrived at our destination starving. Prices of fares have gone up while the rest of services provided have gone very down. Very disappointed and will most definitely will only be using this airline as a last resort. (if ever again)",,,,,
"  Will never fly again. First, our original flight got canceled the night before due to emergency repair. We then got rescheduled to a later flight which wasn't the worst. But what was unacceptable is that we had assigned seats on row 16 but somehow got put in row 29 which was the last row of the plane. How does that happen. If our original flight got canceled, then assumed those other passengers from original flight would gave also been rescheduled to this flight and seat assignments should not have changed so much where we got put in the worst seats that don't recline and right next to the toilet. ",,,,,
"  Never before flown with an airline that completely ignored its customers. Despite severe delays that caused us to miss our flight to Los Angeles, the staff on the flight showed no desire to try to help us. They were rude and arrogant when we talked to them. The staff at the information desk did give us a hotel room, but not once did they apologize for the delay and the day we now miss at the destination. Will never recommend anyone to fly with Air New Zealand.",,,,,
"  My recent flights with Air New Zealand, for work and personal, have been relatively easy, service was good, only slightly delayed. The fares, however, vary enormously. My advice is to book well ahead. However, this complaint is about a flight I did not take from Christchurch to Wellington on July 17, for work. It was canceled at the last minute because of Covid. Because my meeting was scheduled for that morning, I could not take a later flight. The service person at the airport was very helpful. I later tried to claim a refund online for my seat reservations and advised of the cancelation (the booking was done through my work, which has also been trying to get in touch to claim the refund). Now, I completely understand that Air New Zealand has been facing ongoing severe problems because of the pandemic. But it would be good to get a refund or even to be able to contact the airline. Wait times for the call centre apparently are up to five hours. I emailed them and received a reply one month after the cancelation to apologize for the delay. Since then, neither myself or my workplace have heard anything. A warning to passengers: If your flight gets canceled through no fault of your own, you may not receive a refund or hear anything. This is deplorable. Air New Zealand customer for 50 years.",,,,,
"  Going from Auckland I was on premium economy no complaints about that every thing was very good. On my return I was sitting in economy and I was hoping will be very good service specially when you fly long haul flight but everything is was opposite. Food very ordinary, after serving special food al most after 30 minutes later they come with drinks. We have received 2 meals so in my first meal I ate my food couldn't wait for drinks but in breakfast i though I wait for drinks then start my breakfast. By the time i have received the drinks including tea all my meals were cold. Secondly they are very slow in serving meals. The earphones are very cheap. Overall I was not expecting this from Air NZ. Hopefully they will read the review and try to maintain their quality of service in future.",,,,,
"  In May 22 I booked, very deliberately a direct flight Auckland to San Francisco. 3 days before the flight I was informed the direct flight was not happening, my choice to fly the same day was via LAX. Although I paid a business class flight I would be bumped to Economy with United for the LAX SFO flight. So no big deal you say. But take into consideration one of the busiest hubs in the world, customs, security , pick up bags, drop bags off, travel by bus to the other terminal wait 3 hours in transit, its not the premium and easy trip I paid for. Same issue on return. It was no small thing at 69 to pay extra to avoid these issues, have a comfortable flight , minimise time spent in transit and definitely avoid LAX. And a last minute change making it too costly and difficult to make alternative plans.",,,,,
 Boarding was due to start 8:10. Flight time 8:40. The captain strolled in to airport gate around 8:50. Unapologetic and acting like doing us a favour by showing up.,,,,,
"  Personal interest in passengers non existent. Gone from being best airline to the absolute worst. Not sure why we even book codee share through this airline. Would not honour vouchers into the Lounge, even though we had booked and paid through the Air NZ website and Premium Economy. Flight was code share with Singapore Airlines but even though it was all booked and paid to Air NZ - they didn't want to know.",,,,,
" I am appalled by their lack of customer service. I purchased an Air New Zealand flight through E-dreams back in May 2021. The flight unfortunately had to be cancelled due to border entry restrictions due to the covid outbreak. I have, from July last year, to present day been fighting to get my money back, all 1900 euros of it! I contacted E-dreams, they tell me they are waiting for the refund from Air NZ, I contact Air NZ, they tell me E-dreams holds my money!! I now have an email proof from E-dreams to say that they are still awaiting a refund from Air NZ, which I have now sent to the customer service department, but I doubt I will get any answers because they blatantly ignore all emails I send!! If you are selling your flights through a scam company then you are just as much responsible for fighting our case because the flight (your companies flight) was booked in good faith and the matter of the refund needs to be sorted!! Do NOT ignore your customers!!",,,,,
  The meals were well below standard of an international flight. Menu had two options for hot cakes and scrambled egg but by the time they reached the middle of the aircraft they only had the one option. They don’t provide you drinking water with the meal. The stewardesses are rude and unwelcoming. The inflight entertainment is limited. The seat is uncomfortable and doesn’t recline. There are no foot rests. ,,,,,
"  It is incredibly frustrating after a 24 hour plus connected flight and then landing at Auckland from Sydney for the last leg just to find out they somehow lost/misplaced my luggage on the 25th and till now i haven’t got my luggage back after being told that they found it, and that it will be delivered to my address. I haven’t heard anything since, no confirmation or reply to my emails, when the website clearly says I can expect daily updates from them. Calling the baggage services is also a nightmare as you could be waiting on the phone up to 3 hours for someone to decide to pick it up, but so far, i have not had enough time to do that, and only able to wait an hour and nearly 12 minutes before my own life has to take over for other things. Since then, after several calls, including customer service staff who said they cannot help me, nor patch my call through to baggage services, I have not had a satisfactory answer or satisfactory service from Air New Zealand and I am feeling very unimportant. As a last resort after doing their internal survey, which apparently was not even being monitored, i also emailed their feedback team, and i got an automatic response that I might get a response from them in 6-8 weeks no less! Unreal!",,,,,
  Was not seated with my partner whom we booked our flight together on the whole way back to Christchurch from Rarotonga. And our flight Auckland to Christchurch was canceled and we were messed around getting to hotel for the overnight stay.,,,,,
"  Extremely basic and budget feel airline. Flying regional, which is as basic as it gets anyway, at my mistake I was too late to check in, however, with still 13 minutes on the clock and passengers boarding in process, I was denied any help of getting me on the plane. If anything, staff  was extremely rude in handling the matter. I understand this issue was my fault, however, we’re not on a long haul flight here. Some sort of help would’ve been appreciated and and least a smile on their face goes a long way, thanks for nothing.",,,,,
  I checked in and secured my boarding pass. On boarding I was informed your seat has been changed for a better leg room only to discover that I was moved to sit with one of the dreaded gang members in their full regalia. Racial profiling at its best. I felt I was sacrificed.,,,,,
" Auckland to Houston. I was excited recently to fly on the much lauded Dreamliner! The food was tasty and enjoyable, the ease of connection to Des Moines, USA was fabulous. But I was so cramped in my seat, it made the journey only just bearable. I’m a good flyer, always enjoy it; it was so disappointing to find the airline has penny pinched on seat comfort for the bulk of their passengers, the economy class folk. I’m a slim 67 kg; I don’t know how larger people could manage it. It puts me off ever travelling there again.",,,,,
 Christchurch to Nelson. Never ever recommend flying DOMESTIC in New Zealand. Most of the time I see AIR NZ delayed so it spoiled your schedule. First they give reason for delay due to weather. After they put on hold due to not put the fuel on time. They have no value of time. Really feel bad. I have to cancel all the other plans just for AIR NZ.,,,,,
"  After a long work day, my flight home was cancelled due to bad weather. I'd had a series of unpleasant personal events earlier that week so this was the cherry on top for me. I was only in Wellington for the day so had nothing with me and no place to stay, so felt rather overwhelmed and was upset. The Air NZ staff member (male) who was working at 6pm on Wed 17 August turned my day around, reassured me and provided my with a taxi voucher, dinner and food vouchers, and a hotel stay. This man was compassionate and kind and provided amazing service. I'd like to make sure he gets the recognition he deserves, but also that Air NZ is thanked for their incredible service. My experience with the airline staff was pivotal to my week and I am extremely grateful.",,,,,
"  Just had the most wonderful service from the Wellington crew on Flight 562. we were in row 28 I left my handbag behind a staff member called Wesley allowed me off the plane so my nephew and girlfriend could bring it security and then the rest of the flight the staff were so friendly kind and considerate. I dropped a knitting needle and the hostess got down on her knees to look for it. Thank you for allowing me to get my handbag, we fly to Vancouver on Friday to our sons wedding will need that Visa Card. Excellent experience truly grateful to you all.",,,,,
"  I was flying business class, and I am a Gold card holder. On arrival at Auckland, my bag did not arrive. I waited for 30 minutes, and had to queue to give my details, nearly missed my connecting flight. My bag arrived 5 days later, all good. But it was never lost. I was told that it had been taken off for weight reasons because the flight was so full (my bag weighed 17 kg, it was the total weight that was the issue) Two questions - why, when I was paying so much more, and my bag had a “priority “ sticker, was my bag chosen? They Knew all along that the bag wasn't lost! In the meantime, I have had to buy new clothing, including a suit for an important event. This is really poor. I would not have minded waiting for my bag had I known",,,,,
"  Auckland to Singapore 30th June, Returning 12th August. The midnight flight to Singapore had no issues. But very disappointing when Air New Zealand decides to blackout the windows after an 8.40 morning departure back to NZ Passengers have only just got up to catch the plane and might have wanted to see some beautiful views on a sunny, clear flight of 8 hours plus. You might have had kids or be a photographer or just an avid flyer who wanted to see the world from your windows....But No. Not on Air New Zealand. They just expect you too sleep after you just woke up. Sad, and will not fly with them again, nor would I recommend a day flight with them. Plenty of airlines with A350s, A380s or 777's.",,,,,
"  The expected hectic experience of flying international post covid for the first time was just fine. Air New Zealand ground staff were excellent and organised and the plane was on schedule. In fact they started boarding 45 minutes before takeoff and we left 15 minutes early, arriving 25 minutes early. It was my first experience on the 787 and apart from the 3x3x3 seating it didn't feel like a wide-body. It was cramped and even with my 180cm frame and a 3 hour flight, the legroom was terrible in economy, a far cry from most 747 and A380 aircraft I've flown on. In flight entertainment choices were well suited to under 40s not older passengers. Good food and beverage choices for an economy cabin. Well done to Air NZ for getting it's act back together after a terrible time - maybe worth considering better aircraft than the 787 and slightly more generous legroom.",,,,,
"  I had to make a quick trip to LAX and back recently, one way in Premium Economy and returning in Business Class. On the outward journey the Premium Economy cabin was full. The staff were amazing and were visible in the cabin through the night. I was impressed with the space in my bulkhead seat. The meals were of very good quality. The return journey started out with a bump at check in at LAX. A lot of people (including myself) did now know that a Travelers Declaration had to be filled out online before you could enter New Zealand. All credit to the manager working the Business Class Check in, she had the patience of a saint dealing with all these confused and mildly angry travelers who know nothing of the Travelers Declaration requirement. When I was in the Star Alliance Lounge later, the same manager from check in made sure I had got the Travelers Declaration sorted and wished me well for the rest of the journey, top marks for remembering me and checking that I was all sorted.. The rest of the journey home was seamless and just like the Air New Zealand of old, pre covid. The staff were attentive and helpful. Nothing was too much bother for the staff. If you wanted a second dessert, no problem, just ask and you will receive. I got up to go to the bathroom after dinner, came back and my bed had been nicely made. The meals were superb and a cut above the already very good meals on the Premium Economy flight over. My only criticism is that the seats definitely feel a lot tighter than the 777’s, especially for sleeping.. Some airlines may have a better hard product, but that Kiwi warmth and kindness just cant be surpassed.",,,,,
"  They canceled my flight after postponing it 4 times. I was reaccommodated on a flight that same afternoon with a stopover in Auckland. Flight that was also cancelled, having to spend one night at the place of origin and losing payment for my stay at destination. I was waiting 5 hours in the customer service line and they never answered me. The next day I was able to communicate with the intention of getting a flight and there were no flights available, I wanted to claim the full refund of my ticket and they did not want to refund the money, they did not take care of the stay at the place of origin or at the place of destiny. They said that the stay had to be approved in advance, how can I have the stay approved if they never answered the phone after 5 hours on hold? I wanted to change the date of the flight and they wanted to make me pay a fee, I asked them for alternative transportation options (buses, rent a car) to reach my destination and they did not accept it. Terrible customer service, terrible treatment.",,,,,
"  So we asked for an upgrade to business class from premium economy which we bought a year ago so they said they will try and after 6 days of nothing they change our flight tickets and downgrade us to economy even though we bought premium. I am very upset and disgraced, not going to do international travel with them again.",,,,,
"  ANZ only continues to go downhill. Food was less than average, crew barely polite, treated food like it was trash whilst serving. Leant over to window seat I was in the aisle seat with food on the tray. No ""excuse me"" or apology for being rude. The ambulation of some crew sadly would need PAX to save them in an emergency. Crew member rolled food trolley over my toes they were not extended out into the aisle. Air New Zealand just keeps getting worse. CEO makes endless excuses for 6 hours waiting for the call centre that just don't hold up.",,,,,
" This is my first experience with Air New Zealand and the worst airline for customer service. My ticket was cancelled and rebooked on a non optimal flight without advising me. On day of departure I was refused check in even when I arrived 3 hours prior to departure, told to go away and book another flight on their customers service number. When I rang was on hold for 2 days getting redirected and hung up on with no resolution. Tried visiting Brisbane office but this has now closed. Airline did not accept any responsibility for their terrible customer service. As such I am out of thousands of dollars from missed connecting flights and accommodation. I will never trust or choose Air New Zealand for my flights.",,,,,
"  By far the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. They cancelled my flight and did not offer any assistance or other options. The changes cost me $800 of my own money changing hotels, other flights etc. There was no remorse and not even an apology. I spent 3 hours on hold with no answer on 2 occasions. I will never think to book an Air New Zealand flight again and will certainly not recommend this airline to my family, friends and colleagues. I have no words for how disappointing their ‘customer service’ is. I’m shocked that the airline hasn’t been forced to close their doors with this kind of treatment to a customer. I’ve never sent a negative review in my life but this needs to be shared.",,,,,
  Terrible service. I paid for a seat which cost me $5 extra on top of my flight. I get on the plane only to find an old lady in my seat. I asked if she’d paid for that seat and she said no and she just sat there. So I decided that I would not pay for my seat allocation again and I would just sit there also. Jumped on my plane today and just sat in the seat that I like only to be told I must sit in my allocated seat. I don’t get it? Am I not given the same treatment as some lady? If somebody can take my seat without paying for it then so should I but nope. Double standards. Terrible airline.,,,,,
" Don't trust them, we booked Brisbane - Auckland return in Premium economy and they downgraded us to economy with no offer of a refund. I then paid $380AUD to get one leg upgraded back to Premium economy. That's fraud. Waited on the phone for over two hours to be told by the bloke in the call center ""tough - that's the way it is"". Not impressed - particularly at the total dishonesty!",,,,,
"  Due to the pandemic, I have been unable to fly with this airline as of yet. My entire experience with this airline and their service dealing with pandemic related issues was the most frustrating and financially costly experience I have ever had with any airline. My family bought tickets to fly out during the spring of 2020, which for obvious reasons fell through. Over the course of the following two years, we pursued every possible avenue to receive a refund for those tickets as we were either unable to fly due to pandemic restrictions in the US and New Zealand, or in the case of this year, members of my family became financially incapable of travel. Even though we reached out many times to make our case for getting out money back so we could travel when everything was safe and we were all financially stable again, the airline refused to budge on the issue. I ended up having to call in to their service line to personally address the issue rather than approach it through emails. Even after years of dealing with our tickets being held up in purgatory and our financial situation getting worse, the final nail in the coffin came today as I received a $175 phone charge for the 44 minutes I had to be on the phone to get half of my family's money back. After years of dealing with this airline, they only chose to refund us a little less than half of the money that we had to contribute, and only because that was the money we were forced to pay in order to maintain our tickets the last time the cost went up. We still have thousands of dollars held up in tickets we may never be able to use. Always get fully refundable tickets from this airline, do not accept their Disney dollars, and do not give them the opportunity to screw you. They do not care about their customers, and after I take this flight some time in the next few years, whenever my family is financially able to, I will never fly with them again. If they would have refunded us the first few times we tried, I would happily fly with them again, but their terrible customer service and lack of respect for the situations many of their passengers find themselves in during these uncertain times leaves me furious and defeated. I hope to never have to deal with this airline ever again, and I am not looking forward to flying with them for my mandatory trip to get rid of my points that I cannot get back.",,,,,
"  Return tickets for economy (Perth/Auckland) $2400. Expensive because they are the only ones that fly direct on this route. Seats are very narrow and hard to get into. Even though this is almost 8 hour flight you will have to pay extra for any food, drinks and entertainment. I will avoid this airline again and use Jetstar which is cheaper and has the same add on features if you wish to pay extra.",,,,,
"  We were unable to add luggage via the website. While adding bags at the airport would usually incur a higher cost, the staff allowed us to pay the online price - which was greatly appreciated.",,,,,
"  Very good service service, sandy Cornish was outstanding. Meals we had selected were not available, she went all the way to see that we got our selected meals. We appreciate such dedicated staff in Air New Zealand.",,,,,
"  Flew in comfort on Boeing 787 and felt  more refreshed & hydrated after the flight. Not all business class seats had overhead locker, so I had to put my bag under the ottoman opposite my seat. The seat leather/ottoman isn't that soft, but provided good recline. Having seat sideways gave easy view to passenger(s) on the right, so privacy isn't maximum. The service may be a bit get-it-out-of-the-way at times, but the professionalism & courteousness  was excellent. Some staff very proactive into going their way to help passenger. The food/beverage choices were diverse. Flavours sometimes weren't strong enough though. Lighting can be improved with more colours. The quietness of cabin was nice, but bizarrely despite being at front of airplane turbulence's effect was still very clearly felt. Overall a pleasing flight.",,,,,
  Air New Zealand simply offers the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The are understaffed and unable to answer their phones or reply to any queries. Covid is no excuse for this pathetic lack of service. When you get through you are then put on hold again and they don’t come back to you or they cut you off.,,,,,
 Lovely Cabin Crew. Great service. Seat is good for a short 50min flight like this but not for a long-haul.  Everyone followed the mask regulations. Food (Cookies or lollies) were served at the end of flight due to COVID restrictions.,,,,,
"  It is not common sense to be offering snacks on disembarkation - absolutely ridiculous. Space issues, people with needs such as parents with babies, toddlers etc.. passengers needing to connect with other flights. Either offer the in flight service or don't - simple.",,,,,
" I live in Tauranga and travelled to Hamilton to place my two teenage daughters on flights to Wellington. The flight was at 7am with check in 30 minutes prior. The instruction email stated I must be there 30 minutes prior, meaning I should be checking in by 6:30am. A series of events meant I got to the counter at 6:34am, the young male pointed out I was 4 minutes late and went to his manager to let her know. He came back and told me I was too late for this flight and advised I would need to catch another flight and pay extra. When I had arrived at check in there were at least 4 staff prancing around with only 1 open kiosk. When I had words with the manager all 4 staff were suddenly available to offer their opinions on my situation. The manager was rude and spoke down to me. I had no choice but to pay extra for the next flight at 10:15am. Air New Zealand have their customers over a barrel, they are suppose to be our national airline, they are bleeding money so they are exploiting customers. The later flight was delayed and didn’t leave until 10:55am.",,,,,
"  We saw the baggage handlers being very rough with the bags. Then ours came out and it was broken. I took it to the Air NZ desk at Auckland domestic arrivals and the guy wasn't even wearing a mask. He told me ""I work alone in this office so why should I wear a mask? I don't have covid."" Then he told me: 1. My bag was cheap, that's why it broke. 2. It was too heavy. At 25kg. 3. I overpacked it. 4. Air nz would only pay 60% of the original value of the bag. I emailed them and 2 days later still no response. Pretty appalling behaviour from Air NZ.",,,,,
"  Air NZ I think I would say are one of the worst I have ever flown with. Customer service to book flights and giving the right information is very poor. Kept calling them everyday for flights back to any state in Australia and they would say there aren't any flights, but with family friends I know they have booked flights back to Australia and when I asked they said not possible, I even send them information that has been stated from the Australian government and they had no knowledge about it. They lie too much in the customer service department, I flew with them because some had said they are world class but for me that's nowhere close to being a world class airline. I don't think I would fly with them again.",,,,,
" My November flights were canceled and instead of providing a full refund or offering to replace the tickets for other dates, they just credited the amount online - it means that I can use the money within 12 month since cancelation (27 Oct 2021) and guess what - new tickets 5 month in advance for the same time of the day are more expensive now. What a bunch of scammers!",,,,,
"  I have booked many flights with Air Niugini. In the specific case, my flight from Honiara to Port Moresby has been Rescheduled (2:30hrs later). Because of this reschedule I will not be able to catch the last flight from Port Moresby to Goroka, and also be obliged to pay an Hotel in Port Moresby. I have written 6 times to AirNiugini Customer Service for a refund: no answer. I was told by friends that this happens very often. We are big travellers (EPS) and it’s important to give the message that this company is totally unreliable!",,,,,
" Flew Air Niugini because of the B767, very nice cabin in a 2x1x2 configuration. Took seat 2A, bulkhead seat, very comfortable with heaps of leg room. Staff were amazing and very attentive, food was OK, entertainment was enough for this flight of approx. 6 hrs.",,,,,
"  We flew from Brisbane to Port Morseby and while in POM we had several flights delayed and then completely canceled. We had to stay in POM for two days before finally flying out. We had relatives waiting for us in Popondetta during this time who had to travel a long distance to meet us and wait. Now coming home our flight from Popondetta was over two and a half hours delayed. This means that we will miss the flight from POM to Brisabane, and probably staying another night in POM. Absolutely disgraceful service from this company. Also seems like theirs no way of contacting any of the Air Nuigini offices by phone as you will just sit their on hold like I did today for 40 minutes before I gave up. ",,,,,
"  Air Niugini has ruined my Easter holiday. I have a holiday reservation at Walindi Plantation Resort, Kimbe, from 7-10/4. I have booked Air Niugini domestic flight from Port Moresby to Hoskins on 7/4. The 7/4 is canceled with a SMS notification at 10am on 7/4, and rescheduled to 8/4 3.25pm, which is fine as it's only one day difference. I check in again for 8/4, and this flight is further delayed to 4.45pm without any notification during the dropping of my luggage at counter, well, which is also fine for me as it's only 1 hour plus delay. Finally when we are supposed to queue up for boarding, at 4.45pm sharp, the airline makes announcement to cancel the flight, and reschedule to the next day 9/4, for departure at ridiculous 4.55am. If you can't afford to operate the flight, just don't take my booking or notify earlier in case of flight change so that we can manage our travel. For what that you still check us in, and get us waiting in the boarding lounge just for your cancellation announcement, instead of a departure. The customer service counter is full of chaos with the staff having no compassion to comfort the frustrated crowds.",,,,,
 Manila to Brisbane via Port Moresby. Delayed my plane by 36 hours. Wasted 2 days. Had paid for Business class upgrade but “they couldn’t find it in the system. Had no problems keeping the money.,,,,,
"  Terrible service. Well over 2 hours to check in, queues have no seats, not even been through security yet. Not a single apology or justification from a member of staff. Oh and they made sure the business customers pushed into the economy queue stands to be seen first.",,,,,
"  Without any doubt this is the most appalling airline I have experienced. Think Jetstar and it's even worse. 3 hours sitting on a dirty run down aircraft before we could get a glass of water. That of course included sitting in the heat on the runway for an hour before leaving. I've now just experienced their check in a return flight. Only 2 people waiting and it took 30 minutes before I got to the counter. If you have any option choose that, even if it is Jetstar. ",,,,,
"  Flew Wapanamanda-Port Moresby-Singapore on 20-21 March 2022. The domestic leg was on an old Dash8-200 aircraft always used on this route. It became the noisiest flight I have had for many years. Service on board given (juices and biscuits). Half load. Free seating. Allowed to check in 30 hours in advance. Flight delayed 25 Minutes which is bearable. Smooth check-in, and very fast luggage delivery in Moresby. The international leg was eased by the airline’s Helpdesk who advised promptly on corona and other documents requirements/changes to avoid any check-in panic or denial. Check-In took long time due to loads of document checks. 3 counters open was hardly enough for the only 60+ passengers, e.g. it took me alone 25 minutes to get a BP issued. Lack of a full alliance with e.g. Oneworld, complicates things – Qatar, who issued my ticket, including for onward flights, is only a partner. Lounge access in POM were generously given to all the airlines’ frequent flyers. Their lounge was good in terms of hot foods offering, view, and space (we were only 5 visitors to fill 145 chair-spaces). Drink offering were shockingly poor; absolutely no alcoholic beverages beyond milk and sodas - and the coffee was burnt to the level to call the fire brigade. The actual flight was on an aged, noisy, but well refurbished B767-300. Flight punctual and even early in both ends. FAs were kind and informative. The complete lack of alcoholic beverages is completely sub-par: it was apologized by FAs and said to be temporarily and change back by April 2022 to be re-instated. Only 1 meal service on a 6 hours’ afternoon flight is scarce. Food offerings were 2 options, beef and chicken – that complemented the offerings from Paradise lounge well where we had fish, fish-balls, lamb, and cheeses. No WiFi nor IFE onboard – but flight monitors at every seat made us know the name of all Indonesian islands passed. Power outlets provided at every seat. While business class was full, there were only a 10% load in economy which gave us all the space in the world to flat out. Can only rate to 7 of 10 but will add 1-2 more when the full drink repertoire returns.",,,,,
"  Singapore to Wabag via Port Moresby 2-3 March 2022 on B767-300 and Dash 8-300, respectively. Flights on time. Transit in POM was 3 hours which was just enough time to fully disembark, tests, transit, luggage, and check-in onward travel to remote provinces. Old aircrafts, both of >25 years of age but well taped together. Ground service and Helpdesk excellent, prompt and cooperative. At a certain stage the airline allowed me to keep the domestic ticket open as they realised the numerous changes: I had to change ticket 4 times due to strict and changing travel/entering regulations to PNG - all worsened by Corona and transit variations (first 2 legs from CPH via DOH to SIN) in Singapore including “transit clearances”, immigration’s approval, tests, visa, criminal record certificate, vaccinations, etc. What happened to all the fun in the World? Gate pass and Check-Ins were easy in SIN as well in POM. The airlines’ cooperation with Qatar Airways is smooth and ease procedures as reduce ticket price. Moreover, their Oneworld Cooperation granted me free access to Qantas Business Lounge in Singapore which was a great relief and a pleasure of some luxury. The first flight was a night flight and a fully acceptable hot dinner was served. Could stretch out and sleep even in the very noisy B767. No inflight entertainment (just map tracking). No alcohol offered on board on any of the 2 flights. Ample seating space. Mediocre on board services - but somehow OK. Airbridge only provided in Singapore - had to walk while disembarking in POM and onwards. Domestic ticket was reissued with ease in the international airport, and thereafter allowing me to check-in before entering the very crowded domestic airport 400 meter away. Baggage allowance followed the internal flight, otherwise only 16 kg, which is half. Domestic boarding gates were in the open under an open roof. It was clear and easy. Onboard, catering was minimal (juice and snack), but appreciated. The sole FA was well-groomed, effective, and took well care of my bulky hand-luggage put into a front cabinet. Underway, a ceiling panel dropped half-down in the cabin and was then hold up by passengers for 30 Minutes. FA tried to tape it up, but failed. The destination WBM has 2-3 flights per week and the trip took 90 Minutes over hostile, forest covered mountains. Would fly again.",,,,,
"  You can wait in a line to checkin, for hours, and get little to no customer service because the airline overbooked. They process executive “priorities,” and leave ordinary people to wait. In queues with no social distancing. There is no communication by Customer Service staff to help explain the situation. Sometimes they leave the desk, and disappear. Leaving us looking at each other, wondering what is happening. There is no empathy. These are trying times to say the least with Delta on the rise, but these situations can be avoided if airlines operated with compassion. It is unethical to overbook. It is unethical to rebook for flights knowing the airplane is undergoing maintenance. It is unethical then to provide no water or refreshments onboard a later plane - after passengers have been waiting 8 hours. We arrived in Port Moresby, exhausted, hungry, thirsty and traumatised - 9 hours later.  Customers deserve better service. I was later told that this is the new normal for Air Niugini and that has been occurring for the past three weeks and is expected to continue right up until Christmas as the airport gets redeveloped. This practice, on early bird flights to bump passengers off because of overbooking will continue. Air Niugini's Dash-8 fleet are old and in desperate need of repair. ",,,,,
"  Port Moresby to Hong Kong in December 2019. I was overweight on luggage. But the airport treatment I got, was traumatic. The power was off. The internet was off.  I either had to pay $800 or leave my bag behind. I wanted to pay the fine, but the power was off for hours. I could not change currency. I could not pay the customs, because they could not give me a receipt. I almost missed my flight.",,,,,
"  My itinerary was Manila - Port Moresby - Honiara - Port Vila - Fiji (plus some domestic). Several flight was with Air Niugini First they cancel my flight from POM-HON, which they of course never told me anything about. After today I realised that I shouldn't even have expect that. I then after that realised that I would have to stay 2 weeks in PNG to be allowed to go to Honiara after visiting the Phillipines because of the coronavirus. My next plan is to book a flight direct to Vanuatu. The flight is listed as direct but at the last step I notice a 50 min stop in Honiara for dropping of / unloading passengers. (No disembarking.) I decided to contact air niugini just to make sure this wouldn't become problem. 9-10 days later I still dont have a answer after emailing with 5 people via 8 different emails in 3 different countries. And yes, of we tried to call but never a clear answer. One even said we would be fine but another one said not possible. When checking in at Manila airport for the POM flight I'm almost denied boarding since my onward ticket is cancelled and I couldn't book my next flight because I never received an answer about transit rules. When arriving in POM I ask the Air Niugini office (they are actually friendly when explaining that they cant help you with anything.) They printed loads of the IATA travel restrictions rules that I already have on my phone and I was explaining them about. They said I would not be allowed to have any kind of transit in Honiara. (The Virus is a new thing so that most likely the reason we received so many different answers and no answers from most of them. Then I decide to just skip them both and go to Fiji. I have to choose the more expensive option to stop over in Brisbane. With Carry on 7kg I dont need any tra sit visa since I'm not leaving international gate. My backpack is 9kg. Checking it in (free) results in leaving international gate for re checking since they dint ha e sharevmcode with the next flight and this would result in me having to get a transit visa that obviously would take 8-12 days according to my application. I then asked the counter during one of my domestic flights if they could be so kind to let me go with 9kg and the entire problem would be solved and the guy said ofc, after all this trouble that should not be any problem. Just go over to the sales counter and get it confirmed. Nope, big no. Of course I couldn't bring a 9kg carry on. So now I'm stuck here forced to throw away 2kg of personal stuff to be able to get out of here.  I recommend to pay a bit more for another airline.",,,,,
"  What a joke, i had just arrived from Perth via Brisbane to land in Port Moresby for my connection to Rabaul. When i arrived in Port Moresby i proceeded from the international terminal to the domestic to check in for my next flight to find out i had been bumped onto the flight tomorrow due to the plane being downsized from the Fokker 100 to a Dash 8. They were not willing to compensate my accommodation costs for a night in Port Moresby, even though they have now just cost me my transfer and first nights accommodation in Rabaul. So demanded to be placed on standby for the flight in case nobody showed up on the flight. The check in staff had the worst attitude i have ever come across in aviation. I got lucky and was able to board the flight for it then be diverted to Hoskins, we then had to wait at Hoskins for Air Nugini to organise accomodation for our flight, this took them nearly 2 hours. I wont fly this airline again unless absolutely required.",,,,,
"  Fly from Brisbane to Port Moresby with Air Nuigini in Economy class today. Leg room in economy was a pleasant surprise! Food was first class. Cabin crew were very friendly & helpful. Let's be honest, no-one really likes flying economy, but it's so much cheaper than Business Class! But over all, I thought the trip was excellent! The only 2 negatives I have are: 1: Only 3 check in staff to book in a plane load of people. (There were 2 customer service staff working, well one was working & the other was surfing the web) 2: Excess baggage charges. You get a 30kg limit in Economy, but if you go over that they charge $21.00 per kilo.",,,,,
"  So we first had some trouble as the airline told us that we wouldn't be able to get our original flight but after some over the phone conversations with a very helpful woman in the Air Niugini base in Cairns we were able to get on another flight which was a day earlier. We were desperate to make it to Honiara so we agreed to taking this flight although it meant staying overnight in Port Moresby before going to Honiara on the original second leg of the journey the next day. We arrived in Port Moresby a bit confused and unsure as the what was going to happen, luckily we met a lovely woman who works for the Air Niugini airport team in Port Moresby airport. She was incredibly helpful, she sorted out our free overnight accommodation in the holiday inn which included two free meals and a very nice room and also shuttles to and from the airport. She helped us get out some money and advised us on how much we would need. She even helped us see the town because we wanted to have a look to see what was there so her friend showed us round in her car. Thank you! The flights were very nice with TV's and food and drink served on a flight as short as two hours. This was a plus but was unfortunate that we were delayed on the way there and that our flight got cancelled on the return journey.",,,,,
"  I was so looking forward to traveling with Air Niugini and not having to transit via Australia to get to the Philippines from Vanuatu. Unfortunately it turned out to be the worst airline travel experience to date. First our flight was cancelled after sitting at the boarding gate for 2hrs with no info other than 'there is an indefinite delay'. Then the flight was rescheduled for the next day, no info on our connecting flight was given until we arrived in Port Moresby from Vanuatu. The flight from Port Vila to Port Moresby was on a very old looking ATR aircraft, with no entertainment. Aircon was turned off for the 30 minute stopover in Honiara. Promises made by the Air Niugini ground staff to rebook my connecting domestic flights in the Philippines were not honoured and I was only advised of this after the scheduled domestic flights were missed, and only 5 minutes before boarding to Manila. No compensation was offered for the missed domestic flights or even an apology for providing the wrong information. Our baggage was then lost on arrival in Manila. 23 days later, there is still no sign of it and no compensation for lost bag to date. No response recieved to complaint email sent via website. Also no answer on phone numbers listed on website. Another complaint sent via agent in Vanuatu and response was simply 'fill out a form about your baggage' and 'our contract of carriage was only for Port Vila to Manila, no interline agreement'. So why did the staff advise otherwise? After losing baggage, buying new clothes and domestic flights (approx. $500), we requested an upgrade on return flight to have some positive experience with Air Niugini to look forward to. There was no response to this and the request at check in was rejected despite half of business class being empty. The airline also rejected the carriage of my traditional lanterns because Air Niugini exceptionally does not accept the carriage of any items that contain lights that aren't LED lights (I've successfully brought these lanterns in to Australia, USA, Vanuatu - never a problem). I requested they hold them until relatives could collect them the next day and was advised no storage space was available. After spending half a day driving to purchase them, I had to throw them away at the airport (another $100 lost). Air Niugini, you were such an epic disappointment and your poor service ruined our vacation. I understand flights occasionally get cancelled, baggage sometimes gets lost but your responses to customer issues relating to these things were inconsistent, incorrect or inadequate. In the future, I will avoid Air Niugini unless there are really no other options available. Don'tempted by their cheap prices! Like me, you could end up paying more than the cost of flying with a decent airline and have the added frustration and stress of having to deal with an airline that has no interest in resolving customer issues when at fault.",,,,,
"  The outbound journey was delayed 10 hours in Port Moresby. The delayed flight was organised to leave at 2am, however no ground staff at airport were organised, so we sit on tarmac until ground staff arrive at 5am. The return flight from Pohpei was supposed to leave Pohnpei at 2 am and actually left 9.45am. I turned up to airport at 2 am and found out the flight was rescheduled to 9.45am. I contacted AirNuigini twice via email prior to departure to confirm that no changes had been made. I received an email saying that your servers were not working. I was not contacted about this change, but others on the flight all new about this change a week before, as they had booked flights only a week earlier. Therefore, you new about the changes a week earlier, did not advise me or even book me on the forward leg of the journey. The flight leaves Pohnpei at 9.45am, but we are not booked on the continuing flight from Port Moresby to Brisbane. This flight leaves half empty, and several passengers are not booked on this flight because Quants reservations are not open on Sunday. People who booked the week earlier are however on the flight. We were then sent to Sydney Airport and a connecting flight arranged to Brisbane. When we land in Sydney, Qantas advise us that Air Nuigini connection to Brisbane is illegal because there is less than an hour between flights. The checkin had closed and there are no more flights that day. We are then stranded at Sydney Airport with no contact available from either Quantas or Airi Nugini. We then go to Flight Centre and are told there is only one flight left to Brisbane at a cost of $800. Some passengers take this option, but I don’t trust the airline to compensate me. So I am stranded with nobody to contact In Sydney at 7pm at night. Luckily some stranger took pity on me and let me sleep on their couch for the night. I contacted your airline in the morning and I was rebooked to Brisbane at 11am with Qantas. Qantas then advised that my 2 bags of 15kg were subject to excess baggage fee of $70. Eventually I got home at 12pm in Brisbane.",,,,,
  Bali to Madang via Port Moresby. The domestic side of this airline is an absolute joke! I spent 12 hours in the POM airport yesterday after arriving on the red eye from Bali. There was little to no info given and now I am back at the airport at 4am this morning and have been waiting for an hour with no check in line available yet.,,,,,
" Hoskins to Port Moresby. Waited 2 days for our cancelled flight to be reinstated even then we had to continually ask ground staff what was going on or for information. Eventually told 6 hrs later our plane arriving from POM was experiencing technical issues which was a total fabrication and lies, I received a phone call from a pilot friend who said they didn't have a captain available. I have been flying in PNG for 30 years and this has been the worst experience. By the way PNG Air managed 5 trips into Hoskins in a 10hr period and all their customers are enjoying Christmas with their families. Guess who I'm flying with in future. Way to treat your valued customers.",,,,,
"  Singapore to Port Moresby. Given the limited choice available on the market to reach Port Moresby (only Qantas and Air Philippines travel there) I was forced to take Air Niugini. It was a very pleasant surprise. Plane was not too old, cabin was very decent, clean, entertainment somewhat limited but of reasonable quality. Food was ok, plane is almost always empty, which means lots of space also in Economy. Board personnel is not as shiny as you could see on Emirates or Qatar, but kind, gentle and professional. A surprise.",,,,,
"  I was travelling on an Air Niugini PX187 from Mt. Hagen to Port Moresby on 31/3/2017. The check-in was a chaos and in the end flight was cancelled at short notice (as it was time to board), as was the flight on the following day we were transferred to (PX 181). In the end, the total delay was 24 hours. For the whole day on Saturday (8.30am to 5pm), we were made to wait at the airport with no food or water provided  and no information on when we might be able to fly. The staff were unwilling to help or offer any kind of assistance or volunteer any information. When I enquired about refreshments for the passengers I was told that it was 'not the airline policy’ to take care of their passengers even in case of delay which was entirely the fault of the airline. When we finally arrived in POM at 6pm on the 1st of April, our luggage was left behind. Again, no specific information was provided by the airline as to when they would arrive, only an approximate “maybe tomorrow”. We went back on the following day and received 1/3 of the checked in baggage. The other two bags didn’t arrive. My colleague went back again in the afternoon to check but still nothing. I gave up as life is too short for this (no chance the airline will follow up on your behalf). I wrote to the airline but haven't received a response. I have never experienced such attitude and negligence by any other airline in the world.",,,,,
  Sydney to Port Moresby. Air Niugini use a remote hard stand for boarding in Sydney. Passengers can expect to catch a bus to take them to the aeroplane. Economy Class Seat 12B.  The seat pitch on the Boeing 737-700 is ridiculously tight and is much much less than their 767s which I fly very often. I use Qantas 737-800s every 1-2 weeks and they offer a much better seat pitch. I am 189cm and my knees were jammed against the seat in front on the Air Niugini 737-700.  The seat cushioning and lumbar support is near non-existent and passengers should expect to have back and leg pain on arrival. The 767 is the same. The seats fail to lock up right and recline on take-off. My seat gradually reclined to the full reclined position on it's on which severely impacts the limited space for the person seated behind you. The IFE on their Boeing fleet (767 and 737) has issues. The touchscreens rarely work and register phantom touches consistently throughout the flight. These either sequence the exit movie button or turn the volume to max. The passenger in the seat next to me screen's orientation was upside down. The food is relatively good for an economy flight. General condition of the aeroplanes are showing their age. ,,,,,
"  
The most useless airline I have had the misfortune to experience. Booked flights in January for July holiday to take our mother back to Rabaul after 47 years for her 70th birthday. Arrived prior to the other 8 family members only to be advised my flight was cancelled. Rebooked on same day only for this flight to be cancelled. All due to the fleet being 'unserviceable'. No communication of cancelled flights, even when at airport. Forced to stay over night in Moresby, flight rescheduled for 8am, only to be cancelled. Finally after so many attempts, I had to pay $380AUS to fly with the alternative non government Air PNG airline so I could start my actual holiday and join my family. These forced changes rendered my pre planned expense and time useless. I felt sorry for airport staff who are placed in this position due to pilots striking. I felt very sorry for customers who were forced for to wait 5 days before they could get to their destination.

"Port Moresby to Brisbane with Air Niugini - relatively expensive airline although not on routes from PNG to and from Brisbane and Cairns in Australia. Planes are old but have been refurbished with quite comfortable seats and have quite a good in-seat entertainment system. The toilets are clean, which is a plus on any airline. Meals are actually very good and probably amongst the best of any airline I have flown with (at least in economy). However, what sets this airline apart from many is its cabin staff who are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble.",,,,,
"A smooth 2 hour flight with Air Niugini from Singapore to Port Moresby. Orderly boarding and very polite cabin crew. The plane was spotless. Varied selection of movies, music and television shows. Satisfactory meal and drink service. Would not hesitate to fly again or recommend.",,,,,
"Port Moresby to Singapore with Air Niugini, and they provided the best assistance and service I have experienced. The ground staff and the check-in service was wonderful and very quick. The staff is professional and helpful. The 6 hours flight from POM to SIN journey was very comfortable and relaxing. The crew were very decent and helping. Overall wonderful and memorable experience.",,,,,
"Over the past 40 years I've travelled to many destinations around the world on many different airlines, but none of them have even come close to punching above its weight than Air Niugini. I've been flying Air Niugini ever since I was pleasantly surprised over 18 months ago, and the experience has been consistently great. It is what one would expect from an airline, but to deliver a world class service amidst challenges is what makes Air Niugini stand out for me.
",,,,,
"Air Niugini planes in good condition, decent staff and good pilots. The food on the international 767 was good and the seats have good IFE but a limited movie selection.  It breaks down a bit on domestic flights though. The planes (Dash-8s and Fokker 70s) and pilots are still good and inflight service OK, although you'll only get 2 small cookies and a small juice container (finding plain water in PNG is bizarrely difficult), however ground service is pretty bad. Port Moresby check-in is a madhouse and locals check huge amounts of baggage (note that the free amounts are small - 5kg carryon and 16kg checked, although if you're connecting from international they will usually allow whatever allowance you had for that flight), which means that late arrivals are often bumped due to the plane hitting the weight limit - so check in early! And then hope that your luggage actually arrives - I've already had misdirected luggage on my 4th flight in PNG. The weather contributes to frequent delays and cancellations and the handling of rebookings is poor. Still much better than most domestic flight experiences that I've had in countries like this. Overall score of 7 considers an 8 for international and a 4 for domestic.",,,,,
Flew Air Niugini from Port Moresby to Brisbane return. Seating pitch was adequate and meals were good. Staff were friendly in the reserved Melanesian way. The planes are old although the they've recently (in the last couple of years) been refitted. Decent IFE for short-haul flights.,,,,,
"Air Niugini the most expensive airlines but poor service - I already paid my ticket 1 month before flight departure. They said that I must stand by because the flight was very full.  After that I give small money to one of Air Niugini officer that he helped me to get seat and finally I can get boarding pass and fly to Buka. This airlines I think like to sell ticket more than aircraft capacity and very bad attitude of company. The ticket is very expensive. The old plane was a Fokker 100. The plane was very dirty. 400USD Ticket POM to BUA with 1 hour 20 minutes flight, and Air Niugini just give 1 orange can juice and 1 biscuit snack. No Inflight Magazine.  Aircraft was full. Cabin crew was polite and professional.",,,,,
"Air Niugini from Buka Port Moresby with Fokker 100. Good experience. Inflight service was nothing for Buka to Rabaul flight due to short flight time just 1 hour, Rabaul to Port Moresby with 2 cookies and orange juice Only. Aircraft clean but very old. No inflight Entertainment, no newspapers, no inflight magazine. Flight Attendant to keep the safety procedure.",,,,,
"I've never had any reservations flying Air Niugini. Though the inflight product on the domestic sectors does not match the exorbitant airfares, the ground service and most flight attendants are usually excellent and professional. They do their best with what they've got. No IFE on domestic flights (POM/HGU is 1 hr flying time).",,,,,
"Early morning Air Niugini flight from Port Moresby to Brisbane. Check in fast and friendly. Immigration at Port Moresby was slow with just 2 officers. Boarded on time to a clean Boeing 767, seats had updated IFE with nice screens and good content. Crew professional but not the warmest. A good breakfast was served which was of good quality. Arrived into BNE 15 mins early. Being non busy time at BNE. Immigration cleared fast and bags picked up and out of airport in 20 mins.",,,,,
"The Air Niugini food was good for airline food on my flight Port Moresby to Hong Kong, and a decent amount of entertainment options as well. If you get seated in row 8 you have a lot of leg room and I am 6'4"". The airlines in the USA should learn how to have entertainment and food from them.",,,,,
"I flew with Air Niugini, 24 August 2015 from Port Moresby to Bali with a B737-700. Overall not very good in service and the flight attendants did the minimum. Check in at POM Airport is very poor, just 2 ground staff to do that and they are very strict with baggage handling and baggage weight. On the B737-700 there were 7 flight attendants but just 2 working in Economy Class causing a very slow service. Inflight Entertainment, seat and toilets were ok.",,,,,
"The flight from BNE to POM was on a B767 with an upgraded interior. IFE and very comfortable seating. The inflight service was excellent, the flight attendant provided a professional helpful service complete with an indepth and accurate description of the wines carried for the passenger seated next to me. In addition this same passenger was a vegetarian but had not pre-ordered a vegetarian meal, the flight attendant produced a very acceptable vegetarian meal. Her level of customer care was above and beyond much of what I have encountered on many airlines and I left the flight feeling that the service was far more than expected. What a difference a a flight attendant who is caring, professional and prepared to go the extra mile can make to a flight.",,,,,
"My daughter and I are back in Sydney tonight thanks to Air Niugini going the extra mile.  When the flight from Alotau to Port Moresby was cancelled we were in a challenging situation, then when the rebooked flight from Alotau to Moresby couldn't land because of difficult weather conditions we had to overnight in Alotau and hope to connect early through a rescheduled flight from Alotau the following morning. The Air Niugini staff at Alotau handled a difficult situation for customers extremely professionally both the day of the delay issues and through rebooking everyone on the rescheduled flight the next morning. ",,,,,
SIN-POM-SIN on B767s. Friendly professional and efficient service from the crew made the flights bearable. Flights were largely on time. Exit row 10 had unbelievable leg room but it also meant other passengers climbed over us to get to the toilets in the other aisle. Food was ok. Touch-screen entertainment screens were great but bring your own headphones. Entertainment selection was limited.,,,,,
"PX4 BNE-POM 29/12. Re-fitted 767. Don't know who designed and who signed off the new economy layout but there are serious flaws. 2 toilets only for the whole of economy and they are situated mid cabin. There is no void space around the toilets so any queue just forms in the aisles. There is a seat right by the door to the toilet so this poor passenger cops the door opening and closing all flight plus the odour. Would be a nightmare seat on an overnight flight. Why is the ""latest technology"" entertainment system not gate to gate. I've had is turned on anywhere between 5 and 25 mins after the seatbelt sign was switched off and then turned off at the started of decent - 30 mins out. Result -movie not finished. Service slow mechanical. Food quite good. New seats ok for short flight but would be uncomfortable on longer haul - too hard and seat base too short -no under thigh support.",,,,,
One of the worst airlines I have ever flown with. Of course you can not expect much in a country like Papua New Guinea. Overall I had six domestic flights all were delayed by at least one hour. All planes were in a disappointing condition. The cleanliness was poor the crew were rude incompetent and not very service oriented.,,,,,
MNL-POM-RAB return in Business. In the last five years flying with Air Niugini service and airplane quality has deteriorated dramatically. A flight inside PNG has become an absolute lottery game without help whatsoever from the ground crew.,,,,,
Flew Air Niugini from Cairns to Port Moresby on a Fokker F100. Departed on time fantastic food great crew.,,,,,
I have the misfortune of using Air Niugini often through lack of choice. Most recent flight was POM- SIN return. The airline is now leasing an aging White Airlines A310 which is older than the previous B767. Seats are appalling IFE does not work and toilets are constantly unservicable. The food is passable but really nothing special. Service is slow and Cabin crew seem unable to deal with complaints or concerns raised by passengers. Overall Air Niugini is not deserving of a three star ranking - a two star ranking would be more appropriate given the decline in the airline's international services.,,,,,
BNE to POM POM to Mt Hagen and return. Was very impressed with service. Cabin staff could not be faulted and very obliging and friendly.,,,,,
SIN-POM Busines Class. Check in at Singapore easy as we were early and able to take advantage of general early check in desk and also a separate Premium check-in area is available. Lounge at SIN is nice with a bit of food. Chaotic getting on plane with lot of pushing - we were sent down at a time when the Economy passengers were still queuing to go through security. Plane very hot and stuffy. Food edible - but you do not need 2 meals on an overnight 6 hour flight! Real problem are seats - the plane is a very tired leased 767 with seats that do not recline much and a poor foot-rest. They are the most uncomfortable seats I have experienced in either business class or economy for a long time. My husband could not sleep so put on his i-pod and was immediately told to turn it off as it was interfering with the radio. IFE did not work.,,,,,
I have been working in Port Moresby for two years and am a regular Air Niugini passenger. Have flown with them to Singapore Tokyo and numerous times to Brisbane. Primary long haul aircraft is still a hard working leased 767-300. Fokker F100 sometimes used on the Brisbane route. Cabin is a bit tired and lacks a good entertainment system. The service is Air Niugini's real plus - always a smile and flight attendants willing to go the extra mile. Fare competitiveness has improved significantly over the past few years with the introduction of competition from Airlines PNG on the Cairns and Brisbane routes. Qantas flights in/out of Port Moresby are codeshare with Air Niugini using Air Niugini aircraft.,,,,,
NRT-POM-BNE Business Class. It was a pleasant experience. FAs are efficient and friendly. I did not have much expectations for the IFE but was actually quite good. 3hour delay at Port Moresby but waiting at the executive lounge time went very quickly. Incidentally I never complain about delay when the airline company's priority is safety and paying extra attention to some fault even if its minor. I heard airliners in South Pacific region as well as Australia and NZ have very good safety record and I deeply appreciate and respect that.,,,,,
CNS-POM-CNS + domestic. The cabin crew are friendly and I would fly with them more if they expanded their route network. Fares are steep but then they have a monopoly on the PNG market. Aesthetic needs a bit of an upgrade as do most parts of the overall product (ie entertainment inflight magazine).,,,,,
The service is always good the food often served cold training required there - the delays are ongoing - why? Why can't we use upgrade certificates on the BNE-POM flight? The lounge in POM is late opening and often doesn't open before the 7am departure - people pay for this service.,,,,,
BNE/POM/MNL/POM/BNE in April 2004. First time with this line. As Mr Tate says the cabin crew are shy but very helpful and courteous. The cheap fare for the round trip (about $820) was the snare but I found them punctual efficient and the food (economy) quite good if a little light on in- flight reading matter.,,,,,
I would not hesitate to fly with Air Niugini Airlines again. I flew twice with them last year (2003) to Singapore and happened to have on board two of the same crew as my previous flight with them. They couldn't do enough for their passengers Qantas could take take a leaf out of their book. I no longer fly with Qantas as I find the staff always trying to avoid going that extra mile especially when it comes to night flights.,,,,,
BNE-POM-BNE Economy. service great flight was full food served promptly the IFE wasn't so good but Air NZ is too blame for that. Fare was cheap. The only thing is the Delays Air Niugini is delayed quite often but the crew are great when the flight has been delayed.,,,,,
"  We were totally amazed by their services, since none of us have ever heard of this airline. The trip was arranged by the travel agency who arranged our tour. Even during a short trip they provided us gourmet sandwiches and a warm cookie; while beverages was served twice, which is far much better than what we experienced from those larger airlines. How we wish they can cover more routes.",,,,,
"  Vancouver to Whitehorse. Air North is a wonderful friendly airline serving the Yukon. Their combination of an older fleet and genuine hospitality makes it the ideal way to get to Canada's beautiful Yukon. There is no IFE on board any of their aircraft which can be a downside for longer trips, but the food is all free and comes is greater quantity then the meal options you pay for on mainline carriers. Air North's flights are finished with a warm cookie service which is always enjoyable. Overall a great airline and great customer service!",,,,,
"Air North describes its class of service as ""Yukoner Economy"", which I thought probably referred to a concept of warm-hearted hospitality and generosity. This held true for my first flight in their 737-400, but after flying in the HS748 I'm wondering if the term is actually more about resilience in the face of harsh conditions! Cramped conditions in the HS748 aside, the service overall was pretty good - staff were (almost) all friendly and efficient, flights ran on schedule, and reasonable food was provided. No in-flight entertainment system, but at the time I flew, the stunning ever-changing landscape below was all the entertainment I could want.",,,,,
YVR-YXY in Economy. Check-in agents were quick and boarding commenced on time. On board the aircraft was old and not well maintained and in need of refurbishment. No inflight entertainment and seat pockets tray table and carpet were dirty. Inflight snacks mediocre. Seat was worn and not comfortable though the pitch seems to be pretty standard with Air Canada. Cabin crew announcements were rushed and inaudible. Service was the highlight and the crew were friendly. Flight arrived on-time and baggage was a short wait.,,,,,
"  Right now, Iberia Regional - Air Nostrum is serving the Madrid - Frankfurt route. I was very happy with their service and the quality of food, beverages in their Business Class. The service was quick and very attentive throughout the flight and even the coffee served was very fresh and tasty (which is usually not a strength of Iberia). Despite of this narrowbody aircraft, seating was comfortable and in Business Class, the seat besides you will be left empty. I can really recommend you this Business Class service on this route with Air Nostrum.",,,,,
" Madrid to Toulouse. Once again a punctual and comfortable flight. Good legroom, on time departure and arrival. On flight entertainment was however not working à you have to pay for anything on board",,,,,
"  Disappointed with Air Nostrum. Air Nostrum said that due to a change of aircraft, the CRJ 1000 instead of the ATR 72 was not fit to land at San Sebastian airport for technical reasons. How come a bigger aircraft like the A319 of Vueling can land in such airport? They diverted us to Pamplona. The flight was delayed more than 2 hours. Finally in Pamplona they took us in a bus to San Sebastian but instead of using the shortest route by motorway, the bus driver told us he was taking the longer route. I reached my destination almost 3 hours later than I was supposed to. ",,,,,
"  Casablanca to Madrid. The Check in for the flight was handled by Royal air Maroc staff, who were 20 mins late in opening check in due to an issue with a previous flight. It was a friday afternoon and only half of the immigration counters were open which resulted in an hour long wait to clear immigration. I wandered down to the boarding gate to wait for our flight. It was time to board but there was no aircraft at the gate. We were provided no infomation by Royal air Maroc ground staff about the flight or expected departure time 18.40. I discovered that the flight had not left Madrid. There was no food vouchers offered, no information provided regarding compensation for flight delays flights to the EU or details about the delay. The flight from Madrid arrived a little under three hours late. We were bussed to the aircraft which was parked some distance away despite having our boarding gate E1 free. The crew apologised for the delay and told us they had to swap an aircraft due to a technical issue. The CRJ 1000 has a narrow cabin and the seat was comfortable but a little tight. There were no complimentary drinks or snacks offered on board by the crew despite the long delay. After landing the aircraft taxied to a remote stand and we were bussed to the the Terminal (4S),. Our allocated baggage carousel was undergoing maintenance and the delivery of the bags was delayed by 15 mins. Overall a very unpleasant experience with Air Nostrum compounded by the poor communication. I arrived at my hotel over 4 hours late",,,,,
  I booked a return ticket with Air Nostrum and found out that I could travel a day earlier. When I tried to change the ticket the price quoted was twice the price of the ticket I had paid before. I decided to book one sector with another airline and wanted to cancel that sector. The price to not show up for a flight that i paid for was over 100 euro. I could not cancel otherwise and if I would be no show the return ticket will be cancelled. I learned my lesson and will not book tickets with this airline again.,,,,,
  Madrid to Granada. Excellent. Efficient and attentive cabin crew. Arrived and left on time. New aircraft and comfortable seats. Straightforward boarding and disembarking. Highly recommended.,,,,,
"  This flight was reserved weeks ahead of travel and was part of a journey to enable me to travel to London with a connection in Madrid. Firstly the website would not let me check-in online (although I had chosen my seat on the same website) when I reached the airport it transpired that my seat had been changed. I ended up at the very back of the flight by the lavatory. The flight was delayed and the lack of communication was a real concern, A group of Chinese passengers became anxious as they had a connecting flight and sadly the ground staff were rather rude and ignored them. Boarding did not follow the rules at all and was chaotic with a few passengers going back through the barrier to use the lavatory! The ground staff did not seem to care one iota. Incredibly passengers were allowed to take on far too much luggage. Once in Madrid a passenger realised he had left a bag behind at the airport in Seville the cabin crew member did not care less and shrugged her shoulders and pointed the man to the exit.",,,,,
"  Bologna to Madrid. The service of the leaves much to be desired, from the attention at the time of check-in to the punctuality that does not exist. One hour delay on the outward journey and two and a half hours on this return trip, of which an hour and a half were inside the cabin without any attention or explanation. The captain, already with all the people ready to leave, says that we were going to have to wait two hours to get out. ES: El servicio de la aerolíneas deja mucho que desear, desde la atención al momento del check-in a la puntualidad que no existe. Una hora de demora en el viaje de ida y dos horas y media en este viaje de regreso, de las cuales una hora y media fueron dentro de la cabina sin ninguna atención no mayor explicación. El comandante de a bordo, ya con todas las personas listas para partir dice que íbamos a tener que esperar dos horas para salir.. las compañías aéreas tienen todas las concesiones habidas y por haber mientras los clientes somos siempre rehenes.",,,,,
" Flew Air Nostrum from Madrid T4 to Ibiza. Nice short flight on a sunny afternoon. Fast drop-off baggage, a gentle Iberia staff member helped us to print boarding-passes, half-hour late boarding (walked to the plane). Comfortable seats, very kind cabin crew. Flight itself was great, splendid manned by a Lady-captain. So, we started our summer holiday relaxed. One week after, second leg, Ibiza to Valencia, 45 mins. flight on turboprop. Bit cramped seats, bit noisy, but for a such a short time wasn't important. Final approach was rather steep, but landing was OK. Both flight were on time (less than 15 mins. late arrival), uneventful, luggage claimed fast and in good situation, decent priced. I will not hesitate to use Air Nostrum for Spanish domestic flights in the future.",,,,,
"  Gatwick to Malaga via Madrid. I was flying in business class with Iberia from Gatwick to Madrid and with Air Nostrum from Madrid to Malaga. The first flight landed in Madrid with a delay and my connection to Malaga was a bit strict of time also because the first flight landed on a gate far from the boarding next flight gate. I managed to get on time on the second flight and, afraid for my luggage transfer on the second flight, I asked to the crew to verify if my luggage was on board. This verification I asked, was just because for the previous 3 flights in 2017 I had with the same route with them, my luggage went lost every time. The answer was that it was not in there duties so nothing to do about. Just because this question, I received a horrible treatment during the flight. Food was awful as the service, the plane was not clean and no complaint form was provided after my request. I will never fly again with Iberia and not with Air Nostrum as part of Iberia. Dirty aircraft, no customer service, also if in business class, no decent food. ",,,,,
"  Madrid to Lisbon. I feel very happy about my experience with Air Nostrum. The flight was cheap,  ground service was fast and helpful. The pilot and the crew were very kind. The seat was comfortable and the choice and quality of food and drinks was good and convenient.",,,,,
"  Porto to Madrid. A small aircraft and we were asked to check-in our hand luggage or to leave it by the aircraft and pick it up upon arrival. I find this irritating, as I had one piece of luggage, within the rules. Other people didn't. Those should be asked to do this. Besides this, staff were nice. Seating was OK.",,,,,
"  Alicante to Madrid. Uncoordinated ground staff who left 2 wheelchair users waiting without communication for over 30 minutes in a communal area. Check-in was laborious with one staff member conducting personal conversation rather than processing her passengers. Boarding was slow, very slow indeed! Two wheelchair users were left in a hot area without communication and were then boarded first. This was no problem other than other passengers being required to descend narrow stairs and wait for a  bus. The bus was very full and needed to make 2 journeys. Passengers were allowed to carry with them far too much luggage and this proved to be problematic in the extreme. Following departure the staff were poorly coordinated and communication was poor. Arrival was prompt but a bus was needed to negotiate a very large Madrid airport! Clearly, much needs to be done to improve matters. One would expect better from Air Nostrum.",,,,,
" IB8483 from Menorca to Palma operated by Air Nostrum. Boarding was on time and fast. The crew were friendly and their English was excellent. Apart from Spanish and English, there even was a shortened announcement in Catalan after boarding which I found very original. This was the first time this happened to me in the Catalan speaking regions of Spain. The aircraft wasn't very clean, there even was some chewing gum stuck to my window frame. For this short flight of about 35 minutes, snacks and drinks could be bought. The leg room was somewhat limited but for that short duration it was absolutely no problem at all.",,,,,
"  IB8496 from Palma to Menorca, operated by Air Nostrum. Boarding started with a significant delay of two hours but the ground crew were very conscious of that fact and tried to speed up the boarding process as good as possible. At boarding, the aircraft was baking hot. This bettered only a little during the flight but with the flight being just 30 minutes long, the temperature wasn't as big a deal as it would have been on a longer flight. The crew were friendly and talking to them in English was no problem at all. The aircraft was very clean. The leg room was a bit on the short side. There was no complimentary drink or meal service.",,,,,
"I flew from Madrid to Marseilles with Air Nostrum, everything was what I expect from flying on a short flight. I flew on a brand new CRJ1000. I liked the size of the plane, to the bigger A319. (operated by Air Nostrum's owner, Iberia). I also found the seats more comfortable than Iberia, more legroom and 2 by 2 layout rather than a three by three. Warning, If you are claustrophobic or don't like flying in small, regional jets, fly Iberia, or Iberia Express, but still very good and would choose them again.",,,,,
Flew Air Nostrum from Melilla to Madrid. Was a business flexible ticket. Quality / price excellent. Ground service in Melilla is nothing special for business flyers. Just a different row for check-in. The seat comfort for a short flight (less than 2 hours) was OK even though for a business class you could expect more. Breakfast is served for free for Business class giving two or three menus. I had fruit and it was very well served with yoghurt / cheese. The quality was excelent. I asked for kosher food and this wasn't given. They said they do not have kosher menu but suddenly on my way back they brought me kosher food. No entertainment on board. Bathroom without hand towel. Cabin staff very kind.,,,,,
"  Our direct SAS flight (to be operated by Cimber) from Vilnius to Copenhagen had been cancelled, so SAS re-routed us through Stockholm. The airlines between Vilnius and Stockholm turned out to be Air Nostrum. Seat pitch was the same as with SAS. Cabin staff did not speak any Scandinavian language nor Lithuanian, so announcements, including security instructions, were carried out in Spanish and English, and my wife and I didn't understand. Onboard we wanted to purchase some items, such as sparkling water and a sandwich. The purser then told that none of the goods from the menu card could be purchased. I thought that it was an SAS flight operated by another airline, and I actually expected SAS service. However, the only reaction to this was that they couldn't do anything, because this was Air Nostrum. I then argued that it said SAS on the ticket, and even the SAS logo was painted on the tail wing, but also this didn't seem to bother the purser at all. She said that all food/beverage services were only for business class. When my wife made it clear that if she actually did get sick during the flight, the cabin staff would have a problem, the purser got my wife sparkling water. ",,,,,
"Alicante to Madrid. Short flight to connect to a long haul flight. Ground staff were efficient at Iberia desk. As usual you have to leave larger carry on bags on the ground next to the plane and then pick them up on arrival next to the plane. Seats are leather and on a 2 by 2 basis in both business and economy. Service was adequate, leg room was adequate even for two over six footers.",,,,,
"I have flown on Air Nostrum for the first time on a quick 1hr 40min flight from T4 Madrid Barajas airport to Marrakesh airport. It was a smooth and well organised operation. I had not flown on a CRJ1000 and discovered it is a very pleasant and smooth aircraft with the value added of no middle seats as it is a 2-2 configuration. Interestingly enough it appears that this subsidiary of Iberia is able to carry out a better, friendlier service and have nicer uniforms than its parent company. The flight was good, service was good, the communication from the pilot and stewardesses was good. The only thing that was not good (not the airline's fault by the way) were the screeching children that some parents were unable (nor interested) to control, who managed to run riot around the plane and disturb pretty much everyone in the flight, to the point that one of the flight attendants had to go around with the youngest element and ask passengers who it belonged to shortly before landing as the parents were clearly not too interested in the safety of their own child.",,,,,
Alicante to Madrid with Air Nostrum was a very good short flight. Checked in a few days before on line and got emergency exit seats at no cost.,,,,,
Madrid to Bordeaux IB8554 March 4 2015. This would have to have been the worst service we have had on any airline! We are Platinum / Emerald frequent flyers. Plane was an hour late and pax were kept on bus with no explanation insufficient meals for the only 2 business class pax - us! Pancakes and only other meal not quite frozen! No welcome on board no welcome drink for business class pax us! No cabin assistance unless we asked repeatedly. And finally just to add insult no response to our original complaint about this and we have to fly with this airline again unfortunately. If we had a choice we would not fly Air Nostrum.,,,,,
MAH-PMI return on ATR72. Both flights on time crew good. Prices seem steep for non residents of the Islands. Used Iberia/BA airmiles so only paid tax.,,,,,
28th August 2013 I took a flight from Malaga to Melilla. I found the ground staff to be very professional and well turned out. They were welcoming and conducted their duties with pride. The flight was on an ATR aircraft which is ideal for the relatively short flight from Malaga to North Africa. The flight departed on-time and the cabin crew conducted a safety demonstration. Bizarrely one of the cabin crew showed the food to purchase card but then said there was nothing to buy! The flight was suitably comfortable and arrived into Melilla exactly as per schedule. Disembarkation was well managed and orderly. Overall I had a good impression of Air Nostrum. The tickets though seem expensive.,,,,,
Smooth way through the airport of Madrid. Check-in done online. The best way to do it nowadays. Even though Air Nostrum operates from the K area in Madrid this flight was boarded by bus which is ok. Very positive is the fact that you can deliver your hand-luggage next to the aircraft and thus not check it in or wait for it at a luggage belt. The stewardess was very friendly and well groomed. In general the cabin crews of Air Nostrum are young and good looking. The old CRJ200 was noisy and small not my favourite regional aircraft. The flight was short and uneventful. The inflight service consisted of 'tu menu' which is in your seat pocket and from which you can buy 'Iberia' style snacks and drinks. Not too long ago this carrier still offered free of charge beverages and even snacks and sandwiches.,,,,,
Just learnt from an online check-in that my flight tomorrow from BCN to NCE was cancelled without them notifying me. They were not at all interested nor apologetic when I phoned for an explanation. I paid more to travel with them over the cheaper alternatives to avoid this situation. Such a short flight but it has cost me over 2K so far in re-routing around their failure. An email from them could have avoided so much trouble.,,,,,
MAN-MAD-MAN on a newish CRJ900. Business takes me to Madrid a lot and this new route replaces the stop at LHR and shaves 4 hours off the journey for me. Friendly efficient clean with nothing to grumble about.,,,,,
MAD-MUC on a newer CRJ-1000. As opposed to our terrible experience on Iberia for the earlier legs of this trip this was a night-and-day difference. Clean modern plane with legroom efficient FA's drinks and snacks served. Air Nostrum does everything so much better than its parent. If you are compelled to take Iberia flights make sure you use Air Nostrum for as many legs as you can - it really is a superior experience.,,,,,
Madrid to Porto. A relatively modern CRJ1000 (2+2 seating) offered more legroom than Iberia A320. Flight almost an hour late but this is becoming the norm at Madrid-Barajas so it's not a big deal. Crew pleasant and served drinks and a small packet of nuts on 1 hour flight.,,,,,
Madrid to San Sebastian on Canadair RJ 200. Just four business class seats on this 35 minute short-haul regional flight. Very friendly and attentive service with free drinks and filled rolls for business. Oversize hand luggage was put in the hold and could be collected on the tarmac at the destination. You wouldn't really pay for business on this regional airline as it's not really value for money for such short hops. But if you happen to travel in this class then it's very pleasant.,,,,,
Madrid-Murcia return. I've had a few flights with Air Nostrum now and find their flights reasonably enjoyable. Service pleasant and friendly from the FA (coffee served) and flights seem to leave on time. I was very impressed with my check-in at Murcia's small terminal and which involved ticketing right through to Tokyo using Iberia and Japan Airlines connections and the whole process was seamless and efficient. I'm not sure if I like travelling in CRJ 200s that Air Nostrum uses but that may be because on Air Nostrum at least I never seem to be able to get clean windows and am unable to see outside much at all. Do these aircraft ever get cleaned?,,,,,
MAD-NTE-MAD. We were bussed to the aircraft and boarded very efficiently. The only FA spoke perfect English and Spanish and broken French. CRJ200 series (50 seats) was clean. FA was very friendly. We were served a drink and a packet of nuts and then biscuits and another drink. FA also gave out activity books to kids and newspapers and magazines to passengers as required. Air Nostrum did very well considering Iberia's service.,,,,,
MAD-VAL-MAD. A very satisfactory flying experience with flights leaving on time. Nice comfortable leather seats well turned out and friendly cabin crew who saw to the needs of my grandson by providing a colouring book and pencils. Light refreshments and newspapers were also provided. A pleasant change from flying budget airlines.,,,,,
Porto-Madrid business class. Ridiculously small space in Business class the same very narrow space as in economy. There are just 8 business class seats but if full as in my case it is no joy at all and the service is poor too. The flight left in time it was short so endurable. On arrival in Madrid the luggage was off-loaded right beside the aircraft and we had to take it from there ourselves.,,,,,
Gran Canaria - Valencia return. Checked in online in both directions and only had to drop my luggage at the counter. Almost full CRJ 200 and must admit that it was a pleasure to fly with this airline. Comfortable leather seats emergency exit seat so plenty of legroom for a 6'4'' passenger like me (also noticed that the other rows of seats also had above average space) although the seats were a bit narrow due to the width of the plane rather than Air Nostrum seating. The two flight attendants were cheerful and helpful: a sandwich and beer was provided (more than adequate for the time of day and length of flight (2h30m). Infinitely better flight than Iberia via Madrid Air Nostrum will be my airlibne of preference for domestic flights in Spain.,,,,,
NCE to MAD on a full CRJ-900. Flight left on time even though the plane had two busloads to fill it up. Service not extraordinary. Hostesses served us drinks and cheese sandwiches flight landed on time even though took 30 minutes in order to stop to gate. Good airline worth the price (250 euros return booked 1 month in advance) but do not expect a great service.,,,,,
VLC-TFN. El avión impecable el servicio a bordo adecuado al tamaño del avion (bocadillos mini y refresco) coste economico y puntual. Este verano repito. Clean airplane the service on board adapted to the size of the airplane (mini sandwiches and refreshment) all at a very good price. This summer I will travel Air Nostrum again.,,,,,
I have travelled on Air Nostrum a couple of times and find their service very good. I find it more relaxing than travelling on other airlines. Food consists of a sandwich or cake.,,,,,
MAD-VLC-MAD in economy. MAD-VLC on Air Nostrum and VLC-MAD on Iberia. Maybe I was lucky but the experience was quite good. The flights both ways were on time and without any unpleasant incident. Connecting from Air Canada (Terminal 1 in Madrid) to Iberia (Terminal 4) was a bit of a trial. It took a good 15 minutes on the shuttle bus much of it on the highway. Air Nostrum used a Bombardier CRJ a bit tight for space. Service on this 50 minute flight exceeded my expectations. No inflight entertainment - none was expected of course given the small plane and short flight. The two FA managed to serve drinks and miniature sandwiches (an almost microscopic bun with a single slice of chorizo inside) although they had to rush to get it done. I was in the last row and the descent to Valencia airport was choppy - felt like a life raft in rough sea! Anyway service was pleasant and I give Air Nostrum full marks. On my return leg on an Iberia Airbus 320 the experience was also quite good although below Air Nostrum. FAs did their job and were reasonably pleasant. Clean plane with 3+3 configuration leather seats with lots of leg room. The flight was only half full and left about 15 minutes late but got to Madrid on time. The downside was absolutely no drinks or snacks of any kind except in business class. There was food for purchase but I didn't see a single person purchasing. No IFE or video demonstration of any kind. I had only carry-on so can't comment on baggage handling. Overall a good experience I would give Air Nostrum 4 star and Iberia 3 star.,,,,,
MAD-TOU-MAD on CRJ 900. The flight attendants provided a very good service. Even though the flight only lasted 50 minutes they did their very best on this time. The only bad thing was the announcements the flight attendant who was in charge didn´t spoke french. Maybe in flights that go to France they should speak a bit of French.,,,,,
FRA-ZAR-FRA economy on Air Nostrum for Iberia in mid-June. I was disappointed. The all-economy seating when booking had been altered to mixed configuration business and economy by departure date and the economy passengers seemed to get much poorer service and food than the one or two passengers in the little business class cabin. FAs on all flights also seemed to have a bad case of attitude. Maybe I was having a bad hair day but I found the service poor the flights noisy (in the CRJs) the windows almost impossible to see out of. So I was happy to finally land in Zaragoza and Frankfurt.,,,,,
MAD-NCE-MAD on Canadair CRJ900 a superb aircraft. It is in a completely different league than the parent company Iberia. A sandwich two small bottles of wine and a coffee on a 1hr 20 run served by friendly professional flight attendants. This is one very good airline and if you dont have to connect onwards onto an IB connection you will enjoy the experience.,,,,,
Tangiers-Barcelona on a Canadair operated by Air Nostrum - way better than Iberia its higher class and service is also better than Iberia. The whole plane was business class.,,,,,
Basel via Barcelona to Granada. The flights between Basel and Barcelona were operated by Air Nostrum although sadly since they've stopped flying to Basel. I think their service is nothing short of amazing. First of all on the return we were even given a hot meal. This was in economy class and the flight is less than two hours. Generally the quality of the food is good and the service in economy class is more like what you get in Business class on most airlines. The flight attendants were very friendly which only made the contrast to the surly unfriendly bunch working for Iberia seem even more unfriendly.,,,,,
"  Horrible. This woman at security decided to make up her own TSA rules and took all of my souvenirs that the locals when purchasing assured me they would make it through security. Tiny hot sauce in plastic 2 Oz bottles. Anything glass that was empty. Cocoa farm souvenirs from green acres. Confiscated. Meanwhile, my multi purpose utility metal chingadera with a serrated edge was ok. Perfume in glass ok. Tiny hot sauce in glass not ok. I’ve traveled over 20 countries without issue with same items. Also tiny school backpack forced to check. Never do I have to check. While some passengers brought 2 to 3 times bigger bags on without checking. This agent ruined my otherwise pleasant experience in bocas. Don’t buy anything over there that’s not made of wood basically. Hate you Air Panama. I’ve included photos of huge bags twice the size of mine allowed on plane. Pat yourself on the back because you lost a return customer and did not make the flight any safer. Might sound petty but just left me with a bad experience that unfortunately overshadowed my good time.",,,,,
"  Ground staff friendly and professional. Limited facilities at Albrook Airport but functional. Couldn't do online check in but was smooth at the airport. Older plane but was on time and smooth flight. No real on board service so take your own snack or drink after airport security. Flight was only 50mins so not a problem. Plane does have a toilet. It's not like flying a major international airline, but its a short flight and was a good experience. They even gave us umbrellas to walk to the plane as it had started to rain which was a nice touch. I'd seen other negative reviews so was pleasantly surprised how professional and polite their staff were. I'd use them again. It's difficult to rate the actual on board service because there really isn't any, no entertainment or food / drinks but it's such a short flight it's not that relevant. So I base my score on the overall experience. Good service and on time flights with friendly staff but in flight service not really offered.",,,,,
 The plane was in a good condition even for an old plane. Both flights were on time. On the 50 minute flight there was no service. Staff of the airline were professional and quick at check in. No e-check in.,,,,,
"  The worst airline I have ever been in my life and I travel 2-3 times a year on international airlines. This airline has excessive prices since it does not have much competition, internal flights in Panama have a similar cost to an international flight to the United States. Also their prices are excessive, they have a no reimbursement policy and if you get sick with COVID or some other disease and you cannot travel, they will not reimburse you a penny. I would never recommend such an airline. ",,,,,
  Panama City to Bocas Del Toro. Arrived at the airport an hour before my flight to find out I was switched to a different flight two hours after my scheduled flight. They told me I was informed by email which was a lie. The Air Panama staff acted annoyed and placed me on an imaginary waitlist by literally writing me last name down on a blank piece of paper and told me to keep checking and of course there was no room on any earlier flight every time I checked. I recommend using Copa or really any other airline if possible. I am finally boarding my plane after three hours and I will update if more things go wrong!,,,,,
"  Panama City to Bocas del Torro. After reading reviews i was not looking forward to flying Air Panama. But the experience i had with them on the day of the flight was nothing as to what has been written. Check-in was fast, there is no online checking available as far as i could find. The plane was an old Fokker 50. Boarding was fast, we had to walk from the terminal to the plane. Once in the plane you could see the age (and there was a nasty smell onboard). We departed 15 minutes early. The seats were comfortable and plenty of legspace. It was a 40 minute flight, a drink and snack were served by 2 friendly flight attendants. Air Panama get the job done and I didn't have horrible service described by other people. It was fast and efficient nothing more and nothing less, maybe an upgrade in their fleet could do magic for them.y.",,,,,
" 
Albrook (Panama City) to Bocas del Toro. After reading comments about this airline I was a bit worried but our flight with Air Panama was really okay. Checkin at the airport was quick, there were no lines. My bag was 17 kg so I had to pay 9 dollars for the 3 kg overweight. Totally fine. There are no infoscreens at the small airport of Albrook but as there are only leaving a couple of flights a day its obvious when boarding starts. The flight left at 2.30, so right on time. The fokker 50 used for this flight is old but seatpitch was okay for this 55 minute flight to Bocas. After a loud and bumpy take off the crew handed out some crisps and a soda. After 35 minutes of cruising with some wonderful views at the rainforest and Caribbean beaches, the pilot started decent into Bocas airport. After a soft landing and a short taxi to the small apron our luggage appeared within minutes. We really enjoyed this flight in this old air Panama fokker-airplane.",,,,,
"  Panama City to David. This airline is terrible. They made my 5lbs Yorkie go in the luggage area. They wanted me to buy one of their containers. At security they took my tweeter and very small scissors. Mind you, I traveled with my pet in cabin and these 2 items from USA to Costa Rica and Costa Rica to Panama, but in a domestic flight from Albrook to David it wasn’t allowed. ",,,,,
"  Panama City to David. Pleasant flight experience on an old Fokker 100. A little expensive for what you get, but there's little competition in Panama. Seats were comfortable & spacious, though the interior of the plane had not seen an update since the late 1980s or early 1990s. Cabin crew were friendly and served soft drinks (including diet options) and plantain chips. Flight departed and arrived about 20min late.",,,,,
"  Panama City to Bocas del Toro. This is back to the 70s. Absolutely the worst airline I ever flew. We came to the airport and they told us the flight is moved to 5 pm and the return is cancelled too and we can only take the next one at 10am. It meant we will never reach our flight to Colòmbia as it was 2hrs later. No one to talk to,. After screaming we got a letter saying that they deleted 2 flights and because of that we are stuck. Sadly Copa Air didn't care about the letter and we had to pay a penalty. We will pursue with them when we are back home. But if I gave them, their check-in, their fleet and their attitude a score it would be absolute zero.",,,,,
"  
Bocas del Toro to Panama City. Our Air Panama flight just got canceled, because they could combine two flights in one. No heads up in advance, just the message when we arrived at the checkin desk. We had to wait for 3 ours so they can get a higher profit, no compensation what so ever, not even a drink. Worst airline ever! I have to give a rating of one because a zero wasn’t allowed",,,,,
"  Worst Airline ever. We flew from Panama City to Bocas and back to Panama City and had a 2,5 hour delay each way. The bad thing about that is not the delay itself but the lack of communication. As there are no displays at the airport we had to ask every 10 min when we will proceed or what the current problem is. The staff first didn't say anything and dissappeared to the back office. A half hour later it was said that the airplane has a ""preventative maintenance"" - how can you have a planned maintenance when the plane should be in the air? Overall it was a lie, as our plane arrived two hours later with passengers on board. The planes are very old with a ""museum smell"" in the cabin. Now we are on our way back from Bocas to Panama City and have a 2,5 hour delay again. This was communicated 10 min before boarding... let's see when and if we arrive. If you can avoid it, never fly Air Panama.",,,,,
"  This airline has a really problem and seriously I have no idea how this company is still working. Firstly, the tickets were not cheap for a ""low cost airline"" with very bad conditions airplanes (I don't know which type of model is, but looks likes second hand airplane.  We paid for the round trip 487USD. The flight was suppose that should be depart at 9:00 am arriving to Bocas del Toro at 10:00 am, at the end we depart around 2:30 pm and we were really angry because we lost our tours and our plans for that day. We didn't receive any explanation for the delay. We asked for a reimbursement, because in Europe if the airline has a delay of three hour you receive a percentage of your money back. In this case, we had a delay of five hour, and when we talked to the customer service, she told us that the airline doesn't has any politic regarding to the reimbursement of money for delays. Seriously! you have to be kidding me - then she told us that the only thing that the airline can give us is the lunch for free, and I answered her that we didn't receive any ""lunch for free"" instead they gave us snacks as potatoes chips, plantain chips, cokes, and rum - for me been diabetic that is not food! I was literally starving because in addition the airport is really small and the facilities are lacking of restaurants, so you can not buy food there. The airport just have two small coffee shops and one small kiosk and they not offer you food either. The customer service was really bad in my opinion because we were asking and asking what was happening without an a proper answer. When you buy the ticket through the website you don't have any option that talk about the insurance of reimbursement in case of delays and this is fault of Panamanian authorities, and they should fix this immediately. In summary. I don't recommend this airline neither the airport facilities.

"A short domestic return flight from Marcos A Gelabert to Bocas Del Toro with Air Panama, on an ancient Fokker 50. The interior looked really tired and on the return trip there was a bad smell in the cabin. On the way out, really friendly and smiling FA's, less smiles on the return. A snack and a drink (even local Abuelo rhum) were served free of charge. Both flights on time.",,,,,
" Overall the airline offered a clean cabin, efficient crew (almost friendly), good seat spacing and on-time service. Pretty good for a budget airline.",,,,,
 Air Pegasus cancelled my flight two times and I was forced to change my travel date at last minute. I booked flight OP103 BLR-TRV departing 18:30. Few weeks before the departure date they informed me that they are cancelling the flight due to operational reasons. So they modified my booking and provided seats in OP101 BLR-TRV departing at 06:30. The evening before the departure they cancelled OP101 stating operational reasons. I called their customer care number. I could not speak to anyone until 21:30. When I asked them for alternate arrangement they said they dont have any flights and asked me to reschedule my trip for 1 day later. They refused to provide a seat in other airlines. Only option they gave were to cancel the booking or to fly at the later date. The last minute fares were so high that I could not afford to cancel and book on another airline. So I was forced to change my travel date. This is a very common practice of Air Pegasus. There are many issues related to last minute cancellation reported by passengers. Beware of Air Pegasus. Anytime they can cancel the flights stating operational reasons.,,,,,
"  Chennai to Madurai with Air Pegasus. Worst customer service and experience. The flight was canceled at last minute after reaching airport in the name of technical failure. When enquirying about some back up plan and penalty, I experienced the worst customer service. ",,,,,
"Amazing team at Hubli airport. We had to change the plane in Bangalore to get to Kochi and we might be late, however the team assured us that our baggage will go first from plane, when we have landed. Us and few other people in similar situation were brought by small bus faster than other customer to the airport and one guy from airport in Bangalore from Air Pegasus made sure and check our flights details that we will be on time. Thank you one more time especially for team in Hubli! Amazing customer service. ",,,,,

The flight with Air Rarotonga was a pleasurable experience: spotless clean aircraft with much space for legs, an excellent and friendly service, coffee was served on that short flight on the small plane and even the small airline's brochure and a daily newspaper was offered to read by passengers. I was impressed by the overall quality of the service.",,,,,
"  My partner and I recently flew from Rarotonga to Aitutaki. The flights are 40 minutes each direction. Well, what a professional airline. A full service was conducted with complimentary tea/coffee/water. Buy on board items offered. Cookies were $2.00 and value for money. The only flight attendant was professional and courteous. the aircraft was immaculate. Seat space rivals some international airline's premium economy offerings. These flights were very pleasant. This airline is a great ambassador for this idyllic part of the world.",,,,,
"  Terrible experience, they lost my 2 luggages. Customer service total disaster, lack of professionalism, is very hard to get in touch with them and if you do them answer is ""we don't know"".  I just transit Bulgaria to visit the country, now I am stuck here and I lost all my reservations for my next trip with no clothes for change. So please be careful and don't choose this airline.",,,,,
"  My daughter who is 17 years old, and disabled had her flight scheduled from Belgrade to London this morning. She was provided her boarding pass, and she checked in her luggage . While waiting in the line to board the plane, her name was called, and Air Serbia staffer told her that her seat was sold to another passenger? Staff was very rude and did not help her at all. She was never provided with new flight times, or given an explanation on how she will get home to America ? She has 4 days of chemo therapy left with her , and needed to come home ASAP. She was crying so hard, and not one staff member wanted to help her. So here I am today trying to contact the agency that sold us tickets to arrange for new flight as she lost her connecting flight from London to America. ",,,,,
"  Worst airline ever! They lost our luggage in Belgrade and it is impossible to reach anybody. We called 20 different numbers all day and no one ever picks up the phone. We knew someone in Belgrade who went to the airport and even that was useless. Nobody had a clue, and nobody cared. Everybody was rude and aggressive. It is complete chaos, this company is going down the drain. Avoid them at all cost. Avoid also Belgrade airport as a stop over, the ground operations are totally disorganised. ",,,,,
  Worst airline. Our flight from Athens to Belgrade with air Serbia was delayed 2 hours. Missed our connecting flight from Belgrade to Budapest by 15 minutes. Had to wait 5hrs at the airport until we got a voucher for a hotel (this was at 11pm). Once we got our vouchers we were told to wait again for a bus. Staff were rude and not helpful at all. We understand that it is no fault of their own but an apology would be nice. Although the lady that did rebook our flights was nice enough. I will never book with this airline again.,,,,,
"  Air Serbia is not a functional airline in terms of lost luggage and customer service care, they are too far from taking care of their customers. They lost our luggage in connecting flight, and there is no phone number to call checking your lost luggage. There is a tracing luggage site which hives you permanently statement, ""Tracing continue, check your status later"" All our clothes is lost and we are stuck here with no clothes on our vacation. In Tivat airport is extremely low technical and computer equipped airport, no real serviced of lost luggage claim. ",,,,,
" Horrible experience! During my connection from Lyon to Tirana on June 30th, my luggage has been lost like a thousand ones. I have been travelling for 10 days in Albania without any belongings. I was obliged to buy minimal stuff just to be clean and try to enjoy my trip. I have tried to contact tens of times Lost & found offices in Tirana and Belgrade by phone, by email without any luck nor information. Now I have been back in France for 6 days and I still don't have any news.",,,,,
"  Booked a flight from Bucharest to Barcelona via Belgrade and return as to avoid the low cost carriers. The first flight from Bucharest to Belgrade arrived late and departed with 2 hours delay. The flight from Belgrade to Barcelona was still at the gate but the staff bluntly told us that we missed our flight and we must contact the carrier for a new flight. The 2 luggage's were not presented at the luggage belt, we waited for 2 hours as mountains of luggage were pilled all over the place. In our condition were more than 200 passengers all stranded in Belgrade. They booked us to the next flight in the morning and lied that the baggage will come along in the new flight. They didn't and they are after 2.5 weeks not found! We had to sleep in the airport as no hotel was provided in time. The return flight had also 3 2+ hours delay and should have to arrive in Belgrade past our connection to Bucharest. As we arrived in Belgrade the connection flight was still there with no boarding started. As in Barcelona we received only the boarding passes to Belgrade, they instructed us to go to the transit desk and receive our passes. After 2+ hours we didn't received our passes and the plane flew without us. The staff are impolite and lie all the time or routing you to the next incompetent person. They failed on every service offered and do not respond to emails. Will never fly again this company or Etihad for having such partners and avoid all stops in Belgrade.",,,,,
" I wanted to change the date on my business class travel to Oslo. I called and they told me it's not possible, but they will give me full refund. They asked me to fill the bank information where I want my money. I never received nothing. Either they no longer respond to my emails. The telephone number for customer service it seems unreachable or thy just blocked me just like that. I have tried like 40 times to call them",,,,,
"  Not a single flight has been on time. Always a minimum 1hr delay. Bags were lost, returned after many days, nightmare when on holiday. ",,,,,
" I received an email on the 3rd of July from Air Serbia informing me that my scheduled flight which was on the 6th of July at 20:35 was rescheduled 9 hours earlier than the initial time. I have emailed the company and called several times but I had no response. The company did not offer me a refund or compensation, in order to buy another ticket. I had no other choice but to take the changed flight the company decided for me. In result, I had to cancel my arranged work scheduled meetings in Karlovy Vary. Moreover this morning my flight was meant to depart at 09:35 from Prague, but they were delayed and made us go through unnecessary waiting in the bus. When we finally arrived in Larnaca a while ago, my partner’s luggage (along with several other luggage from passengers in the plane) never arrived to Cyprus, because they were forgotten behind in Belgrade. This is by far the worst airline I’ve travelled with.",,,,,
  There was overbooking for about 8 passengers on my flight. The next scheduled flight I was offered is after twelve hours at late night. No reaction on my complaint for months since this time.,,,,,
  This is the worst company I ever used. The first plane was late and we still arrived on time for a second plane but they didn't let us in even if the plane was still here and not closed. Then we waited 2 hours to get tickets for the morning after where the crew arrived after the supposed departure time and we had more than 1h delay. Worst company ever and worst sales teams. This is not a professional company and it should not sell ticket if they are not able to fly on time.,,,,,
" Delayed flights, lost luggage. and when they located it, they said I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE AIRPORT TO PICK IT UP!! They don't even send it. NEVER AGAIN!",,,,,
"  Worst airline ever. They lie about special offers. They delayed our return flight for 24h and we got just some generic message. No explanation, nothing. They left us with our 3 year old child and when we complained that we don't have any more accommodation they didn't care. Never again with them.",,,,,
"  Plane arrived in Rome one hour late because of a delay in getting fuel to the aircraft. It sat at the gate for over an hour until the petroleum truck arrived. Very little, if any, communication from the less than helpful gate staff to the passengers regarding status or reason. Mostly, they did not face the terminal and even disappeared or hid behind the desk. Pilot neither acknowledged nor apologized for the delay. The digital display board was never updated to show the delay. Boarding pass had 4 zones for boarding which were absolutely unenforced except they allowed families with children & disabled on first. They couldn’t even complete the a la carte food service for economy passengers. 4.Electronics must be turned off for takeoff & landing? Also a notice that you can’t take photos of other passengers. No WiFi on planes.",,,,,
"  The panel above passenger's head was broken and 'fixed' with tape. Cabin crew are very young female staff, who were assertive, arrogant and aggressive.",,,,,
"  This is the worst airline ever, only with this airline I had such a terrible experience. I purchased my ticket on an official Air Serbia website and paid extra for the seat which is displayed on the attached ticket (3A). The boarding starts, and they start from the last row going forward. So I board among the last, and at the boarding they said they changed my seat from 3A to 30C which is the last row of the plane near the bathroom. They don’t even know the reason, that’s how good that are. My advice to everyone - don’t fly with Air Serbia- no customer service at all. And if you fly - don’t pay extra for any of their services, since as it turns out nothing what you paid for is guaranteed.",,,,,
  They lost my luggage. They are giving me no updates. Cannot reach out to them in anyway. Also very rude staff very unprofessional. I absolutely do not recommend.,,,,,
"  Full plane, the stewardesses were efficient, professional. They serve passengers a complimentary meal on a 3:30 flight which  is commendable. Spacious on emergency exit. Also bought a bigger chicken sandwich for 4.5 €, think it was worthwile on European flight.",,,,,
  I can't give a full score because there was a 45 minute delay. The flight was operated by another company called Air Connect and its crew was pleasant and the plane clean and modern.,,,,,
"  Due to bad weather in New York at least 30 passengers got delayed. Air Serbia did not find appropriate to have their desk opened at least 15 minutes later to allow us all to board the plane. Worst of all we printed their boarding passes at home and when we showed them to security at JFK they were not valid, what a joke. Never again. So many nice airlines around and I am trying to use Air Serbia just from patriotic reasons. They do not deserve to even consider them as an option.",,,,,
"  The worst airline ever. 3 hours delayed flight without any update information, no information at the airport about flight status. Call center barely reached, but I’ve been charged 10k isk for a call, with waiting over an hour! In addition agent who I’ve talked with was so rude and unpleasant! Shame for Serbia, never again fly with Air Serbia.",,,,,
  You have to wait at least 40 to 50mins to communicate with Air Serbia. And when you are lucky and that happens you can't communicate unless you speak Serbian. They don't speak English at all. Their tickets are not changed even with a fee. ,,,,,
"  I paid for 2 extra suitcases online and was charged again at the airport. My mum has been trying to get the money back for the past 2 weeks. No email has been responded to, she spend 30 EUR on calls just to be told you will receive an email and the refund. Nothing  happened.",,,,,
"  We bought two tickets to fly from Tirana to Stockholm, via Belgrade, the 15th October 2022, with Air Serbia. The flight number was JU217 and its departure was at 4:30 am. The flight was cancelled and nobody noticed us, we first knew about the cancellation when we arrived at the airport. Air Serbia didn't provide us an alternative flight, a hotel or meal: they just said that the next flight would be 37 hours later. Anyhow the guy there only mention that flight, never ask us if we wanted to take that. We couldn't anyhow have waited that much because we had another flight the same day from Stockholm to Buenos Aires. So, we bought immediately another flight at Lufthansa, which did departed at 8:30. I asked for a refund from the company but the company answered that the flight was cancelled because of weather conditions, but Air Serbia was the only company which cancelled the flight.",,,,,
  I made an offer to upgrade to business but received no email to inform me if my bid was successful or not. When I checked in it was confirmed my bid was not successful but I was given an emergency exit seat which is good. The flight was 2 hours and 20 minutes late and when I boarded I realised the plane was a type that has no business class at all. In my opinion there were too few bids for upgrade to business class so the airline decided to switch the plane to one without a business class despite it arriving two hours or so later. The plane itself was clean and onboard service was good.,,,,,
  I will never use this company again. I already gave them a free money for deciding to stay one more day and purchased another ticket for later day. They charged me for a tiny carry on $60 for being 2kg over. I wanted to take off some staff but the girl was rude and forced me to pay. I did not want to argue and paid. I am pretty sure karma will take care of that stewardess and the air company. I did lot recommend them to fly with them. They billed me almost $200 for 1 hour flight.,,,,,
"  In August we had a flight returning from Belgrade to JFK two out of three of my luggage arrived at JFK we filed a claim for the lost luggage. It’s almost 3 months later and there’s no luggage and there’s no response. You get an automated email response from them you cannot get a hold of a human, they basically ignore everything, they don’t want to take responsibility. I will never recommend them and I will never use them again.",,,,,
"  Excessive delay of my baggage (>30 days). I went through the whole process and claims for my luggage in the airport, as well as in the airline's website. I have been trying to contact the airline ever since this incident happened and no one has responded to my phone calls, the customer base even hung up the phone multiple times after being on hold for more than 2. I have sent several emails and submitted tens of complaint forms and the airline seems to ignore everything. ",,,,,
"  Vienna to Belgrade. Never fly with Air Serbia, even if they give you free ticket. We flew to Belgrade on Air Serbia flight JU601 on Sep 11. Flight attendants looked as if they had number of sleepless nights prior to this flight. Tired, stern, no smiles. Extremely cold air blew onto us. There was no way for us to adjust the flow. when I asked if something can be done, I just got unpleasant stare, and not a single word. Still have pain in my ear after two days. Upon arrival, we realized that our bags were missing. Filed a claim immediately. Staff at the Baggage claim were unprofessional and disorganized. The following was the answer to my question about contacting someone at the call center number provided on the claim form : “You can try, but nobody has answered on that line in the last several months’. How is this possible? Yes, it is. After two days of trying, we are still to hear someone answer. We sent many emails as well, no replies, no acknowledgment. Went back to the airport morning of Sep 13, were informed that one of our bags will arrive on the evening flight from Vienna, JU605. Went to the airport again in the evening. We were told that our bag was probably not loaded onto flight. Probably? What does that mean? The baggage hall was full of delayed bags It looked very chaotic. We are losing hope that our bags will ever be found. In the chaos that is Belgrade airport is, anyone’s bag can easily be stolen. If you have any respect for yourself, for your time and money, do not fly on Air Serbia!",,,,,
" Bought a refundable ticket. Tried to get a refund for this ticket after my plans were changed. I was not even rejected for the refund with an excuse, I was completely ignored on all communication channels. Don't know what more to say. I had generally positive experiences with the company previously but this negates it all. Absolutely avoid.",,,,,
"  Belgrade to New York. Had a return flight August 13 with my son from Belgrade to New York JFK. Upon arriving at JFK we waited what felt like forever for our luggage, unfortunately for me two of our luggage did not arrive, we filed a claim at JFK, I have yet to hear from anyone either from JFK or Air Serbia it’s 2 1/2 weeks later and I have no luggage nor have I heard back from anyone. I have sent hundreds and hundreds of emails to Air Serbia I’ve called the hundreds and hundreds of times however you cannot get a hold of anyone even if you wait an hour it automatically hangs up. Re: Air Serbia I find the airline extremely unprofessional, unorganized and clearly understaffed, because I can’t get a hold of anyone via email via phone any which way.",,,,,
  When we were leaving Serbia they delayed our flight. I asked information desk and they said they had no information about the flight. I asked a person at the gate and she told me the plane was here and there were no issues. So after waiting we asked information and they said the plane was in the air and expected to arrive soon. So after waiting some more we asked information again and they said the plane was stuck in Turkey because of bad weather. I checked the weather radar in Turkey and there was no cloud over Turkey. The customers were getting irritated and the information lady said if anyone else asked that she would call the cops on everyone in line. Customer service does not exist in Air Serbia. ,,,,,
"  Their plane from Sochi to Belgrade was delayed (JU679 of Aug 8th, 2022) I couldn't catch a connection to Bologna because it was already gone (JU550 of Aug 8th, 2022) I was given another itinerary by their representative in Belgrade through Split and Vienna Their plane (JU252) to Split was delayed, I couldn't catch my connection to Vienna and then to Bologna I was left with no assistance at the Split airport, I tried to contact them by phone but nobody answered The day after I took a bus to Bologna at my own expense, not to mention that I had to sleep in the open air and I had to buy food for that day. I asked for a refund right away filling in all of their forms and after several days a machine is telling me that it will take time to peruse my request.",,,,,
"  The flight from Sarajevo to Zürich, over Belgrade (20.08.2022) was cancelled while we were in the taxi driving to the airport. There is no Air Serbia support on the airport. Airport Sarajevo stuff sent us to the hotel and we got phone number of Air Serbia support for Bosnia to deal with the new tickets. But it is impossible to get anyone on that phone number. We spent all mobile phone credit by waiting on the line. An hour later we just got a new tickets for 2 days later, without a chance to comment. No other option is offered. Meanwhile hotel is booked by the airport for only one night. We wrote to all publicly given addresses trying to reach out to someone in Air Serbia. All without success. So, basically, they are canceling the flight without telling the reason, sending new ticket without asking whether those 2 days make a difference in your life, without ensuring accomodation over a whole forced stay.  Also flight to Sarajevo didn't go without troubles. Connecting flight was 4 hours delayed. Nobody explained why or apologized. We went to the service desk at the airport where we got sandwiches and bottle of water as compensation. When we finally got to the plane, my seat as well as seats of several people around were broken. I had to hold recliner by hand. ",,,,,
" Airplane was delayed for 4 hours, but first two hours nobody would announce anything and give some info why and for how long plane will be delayed. Then finally after more waiting we sat on the plane, while driving to the runway the pilot suddenly said there was an engine issue and we have to go back. We were sitting in 36 C degrees on the plane when finally they said we can go to the bus and sit with a/c. Plane was small and announcement was very loud (I am kind of deaf - but it was too loud for me). Crew were more making a joke about the situation than really trying to help and inform passengers. A plus was that they gave us a snack but everybody got different. I think some got aa toasted sandwich, but some got a small bottle of water, some candy etc. Apparently whatever was left from the previous flight.",,,,,
  Round ticket booked through Air Serbia in collaboration with Tarom. Since Tarom is an unique airline that includes their checked in bags(23kg) fees in the ticket price I only had to pay the extra fee for my return flight from Belgrade. At Belgrade airport they made me pay an additional 60 eur for checked in luggage which it didn't made sense since it was already paid online and it showed in my ticket (see pics).,,,,,
"  Terrible experience. I wanted to change my flight a few days before my original date and they tried to refund me only the taxes which is around 2000 dinars (18euros), and not a dinar more of my original ticket. They didn't want to offer me to pay more for another date, which I specifically wanted to do and I know is possible because I have done it in the past. So instead of paying the difference between two tickets (my original and new date), that difference is around 4000 dinars, they wanted to charge me another 18000 dinars for the new ticket and only refund 2000 dinars from the previous one. Again, I didn't do the check-in for the first flight yet, I didn't confirm it, Never flying with them ever again.",,,,,
"  I bought my ticket from Belgrade to Istanbul a month ago. When i came to check in the girl informed me that the flight is overbooked and she is giving me a standby ticket, and only at the gate i will get to know if im flying or not! I've told her that i have another flight from Istanbul to my final destination, and i cant miss it (the ticket was not a connected one. It was from another company) she said she will input it in a note for the priority to get the place. No apologies, no sorry face. I was just told to go to the gate immediately. Obviously she didn't want to deal with the problem and wanted to get rid of me asap. To add that i came very early for check in and was the first. i approached staff at the gate and explained the situation and demanded to be put on this flight. And again i asked why did it happen as ticket was bought a month ago and fully paid. After i raised my concern and asked to speak to a manager they found a free space and confirmed my seat. And how surprised i was when i saw at least 20 free seats after the gate was closed! To conclude the trip, the flight attendants were not pleasant either. They just cared about giving out the drinks as soon as possible before we land. ",,,,,
" Got a very good offer to upgrade and as it allowed me to use the priority screening and having locker space for sure on a busy weekend, I went for it. Was worth the money. Crew was very friendly. Two warm meal options. Actively suggested drinks. Food was good and portion more than enough. Crew topped up water glass automatically. Travelled with hand luggage only. Happy to fly again business. Last Eco flight was 3 years ago and that was good as well. Only negative thing is that I had to go to counter for check-in. Business no issue, if Economy a bit of a hassle. Staff was nice.",,,,,
"  Air Serbia lost my luggage when I arrived in Bucharest on July 1. As of today, no one contact me regarding the status of my baggage. I attempted to call them and no one is picking up the phone. The baggage loss and found department (Romanian Airport Service) at the airport can not be reached because no one is picking up the phone. Not only did no one pick up the phone but worst of all, they also are not responding to email. This is the worst airline I have ever used. it is not worth the trouble.",,,,,
" 2/2 flights delayed by at least an hour with no explanation, no staff around to ask questions or give an estimated departure time. Overall disappointing experience even though staff were present were courteous.",,,,,
"  I went to Zurich and back from Belgrade on 25.12.2021. and back on 31.12.2021. The cabin was clean, the staff was nice, the toilets were clean and the seats were good for a 2-hour flight. The flights were on time. Economy standard tarrif was about 130 euros return which was super cheap. ",,,,,
"  I was flying from Moscow during these hard times, and the Russian Authorities made it complicated for the airline to depart. The plane was about 5hrs late and everybody missed their connection. Air Serbia gave us a hotel, restaurant access and a packed breakfast for those leaving early. They really went out of their way.",,,,,
"  This company need serious customer service education. Lack of information, shady answers and waiting time longer then 20 days to answer is something that you need to calculate if you are willing to purchase tickets with this company! They took all my personal documents for ticket refund and they told me they are able to refund 60 bucks for ticket value of 1300$. Air Serbia put me on hold for 20 days for decision. They asked me for additional documents 3 times and got everything they asked for. Unfortunately they decided to offer $60. Airplane was 20 years old, they are using aircrafts which Etihad got rid of. Air crew were nice and food was solid. Conclusion: don’t expect any money back from this airline! ",,,,,
" Berlin to Belgrade. Terrible! The worst customer service! They stole my money and no one is even trying to help me solve it. They canceled my flight and when I go to their office, they say: ""Try call center"". When I try the call center they say: ""Write an email"" and when I write 15-20 emails, no one is replying. I am Serbian and I am very very disappointed and embarrassed that they represent my country. They should be ashamed and give the job to someone who really wants to work and make this mess better.",,,,,
"  Air Serbia show flights which have already been cancelled. This allows people to pay for them only to later receive emails offering vouchers. Twice I booked with Air Serbia, twice the flights were cancelled, twice they were still shown as available allowing potential passengers to pay for them.",,,,,
"  The worst experience ever. Unprofessional and takes no responsibility whatsoever. From Paris airport Charles de Gaulle trying to get to Greece didn't let me get on my plane the day I was trying to get to my father's funeral. After a quick early check-in, we had a great delay on the passport control where I repeatedly asked to let us pass to get to my gate and ground attendants insisted we won't miss our flights that the airline companies are informed for the delay. I got to the gate just at the moment they closed, with my two year old child that was crying after all the wait. The ground attendant a really unkind and ironic young woman didn't let me pass. I was begging to let me go to my family in this tragic day she was cold with no feelings and telling me that the company will lose money if she let me pass. Her phone rings and a member for the plane asked if they are more passengers left. And she says no, three didn't come I looked on her screen because I was next to her and I see my name with yellow lining like the two other persons too. I shout that I am here so she let me pass but hangs up rapidly. Her colleague was upset and tell hers to let me pass and she says no. I asked her name so I can make a report but she hide her badge telling me she won't give it to me. I contact the airline call center tells me to sent an email with details and never responded. It's been five days. ",,,,,
"  Because of the airline horrible customer service i am left stranded in NY, having to purchase a ticket with another airline to be able to make it to Serbia. My connection was in NY, and I was erroneously informed at check-in to pickup my luggage in NY, which was not the case since the luggage went directly into the plane to Belgrade. I reached out to the customer service and informed them i will make it to the flight, even though will be close, however they decided not to work with me. I wanted to extend my appreciation to the TSA personnel in NY, who were willing to let me through expeditiously through security , and to let Air Serbia know that I will not fly with them again.",,,,,
"  Paid for a ticket and now I´m left without a ticket and money - I´m very disappointed! I bought an online ticket directly from Air Serbia´s website and the payment was successfully made, reservation code was issued without a problem, but they had some internal system problem issuing the electronic ticket. I´ve called support center and they´ve told me that they didn’t receive the payment and for that reason they can’t help me, even I had a printed reservation that indicated that the payment was made successfully. I called my bank and they confirmed that the funds are with the recipient and the refund must be initiated by them (in this case Air Serbia). Air Serbia wasn’t answering my mails and communicating by phone they confirmed that shortly I should receive the refund, refusing to confirm the same by mail and continuing forwarding me to resolve the problem with my bank. In other words, they´re not interested to solve the problem and trying to avoid extra labor. Finally, I´ve paid for something that I don´t possess, without a ticket for my flight and without my money back… I´m very disappointed with unprofessionalism that employees and Air Serbia in generally possesses.  I think Air Serbia doesn’t care about losing clients, at least that’s the impression that I have. I was trying to buy a ticket from Barcelona to Belgrade, but without success and help from the company, and without my money back. This time I will travel with Wizz Air.",,,,,
"  After booking my round ticket with Air Serbia months in advance, they did not notify me that one of my transit flights had been canceled. I flew from Tirana to Atlanta and had a stop at JFK. When preparing to board my next flight at JFK, I learned that that flight did not even exist. I was left outside of the airport with my luggage and able to contact air Serbia. After contacting them, all they could do was put me on a flight the next day without even apologizing for their mistake (I bought the ticket through them, so they are the ones responsible to notify me about flight chances) and they did not care where would I spent the night. I filled a claim, asking for at least a refund of my hotel expenses for that night. After more than one month I have still not heard anything from them. Sent a couple of reminders to let me know the current situation of my claim, and never received a reply back. Would not fly again with this airline, as I have heard I am not the first one experiences these kind of problems.",,,,,
"  Everything regarding the flight went well and on time, no issues whatsoever. The issues aboard the plane arose due to  undisciplined passengers who kept their (obligatory) masks under their chin as soon as the crew were not looking directly at them to warn them to put it on. Unfortunately, the only penalty for such behavior that the crew have at their disposal is to mark the passenger's name and the airline should ban them from flying with them for the next 5 years. Air Serbia has no warning on their website that Serbian citizens, who are currently allowed to travel to Russia for tourism purposes, must land in Moscow only! I bought a ticket to land in Sankt Petersburg and when the Russian Embassy in Belgrade explicitly told me I must land in Moscow (because I am not in any way a resident of Russia, but just a tourist), Air Serbia charged me the price of another full ticket for this change. They defended it by ""availability"", but I just think it is not acceptable. I know it is hard to keep up with government policies but it is their job and they should have a warning on their website that warns non-Russian residents that they are buying a ticket to the wrong airport.",,,,,
  Air Serbia has made it impossible for Covid infected passengers to change the tickets if they get Covid. The change fee is more than the actual ticket cost. I unfortunately got very sick with Covid and notified the airline and travel agency day before my travel. When I got better and got doctor clearance to travel I called both travel agency and Air Serbia and was told the tickets will be $3000 which is more than the initial tickets I paid for and more than the actual ticket price for those dates on Air Serbia website. This is praying on the honesty and plight of Covid sick passengers. In the day of Covid no airline is this cruel to their passengers. Do not give this airline your money.,,,,,
"  Before departure (Zurich - Belgrade in Economy Class) I received an offer from Air Serbia by email - to upgrade to Business Class. I decided to accept the offer, but only for the return flight (Belgrade -  Zurich) because I wanted to do some shopping in Belgrade and there would be no room for this in just one suitcase. It cost me € 95, which was just debited from my Mastercard. At the check-in in Belgrade - surprise: I have no right to 2 suitcases, only one! In response to my complaint that Business Class ALWAYS includes an allowance for 2 suitcases, I was told that I was entitled to all Business Class amenities - except for the number of suitcases. But this ""little thing"" is not to be found in the upgrade offer mail from Air Serbia !!! This argument was also ignored by the Air Serbia officer. In the end I had to pay another 6 € for the ""excess"" 11kg heavy bag! I suspect that this is not a coincidence, but that Air Serbia is purposely improving its income in this lousy way.  Vor dem Abflug (Zürich -> Belgrad in Economy Klasse) habe ich von Air Serbia per Mail ein Angebot erhalten - zu Business Class zu upgraden. Ich entschied mich, das Angebot zu akzeptieren, jedoch nur für den Rückflug (Belgrad -> Zürich) weil ich einiges in Belgrad einkaufen wollte und dies hätte in nur einem Koffer keinen Platz mehr. Es kostete mich 95€, die grad von meiner Mastercard abgebucht wurden. Bei dem Checkin in Belgrad - Überraschung: ich habe kein Anrecht auf 2 Koffer, nur auf einen! Auf meine Reklamation, dass Business Class IMMER Allowance auf 2 Koffer beinhaltet, wurde mir erklärt dass auf alle Annehmlichkeiten der Business Class ich Anrecht habe - bis auf Koffer-Anzahl. Diese ""Kleinigkeit"" aber ist in der Upgrade-Angebot-mail von Air Serbia nicht zu finden!!! Auch dieser Argument wurde von Air Serbia Beamtin ignoriert. Am Ende musste ich für das ""überschüssige"" 11kG schweren Gepäckstück weitere 65€ zahlen! Ich vermute dass dies kein Zufall ist, sondern dass Air Serbia gezielt auf diese miese Art ihre Einkünfte ausbessert.",,,,,
" This is not the first time I flew Air Serbia, but it was the first flying business class. One thing that none of the people complaining about broken wheels (I had those broken by Lufthansa and never saw a refund either!) are saying is that Air Serbia seems to be one of the very few airlines in the world respecting the safety distancing rules that airlines are supposed to obey but do not! All the middle seats on our flight, both in the Economy and Business class were blocked. After flying Air Serbia in December I had to fly Turkish, AeroMexico, Avianca and Viva Colombia and none of them had this policy - we flew as packed as ever. So, hat down to Air Serbia for going this extra mile and flying half empty planes in order to make passengers safer during the pandemic. Every other aspect of our trip was just fine: there was a wonderful lounge with free food in Belgrade, which we used before the flight, the big meal on the flight, we flew safely and comfortably, the crew was very kind and polite, our luggage made it, and the touchdown at Istanbul was like landing on cotton. I could not wish anything more from an airline. Thank you and keep up the good work.",,,,,
"  This is the second time our luggage has been damaged. First time a wheel has been broken and I thought “ok, it happens” but this time two of three luggages have been destroyed. I know they rough with the luggage and all but I wish I could see how did they manage this kind of damage. To top it all off they are refusing any kind of compensation.",,,,,
  I purchased 6 tickets to fly with my family on 24 December 2020 to Belgrade from JFK. Tickets are for me and my husband and our 4 children. However because of such a high cases of Covid in Belgrade we decided that it’s unsafe for our children and us to travel at this time and also per our governers advisory of Washington DC. I reached out to Air Serbia and of course they don’t care even tho I travel with Air Serbia two time a year to go back home and they won't even give me a credit back to purchase another ticket. They want me to pay penalty for each ticket before changing which is $250 per ticket.,,,,,
" I have been a regular flyer for the last few years and Air Serbia is without doubt the most incompetent airline I have ever flown with. The staff do not know what they are doing, they repeatedly ask you ""We see you are flying hand luggage only"" despite having paid for hold luggage. They have no idea about what citizens need a visa for said country. Their website is beyond awful, once you have made a booking it says error so you think that you need to try again, in fact the booking has been successful and you now have two bookings. In addition to all of this, their flight prices are the most extortionate I have ever seen, do yourself a favour and choose any other airline to this one.",,,,,
" Belgrade to Berlin with Air Serbia. Not respecting single Covid-19 rule, no sanitizers, employees not wearing masks! Using small planes that are super crowded and no space for legs, seats are super small. It is worse than flying with a low-cost airline!",,,,,
" I bought a ticket for 18.06. however as I was prevented from traveling (corona virus) I had to postpone the flight for 02.07. I called the call center and they said I had to pay 90e because of the price difference. In the meantime, I had to reschedule the flight for 09.07. and again to pay another 50EUR. Due to the impossibility of traveling, I wanted to postpone the flight again, but since I no longer knew for which date I wanted to leave the ticket open and use it until the end of this year, which they did not allow, and I had to choose another date and pay 50EUR again. In the end, I did not want to pay for the postponement of the ticket again, and I asked for a refund. I paid 300EUR for the ticket and they only refunded me 55EUR for airport taxes. I couldn’t get the rest of the money because the flight was operational. Btw they don't reply to e-mails and the call center can hardly be reached.",,,,,
  The only way you can fly to Belgrade from Sweden. Old planes. Bad customer support. I have emailed and called several times for two weeks but they simply don't answer. Cabin crew with bad attitude,,,,,
"  We purchased two tickets Ljubljana to Athens on 2 Mar 2020 in EUR 140 and within 24 hours because of Covid-19 cases in Ljubljana, requested for the refund as per their 100% refund policy. On 5 Mar they wrote us they will only refund only 66 EUR within 7-30 days, but as on 5 May 2020 we have not received any amount. What type of airline is Air Serbia?  We repeatedly requested the airline to refund, every time they said 7-30 days, you will get the refund but as on date not received any amount.",,,,,
  Tirana to Lubljana via Belgrade. I had my flight 22 March. I asked at the beginning to anticipate but no way. Cause of coronavirus and was told to. Me only taxes can be reimbursed. For sure I said ok at least the taxes. I also asked later for a bonus with the same company cause of the situation covid but was told. To. At the beginning I try to talk to them but after 30 min in phone waiting international call I tried by email. And by email they told was not possible the bonus. Still have to wait for the money of the airport taxes. Not professional when my  friends from other companies had the money back. Or bonus.,,,,,
"  Our flight JU 802 to Istanbul on 30.12.2019 has been delayed by more than three hours. I missed my shuttle bus to Istanbul Sabiha airport and had to take the taxi in order not to miss my flight from SAW on New Year's eve (100km distance). We arrived at 19:00 local time instead of 15:55. Scheduled departure 12:20. The aircraft (YU-API) arrived one hour late from Milan. On departure we were notified that the catering truck has broken down. Then boarding started at 13:00. At 14:00 we were informed the crew duty hours have expired. We departed only around 15:00. Time at gate on arrival at IST was 19:00. Then we discovered that Air Serbia has been transporting hundreds of Lufthansa bags from Frankfurt which was the real reason of the delay. Passengers were unable to get their luggage cause the baggage carousel (meant for A320) has been blocked by Lufthansa bags coming from a wide-body from Munich (flight waited in Belgrade). It is horrible that Air Serbia gives priorities on New year's holidays to bags from Lufthansa than to their own passengers. Our bags arrived last. Finally i received my luggage at 19:30 and had one hour to arrive at an airport 100km away (6 hours planned for that trip). The taxi  cost me 55 Eur. (60.61 USD). Also, although the delay exceeded 2 hours, we weren't offered any refreshments whatsoever. Air Serbia dismissed all these claims saying they were late 'only' 2h20 minutes on departure and they won't compensate any expenses incured. Disgraceful.",,,,,
"  Zurich to Beirut via Belgrade. This Airline is very unprofessional. My flights were cancelled exactly 15 days before departure so the airline would not pay indemnities. They offered to contact them via phone. My calls were never answered and I had to pay an expensive price for all the calls. My online claim was never responded to and I did not get any alternatives to my ticket. Although the airline indicate that refund is made within 7 working days, I have been waiting for two weeks with no refund. I do not recommend this airline.",,,,,
"  Amsterdam to Belgrade. Lost one of my bags. 39 days past the statutory 60 day deadline for solving the claim and its I still not resolved, 99 days and counting. No customer support and false promises.",,,,,
"  Would give the airline zero if it was possible. I flew with them from Helsinki to Ljubljana via Belgrade. First problem was that about a week after booking the flight they have moved the second flight for almost 2 hours (longer layover in Belgrade). The same thing happened again three days before departure, they moved the second flight again for another hour and a half. At the end we were delayed for 2 hours without any explanation. When I finally reached my destination in the plane probably 30 years older than me with no space for legs or carry-on luggage, I learned that my luggage was destroyed. The handle used for rolling the suitcase was broken, there were big tears in the material and also a big dent. All together the baggage is now not usable and I cannot get it repaired. Following the instructions and filling out the damage claim at the destination airport I submitted a claim to Air Serbia. They replied that they are not liable and that their decision regarding my claim was final. Worst airline I have ever used and will never fly with them again.",,,,,
"  Belgrade to Kiev. My experience with Air Serbia did not start well, whilst I was booking my ticket online I was asked me for my Visa details for Ukraine, despite the fact that i'm a British citizen and don't need a Visa. The online form would not allow me to skip this information so I ended up having to call customer service. To be fair to Air Serbia it was not difficult to get through to an agent and the phone call was charged at a normal rate. Once I was connected to an operator we cleared up the issue, and then the lady said ""Oh by the way, I can see you have not paid for any luggage"". I told her with some indignation that I had paid for an extra suitcase and eventually she found this to be correct. Between then and my flight I also received numerous emails telling me that I had not paid for luggage Once I arrived at the airport the idiocy continued on Air Serbia's part, I was once again asked for my Visa and the check in person had to call someone to ask them if I needed Visa. Eventually someone confirmed I did not. Then they said again ""Did you know that you haven''t paid for extra luggage?!"" Speechless Once on the plane everything was fine, I will try to avoid this airline in future, they are also exorbitantly expensive on many routes",,,,,
"  Belgrade to Zurich. Employees are rude, non-caring and just don't care for passengers. Instead of helping passengers with their questions and problems, they brush them off and keep doing what they were doing before someone even asked them for help, that is, nothing! Even though I'm a Serbian myself, I experienced first-hand their hospitality and their non-willingness to help many times! Tonight it was enough, as far as I'm concerned I wouldn't use Air Serbia! There are many more airlines that are much better than them. Not to mention, cheaper.",,,,,
"  Moscow to Vienna via Belgrade. It was my first and the last flight with Air Serbia. I will never fly with this company again. First, I tried to order (and pay for it) a special meal. The website of Air Serbia is quite bad, many functions do not work and it was no possible to order a special meal on the website in “My bookings” section. My booking even did not appear on my personal webpage. So, I sent an email with my booking number to Air Serbia. To order a special meal they advised me to call one of the offices of Air Serbia at the airports and order it. I have spent more than 90 minutes in total on the phone trying to reach different offices in Vienna, Moscow, Krasnodar, Copenhagen, Berlin and Belgrade. Every time I was waiting more than 15 minutes on the line and listened to the message “Please hold the line, all operators are busy”. That time I did not reach the call center by the phone. I sent again an email to their email address, informed them that it is not possible to reach an office, gave them my phone number and asked them to call me back kin order to order a special meal. Nobody called me back and nobody answered to my email. 36 hours before departure I got an email from Air Serbia with an invitation to do online check-in for the flight. I wanted to buy a seat on the first row but in the last step, system did not allow me to proceed with the payment for seat reservation because of a mistake on the website of Air Serbia. So, I decided to call the Air Serbia call centre again. On Jan 6 at 9-57 (Moscow time) I finally reached Air Serbia. I asked the agent to help me with online check-in and to order for me a special meal. The agent told me that it is not possible to order a special meal and she does not the reason why it is not possible. She just told me “I do not know how I can order in the system a special meal for this flight”. As regards online check-in she started to proceed with the booking and after 10 minutes she told me that she cannot choose a seat for me because “the seats are already at the airport in Moscow” and I can register only at the airport. I told her that it cannot be the truth but she was absolutely useless and did not want to help. She could even hardly speak English. I spent almost 15 minutes on the phone with her and she did absolutely nothing for me. I asked her name for a complaint and she refused to tell it to me. I told her that I hope that the call has been recorded. 2 hours before departure I got an email from them (which was obviously an answer to my request which I sent a week ago) where another agent wrote me that a special meal should be ordered 24 hours in advance. I think that Air Serbia agents are very unprofessional. It is a mess within a company, the call center does not work, the agents do not care about clients and they simply do not know how to work. The plane from Belgrade to Vienna was extremely old and it was not enough space between seats. The seat in front of me was broken.  As a snack we got two small pieces of cookies and a small bottle of water. I even cannot call it “snack”. ",,,,,
"  
Moscow to Milan via Belgrade. Delay in flights and luggage delivery. Your luggage will be lost at 95% because they use small airplane And exceed the takeoff weight so definitely they take only the first half or even less than 50% of the passenger’s suite cases and expect if you get lucky to receive your lugage in the next 6 to 8 weeks after. As for this moment, I am leaving MXP to Singapore without my suitecas and I don’t know where I will get it or maybe will not and as of the This moment.",,,,,
"  Frankfurt to Tirana via Belgrade. Worst airline ever. I had a two way ticket and didn't use the first one, so the company just cancelled the returning flight without contacting me first or letting me know about that.  I had to spent a lot of money calling their support (because the representative in Tirana Airport was useless). They even told me they would refund 79euro which they did not! The ticket was way more then that. ",,,,,
"  Bucharest to New York via Belgrade on 3rd January. My first flight landed in Timisoara (TMR), a small city in Romania instead of Belgrade, around 10:30am. They said it was too foggy but all other flights that day managed to land on BEG so the reason is dubious. Then, we ended up spending ~10hr in Belgrade, without any food, or information from AirSerbia representatives. I know they are obligated to give you food and water if the delay is longer than 2-3 hours. There were no representatives of any company to talk to in the TMR airport because we were at the gates and it is a very small airport. After realizing that I missed my connection from BEG to JFK, I called AirSerbia but they said that it is not their fault and they cannot do anything and once I get to Belgrade they will try to help. At ~4:30pm, after 6 hours of waiting, they decided that there will send a bus to take us from TMR to BEG (> 3hr of driving, while the OTP - BEG flight was ~1hr) and the plane will return to OTP and we have to make a decision of what to do. I would like to mention that the road death rate in Romania is of ~100 deaths / 1M people and that of flying is ~0 so it is absolutely unacceptable to ask us to take a bus to BEG, put our lives in such danger since we did not book a bus we booked a plane ticket. They did not want to send another aircraft although they had the resources to do so. They promised the bus will leave around ~5pm but then said it won't leave until 6-7pm. It ended up leaving after 8pm. Realizing we would be arriving extremely late to Belgrade and there won't be much support for us there (there were barely any flights to NYC in the next few days and all of them were extremely expensive and pretty much none with AirSerbia for the next week or so). I called AirSerbia to ask them to book my ticket since we were going to Belgrade and I wanted confirmation that once in Belgrade I have everything set and there is actually a point in going there. I would have preferred to do this before making my decision but they made us decide on the spot with no information of where and how we can get rerouted if we choose either option. AirSerbia told me that they cannot book on the phone and they cannot book a ticket if I go back to Bucharest with the flight which is insane given that the plane was the only way of transportation I had paid for. Anyway, around 7pm, I decided to not take the bus to Belgrade because I did not want to risk my life and get my own flight back and fight them via complaints and in court. Please do not ever use this airline!!",,,,,
"  New York to Bucharest via Belgrade. If your flight gets cancelled or delayed, call and fight them until they rebook or reimburse you, and and do not accept a ""it's not possible, we cannot do anything, there are no connections"". Answer, it is within your rights!! Also submit a claim against them to get compensated for a delayed or cancelled flight.",,,,,
"  Stockholm to Belgrade. The worst airline. I would recommend everyone avoid it if they can. Today my brother was supposed to return to Serbia with that company, but he couldn't because they sold his ticket. I was told that because he did not use the incoming ticket, so he automatically canceled the return ticket. Otherwise, he found out an hour before the flight, and in the meantime, emails were arriving to upgrade the flight with bigger luggage.",,,,,
"  Milan to Istanbul via Belgrade. After reading these reviews I was rather apprehensive about the trip, and indeed there was a delay for my first flight (I think because they needed a replacement aircraft), with the flight arriving Belgrade 40 minutes late. However, the airport in Belgrade is very small and pleasant, and a joy to change in, when compared to bigger hubs like Frankfurt, and I (and my luggage) made the connection despite only having 40 minutes between the flights. Staff both at the airport and on the aircraft were perfectly polite. The flights were satisfactory and there was a bottle of water and crisps or biscuits handed out. You don’t get the explanations or the polish you’d get on British Airways for example, but it was perfectly adequate and very good value. The connecting flight to Istanbul arrived on time and was comfortable, so based on my experience I’d be happy to recommend it.",,,,,
"  Athens to Helsinki via Belgrade. Our company booked the trip trough Air Serbia website. I was travelling together with my boss and colleague who had return flights from Helsinki to Athens but I flew to (Athens) from Rome. We booked one-way ticket from Air Serbia website. After filling the payment information we got the ""Trip Confirmation"" to our e-mail with Confirmation code. This was only e-mail we received from Air Serbia. We printed out this document and showed it at the check in desk on 29.10.2019. They replied ""there is no such booking and the aircraft is overbooked"". We did not understand what they meant by ""overbooked"" and why a confirmed flight did not exist. There was no help at the airport to sort the situation so we called Air Serbia. They repeated ""we have no such booking"". For a reason or another this trip was cancelled and we never got a good answer for why. There was enough credit on the card, the trip was confirmed from the company, we had the necessary document from the confirmation but could not check in. I had to get back to Finland soonest possible and the airline did not do anything about this so my boss booked me a return ticket to the next available flight (Air Turkey) 724,51€ that is quite much for a trip that should cost around 100€. Later at the airport I contacted Air Serbia again and now they replied that ""we can see the booking but maybe there has been some problem with Air Serbia website"". They did not give any explanation about why this flight was cancelled?! Maybe because they had overbooked the plane and had to drop out someone?? I am stunned about how bad this airline handled this situation. The rest of the evaluation about the flight comes from my boss whose reservation was valid.",,,,,
" Helsinki to Athens via Belgrade. Worst airline ever! Rude staff, long lines, no food, dirty airplanes that have a weird smell. They changed the airplane before the flight from an Airbus A320 jet to some old Boeing (probably 737) it took off shaking left and right and smelled like something was burning. The sound system gave me a headache and what they were saying was unintelligible even the safety instructions. I have seen third world countries airlines with better services and standards. Even budget airlines are way more comfortable. If you are thinking about flying with Air Serbia then think again. I am never afraid of flying but this time I did feel flying anxiety on board their flights.",,,,,
"  Helsinki to Rome via Belgrade. Was very impressed with my flight with Air Serbia. The seats were OK comfort wise. I was very impressed with the food service - our flight to Belgrade was 2 hours long and we got complimentary cookies and water. On our next flight, which was 1 hour, we got complimentary chips and water. I was not expecting to be given anything to eat on this short flight. I would recommend Air Serbia, but avoid a stop in Belgrade if you can.",,,,,
"  Ljubljana to Athens via Belgrade . One of the most unreliable airlines in Europe: constantly long delays which frequently result in missing connections. Lack of professional service both on the ground and in the air. Unfriendly and indifferent cabin staff. Unacceptable preseating policy. A very cheap product in general, even worse than on budget airlines. Very bad value for money: a rough low cost service at a not at all low cost price. Should be avoided at any cost.",,,,,
"  I wanted to book a ticket from London to Belgrade, but the web site displayed and error during the payment step (I am using a MasterCard issued by a big UK bank and haven't had many issues with online payments). I tried to pay again, and got the same message. Then I went through all the steps again, but the web page again displayed the same error message. After failing to purchase the ticket three times, I decided to use a different airline for the flight. I bought a ticket there with no problems. Half an hour later I received an email confirming my AirSerbia reservation. I immediately called their customer service to ask for a refund. I was told that I need to send an email with all the details. I did that. The next day I received a response stating that they cannot refund the full price of the ticket. I tried again explaining everything, but no luck again. I can only get about half of the ticket price refunded according to the ticket conditions, even though the whole problem was because of a bug in their system. So my interaction with AirSerbia resulted in my being out of a few hundred pounds because of a bug in their system and unhelpful customer service. I am not going to use their services in the future.",,,,,
"  Split to Madrid via Belgrade. Was meant to transit in Belgrade for 45 minutes. However first flight was delayed by about 50 minutes. When we got to Belgrade we had to rush to collect transit tickets and run to catch the flight. When we arrived in Madrid, our luggage never showed up. Had to spend even more time at the airport making delayed / lost baggage reports. A total of 3 hours wasted! And the next day, the status of my luggage is still showing as ""pending"". Another girl on the flight had this happen to her both ways. Calling their 24 hour contact centre is useless. I tried this from the originating airport and am trying it now again. You are on hold forever, no one ever picks up the call. The flight and attendants are fine. But the airline management is absolutely horrendous! Do not fly them unless you are prepared to face flight delays, lost luggage and zero support after.",,,,,
"  Vienna to Belgrade. My wife and me fly a lot of times with different airlines during the year - and this could also have been an flight with Eurowings, Austrian Airlines or something like this. The personnel was not too friendly but were polite. As we had booked an Economy ticket, we were able to check in our luggage for free without any problems. The flight had no delay and we arrived Belgrade punctual. Our luggage arrived without any damage.",,,,,
 New York to Tel Aviv via Belgrade. Worst airline I have ever flown with. 2 big delays. No solutions for the people. The only solution is to stay 2 nights in Serbia. Shame. Ruined my experience in New York. Will not book this airline ever again,,,,,

One of the worst companies I've ever flown with. 1.5 hr delay, lost luggage, no answer the whole day, when finally answered, the representative said they don't work on weekends!

"  Booked flight Etihad from Kuala Lumpur to London on 10 August. First transit in Abu Dhabi, second transit in Belgrade. Code share  with Air Serbia (JU). Flight from Belgrade to London was cancelled 1 hour prior to departure. JU reschedule flight 24hrs after that (4.50pm, 12Aug). Our agent in Kuala Lumpur have make numerous calls to Air Serbia, and they are unable to rebook our flight to earlier time. Worse they said she has rebooked flight from Belgrade to Brussels to London (arrive in London around 1145am, 12Aug) and even given us the booking number & ticket number. Turn out that it is a lie. Etihad Airways offers zero help at all too, saying that Air Serbia has taken over the booking and there’s nothing they can do about it. We’re stuck at Belgrade airport for more than 24hrs. Ground staff refuse to help on obtaining visa or even offering hotel for the screw up they make. This is the worst airline ever. And we blame Etihad too for simply forsaking their duties to their paying customer!",,,,,
  Belgrade to Stockholm. We have flown with Air Serbia many times and I am sorry to say that every time it has been a bad experience. Always late and the service is very bad - not to recommend.,,,,,
"  Berlin to Cairo via Belgrade. Company is a complete and utter disaster. Starting from the booking of my ticket, I did not get an e-ticket via email as the booking process got interrupted only to find out the ticket was booked via my credit card notification. The flight from Berlin to Belgrade was delayed 2 hours - in information was given on whether connecting flight can be caught or not and whether it even makes sense to fly. In Belgrade it got even worse. Connecting flight to Cairo was delayed by 3 hours, no refreshments were provided. After boarding plane turned back and we had to disembark cause suddenly they realized that the crew was too long in the air. Security handled the justifiable anger of the passengers by detaining five for talking too loud while no further explanations were given on what will happen next. Never again",,,,,
" Amsterdam to Belgrade. This company is terrible! I booked the ticket for my mom to visit me in Los Angeles. She had a flight back from LAX to AMS and then in Amsterdam, she just received a text that her flight to Belgrade (operated by Air Serbia) was canceled, without any further notice for more than 24h. She is an older lady with a high blood pressure stuck in the airport without hotel provided or anything else. After more than 24h of me calling and my family, we arranged another flight for her (not Air Serbia) and finally, she is back home safe and sound. Don't ever travel on Air Serbia, they don't care about their passengers.",,,,,
"  Copenhagen to Athens via Belgrade. The plane arrived almost an hour late on their first flight arriving from Belgrade. They didn’t pick up any of the lost time on the way and feared our luggage wouldn’t make it on to the connected flight from Belgrade to Athens. That didn’t become an issue. Because the next plane was delayed as well. No information was shared. Watching the ground staff, the passengers time didn’t seem to be a concern for Air Serbia, so no one understood why the plane was delayed.",,,,,
"  Ljubljana to Split via Belgrade. 50 euros baggage fee for 1 checked 10 kg bag was excessive. Also, my last 3 messages to their Facebook page about my flight were never replied to. One part of my flight was 25 minutes late, no explanation.",,,,,
"  Athens to Stuttgart via Belgrade. Well-kept aircraft, seat pitch was very good and seats were leather covered. Service was limited to a small bottle of water and crackers, everything else you have to pay. There is a good option to visit the Belgrade Airport lounge for €18 where you can be in a modern, quiet space with great food and alcoholic drinks. Service there was superb. You can upgrade to Business from €60 where there is access to lounge, 2 carry on and food during flight.",,,,,
"  Belgrade to Berlin. I recommend avoiding Air Serbia at any cost. Their badly implemented website made me thinking I successfully bought ticket with hold luggage included which was not the case. That's gonna cost me additional 50 euros now. I couldn't even bought an extra-legroom seat due to 'unexpected bug', as they operator claims.",,,,,
" Venice to Athens via Belgrade. I rarely give bad review so I will keep it short; mighty be best to avoid if at all possible, save yourself the hassle. The price is not worth the stress of late flightS or the unpleasantness of the flight (the noise from the motors was very loud from beginning to end). Flight and ground crew were nice.",,,,,
" Belgrade to Amsterdam. Serious bag and problems during online check in process. They need to fix this at once! Once you have selected and paid for seat in online check-in process you can't go back or deselect them and return to a free one. The only thing you can do and that I found out after calling customer support is to wait for a manual restart of check-in process and that needs approx. 2 hours. What will happen if your credit card is not accepted for seat payment, like in my case, and you are checking in just hours before the flight? Customer support was not surprised by my question like it's something normal. She even suggested to leave her with credit card information so that they can authorize by themself. Air Serbia looks like a fresh and modern aviation company from the outside, but from the inside, many problems are showing up. Hopefully, management will change soon with addition to government of Serbia stepping out from owner structure.",,,,,
"  Avoid them at any cost. In January 2018, Air Serbia cancelled our flight Los Angeles to Dusseldorf and Dusseldorf to Belgrade. Since then, we have been trying to get our money back, more than $1000, for the missing flights. First with an indirect claim via the seller of the tickets (MyTrip.com) and then directly via Air Serbia customer support. Until today, we got only replies from Air Serbia asking to give them some more time. The reality is, their customer service has no intention to solve this claim and gives us back our money. As a regular customer of Air Serbia so far, I recommend you to avoid them at any cost.",,,,,
  Skopje to New York via Belgrade. Last time ever we are flying with Air Serbia. I don’t even know where to begin. First of all when we landed in Belgrade they delayed our flight. I asked them why & they replied to me “there is no plane”. How are they selling plane tickets if they don’t have a plane. Second of all I when I got to Skopje I was there for a whole week with no luggage. I had a wedding & I didn’t have any of my stuff. I had to buy a new dress for the wedding and new clothes for that whole week. After a week only one of my luggage came. The second luggage came three days after. On the way back home I didn’t get my luggage again for 5 days. The people in Belgrade at the airport are very rude and not helpful at all. I would speak English to them because I don’t speak Serbian & they would reply in Serbian. I even told them & they still didn’t speak English.,,,,,
"  Check-in for the flight went fine, and gate 21 at T4 at Heathrow used for Air Serbia flights is very spacious and nice for aircraft spotting. Flight from Belgrade arrived on time, but boarding started some 15 minutes prior scheduled departure so we were slightly delayed, and arrival in Belgrade was 5 minutes late after scheduled arrival. The cabin was full in economy and only one passenger in business (there were 9 businesses seats available for this flight). Business class is now changed, earlier it used to have different leather seats in configuration 2-2 and now it is flexible, the seats are the same as in economy 3-3 with guaranteed empty middle seat. Soon after departure crew gave us free snacks and a glass of water. Later on, they started serving sandwiches, drinks and snacks from their Deli menu (paid menu). Unfortunately, no hot food available on this 2.5 hour flight was available. Prices of Deli menu were fair and the quality of food was good - much better than they served them for free in the past. My opinion is that it’s better to get tasty sandwich for money now than two pieces of bread with butter inside for free :) Airline crew did their job professionally and their appearance was nice. Captain made few announcements during the flight about our route and weather conditions at the destination airport so that was fine too. There was no flight entertainment available but I had option to buy WiFi internet access. Landing went fine. Overall, it was a nice flight.",,,,,
" Milan to Belgrade. I would suggest to anyone to avoid Etihad in general and especially Air Serbia. Often Etihad sells tickets under its name and afterwards flight is operated by Air Serbia (all flights via belgrade) and that is the biggest nightmare you can have. Terrible service in general, flights aways delayed for at least 45-60 min. Often longer delays. My last experience - engine got on fire while the airplane was leaving the gate, and following this we had 10 hours delay (2 hours in the plane, 2 hanging around begging for info, 2 further reschedulings of the departure). Air Serbia is keeping the monopoly of Belgrade airport and I need to use it unfortunately, but if you can avoid it, do it!",,,,,
"  Flew Air Seychelles from Seychelles to Mauritius (had to take this as this would be the only direct option with a high price of $300+), and this became my worst flight experience in my life as my original departure time of Apr. 19, 10:00 eventually became Apr. 20, 15:10. A transactional email arrives the night before the flight that the flight will be delayed but new flight time will be released later on, shattering my sleep already as I am in fear that my travel plans will be disrupted (and it did in a serious manner). Had to be at the airport on time nonetheless (as I now know that Air Seychelles will never care about my travel plans and therefore I will have to be at the airport to be at the scene myself) and another email arrives that 13:20 would be the new departure time. But then nothing happens and nobody at the check-in counter knows what is going on except that there is a ""discussion"" about the flight's fate if it would fly out on 13:20 as planned or not (and it did not). Finally, at around 11:00 an Air Seychelles temporary employee approaches the passengers that the flight is ""decided"" to be delayed (a quick check on its two A320 Neos reveal that they are flying other routes instead, but no explanations were given at all so how would I know what is happening at all) and that all passengers will have to stay where Air Seychelles sends them to. All passengers end up taking the bus provided by Air Seychelles (after loading their luggage on an open truck's cargo hold) and are all bussed to a terrible resort about 30 minutes away from the airport. Then rooms were assigned arbitrarily (couples were okay but solo travelers were randomly assigned rooms together) and a terrible lunch buffet with only one free non-alcoholic beverage was offered (not even a meal voucher as that would be so much more expensive to the airline). Then we were told by Air Seychelles that the flight could depart any time that day or the day after and that the passengers should wait for the call in their hotel rooms (that is, someone should be in the hotel room instead of being at the beach in front of the resort) as well as frequently consult Air Seychelles Facebook page for updates. Then the hotel calls that passengers should gather by 11:00 the next morning without even telling us what the new departure time would be (had to check myself via the aforementioned Facebook page that the new departure time had been announced as Apr. 20, 15:10). Then the next morning, once again the weird bussing back from the hotel to the airport, and then found out that an Ethiopian B737-MAX8 was there to run the route instead. Checked-in and finally departed at around 15:40, landing in Mauritius at around 18:00 (a whopping ~30 hour delay). Cannot say much about the aircraft and in-flight service as it was provided by Ethiopian Airlines, but it was pretty basic with basic seats without any IFE and a tiny sandwich given during the flight (alcoholic beverages were available though). At the end of the day, my Mauritius travel plans were disrupted without any reimbursement of any kind from the airline for the losses. I heard before that Air Seychelles had financial troubles in the past and now I think understand why. Will never fly again with Air Seychelles, and even give up Seychelles as my vacation destination if Air Seychelles is unavoidable.",,,,,
"  We were travelling back to Johannesburg after a vacation in the Maldives when my husband suddenly lost consciousness after about 90 minutes in the air. The cabin crew were outstanding. They found a Doctor on the flight, brought the oxygen, helped administer the oxygen, calmed the family down and were caring and kind for 2 hours. When we landed in the Seychelles, an ambulance was on the runway and the excellent Sara Chang Pen, Guest Service Agent for Air Seychelles, took over. She accompanied us to the hospital and negotiated our admission and treatment there, staying with us for several hours until he was well enough to be discharged. She also booked us into a hotel, organized our passports to be stamped, sent our luggage to the hotel and ensured we were booked on the earliest flight home 3 days later. I do not believe that we could have had better service on any other airline and we are truly grateful for their excellent service.",,,,,
 They keep on cancelling the flights. I had to reschedule my itinerary twice before finally cancelling my flight for third time. Avoid.,,,,,
" Praslin to Mahe. Over zealous security screening at Praslin when they noticed we had packed a small pack of batteries in our hold baggage. Had to take out every item of clothing until they were found and no time to repack. On check in we thought we had prepaid for excess baggage via our travel agent only to be told it had not gone through. Staff could see that we had completed the process but still charged us the airport price rather than the online price. Staff completely unhelpful and appeared to take great pleasure in making things as difficult as possible. Would not give us any assistance of any contact details. Currently taking up the issue with their customer services and the office of their CEO. Flight cramped and noisy, recommend ear plugs, and very warm. Plus side, it was shorter than most bus journey I normally take. No assistance offered by ground crew getting on or off the plane with flimsy hand rail and low doorway.",,,,,
"  We were booked on a one-way flight from Praslin to Mauritius (PRI-SEZ-MRU). The checkin in Praslin was pretty smooth. The lady told us that our baggage is directed to Mauritius, nothing to worry about on Mahé. Great news! After arrival we had to checkin again as the second flight was international. At the counter I mentioned casually that we only have two backpacks as carry on as our checked baggage is transferred to Mauritius. ""No that is not possible"" we were told. ""You have to pick it up at the baggage claim and check it in again."" After some discussions I went back. Luckily a met a couple from the UK that did the same trip as we did. Same problem there. We found an Air Seychelles employee, explained the situation, gave her our baggage tags we got earlier at Praslin and followed her back to the counter. They were having an argue. Unbelievable. Both flights operated by one airline that does not know their internal procedures and processes. After we were told that the baggage is transferred to Mauritius - surprise - the real problems began as my girlfriend was traveling with her wheelchair that comes with electrically powered wheels. We showed them the necessary IATA certificates and technical specs as we always do in that situation around the globe with many airlines. Airlines are generally not pleased to transport batteries in the cargo area due to potential risk of fire. But in this case the batteries are an integrated part of the wheels. You cannot take them off without taking off both wheels completely. So as usual they checked everything and let us finally continue. So far so good. After boarding was finished the captain announced that we were actually early some minutes.  But suddenly the lady from the check-in appeared at our seats to tell us that the wheelchair will not be transported by Air Seychelles because an approval was missing. We had no idea what she meant. As I already wrote we had shown them the papers. And by the way we had sent the all the documents five days ahead of the flight as requested by Air Seychelles. We never got a reply to that email. They still insisted an approval was missing. Just to mention again: No issues with the same airline on the first flight segment before... However three to four employees were discussing at the aircraft door. After 30 minutes the captain explained the situation to all passengers via speaker. He said they are organizing the missing approval and are waiting for it. What missing approval and how are they organizing it by themselves when the complained that we did not bring the approval. Simply does not make sense at all. After an hour I accidentally could observe a guy walking right next to the aircraft carrying the wheelchair's wheels with the batteries. Minutes later we took off without further information. After arrival in Mauritius we found the wheelchair in parts lying on the floor in front of the special baggage counter. Some idiots bent one of the shafts that connect the wheels to the chassis. Without any tools and with pure force I could barely fix the shaft. Otherwise our trip had ended at this point. We have never ever experienced that kind of discrimination against people with disabilities anywhere on the globe. Totally unprofessional and completely intolerable. The Seychelles are probably the most beautiful places we have ever seen on earth but Air Seychelles is a catastrophe. Shame on you!",,,,,
  Our flight was booked to fly in December 21st but Seychelles was closed to visitors from South Africa due to COVID. We never flew. Since then I have been asking for either a refund or travel voucher as we are expecting to re-book for December 22. But after several emails and requests Air Seychelles do not respond. What is one supposed to do to get what we paid for?,,,,,
"  I had booked flight back from Praslin airport where we had our hotel Lemuria back to Mahe for our international flight. So we booked flight at 5th of may directly in the airport, becouse it was near our hotel. So my trip back to Mahe was like scary movie, and all of a service for the Air Seychelles was awfull. First of all - our flight was booked for 9th may - thats sunday, this is a day off at the airport - so nobody will take phone, nobody will answer you on email, and only service for flight who dont know anything will work at the airport. Be very careful to use their flights on Sundays. In the morning 9th of may at the day of our departure we noticed that a storm comes to an islands, but we saw flights still are going, and nobody told us that something will be wrong (we had flight at 18 -40), so we packed everything and were preparing to leave. Thanks to Lemuria hotel crew at 12 o clock we were told that the airport is closed and there will be no flights today, they also sent their man to have duty in the airport if something else happened, and he called every 30 minutes. Air Seychelles didn't even get in touch with us in that day, didn't answer the phones etc. The ferry that goes only 2 times a day was already sold completely for that day. So we and other passengers had to book boats not to miss their international flights. When we arrived to the airport for our flight, planes from Air Seychelles still were not flying, and we get back home. After we get home I sent email and all information air Seychelles manager asked us for ticket refund, and we get only about 30% of money for our tickets, because we were charged for ""no show"" at non working airport, and refund charge. That's a total disgrace.  If you use them you should have some additional money for private boats. Be ready for ""no calls, no service"" at critical situations, cause you may get to the airport and it would be closed in case of weather and other transport (ferry, boats) will be unavailable at the time you noticed it.",,,,,
"  Seychelles to Johannesburg. Below average service from in flight attendants. Appalling attitude, inability to carry out basic duties. Do not respond when they are buzzed, and expect you to walk to the back of the aircraft to get what you need eg a glass of water. This is a problem as the lavatory is also at the back, so at any given time theres a queue of passengers trying to navigate through the narrow aisle at the back of the aircraft. Furthermore, they are absolutely not child friendly, and made the flight very unpleasant for me and my family.",,,,,
" Johannesburg to Seychelles. Online check-in for Codeshare flight from Etihad is not possible. Airplane is a brand new 32N, no issues there. Seat comfortable, even for a five-hour flight. Wifi-based IFE has a very limited choice of films. Crew rather reserved and looked a bit bored and annoyed at the same time - friendly if approached though. Crews English is tough to understand. Loved the bright red blankets!",,,,,
"  Johannesburg to Mumbai via Mahe. My wife and mother-in-law travelled with our 5 year old son and 1 year old son. While flying from Johannesburg to Seychelles, our younger sons cries more than normal day in home. My family reached Seychelles island and cabin crew decided that my baby has high fever and not to show of next connected flight. My family was forced to go to hospital and the doctor decided that it is not high fever and having ear infection. First of all the airport doesn't have any facilities to check this kind of basic things. While coming back from airport, the lady who followed with my wife forcefully taken the medical report from my wife. May be they can use that for getting some extra money somehow. The drama starts now. Initially they told that they will arrange everything, but they changed the decision. I was in south Africa and I never had a medium to contact with my wife and airport wifi also not working as like other. So I couldn't able to tell everything at right time, so unfortunately I don't have Dr report. Seychelles support staff said that only option is to book the accomodation and book Srilankan Airways which is the next flight to Mumbai and will be reaching Mumbai after 36 hours or something. So ideally we need to book everything from our pocket and even they will not help for getting taxi to the hotel. My family has three check in bag and two child. With help of my friends here in SA, I immediately booked Emirates flight and my wife told me that she will wait in airport for 8 hours for emirates. My family waited 8 hours without anything to eat. You cant get anything to eat if your family waiting for the flight that time. I am waiting for my family check in from Dubai. ",,,,,
"  Well, we never got to actually fly. It was supposed to be a two-day break in the Seychelles on the way from Madagascar to the UAE. First it became a one-day break because the airline changed the flight from the morning to the evening. It then sent several emails asking to bid for an upgrade. But on the day of the flight they didn’t bother to tell us that they had decided to cancel it. We showed up in the airport and were in limbo for nearly 24 hrs about when and whether we would fly on. At the end we bought new and more expensive tickets on South African Airlines to get to work on Monday. Didn’t get to see the Seychelles. Didn’t get our money back. And have yet to be able to reach anyone at Air Seychelles — the call center doesn’t appear to be staffed. Avoid at all cost.",,,,,
  Mauritius to Seychelles. Nearly ruined my honeymoon by cancelling a flight with only 3 days notice. Had to scramble to book / cancel hotels and transfers. Will never use them again and will advise friends and family not too either. ,,,,,
"  I purchased a ticket directly from Air Seychelles for Mauritius to Mahe In the end, I was not able to travel, and so I did not make the flight. I have been trying to get in touch with them about a refund (not a full refund but a refund of all fees and fares less some penalty), but all they did was send me an automated reply saying that they were working on it. I even tried to get in touch with customer service, whom I previously had some contact with about another ticketing issue. And all she said this time around was that she would refer my case to the ""appropriate department"", which never happened, as this happened in March and we are into July now. So in one word, avoid Air Seychelles!",,,,,
"  Johannesburg to Mumbai via Mahe. The staff in flight and at the airport must be the most unfriendliest you'll meet. For the entire flight of passengers there's 2 people at 1 counter doing the check in. Takes 45 mins. For a flight half full. The guy at the luggage scan asked us to make it quick as the flight is leaving as if it was our fault theres only 1 counter receiving check ins. There is no time in transit, you're shipped from 1 flight to the other. There is no place to smoke. But was advised by a guy that smoking in the toilet isn't permitted but allowed. It's the smallest airport I've been to with barely any facilities. Taking all this into consideration I see no reason why they should have an attitude. Flights itself are clean but outdated in entertainment. If you not fussy this is a cheap alternative. If you need to travel in some comfort pay more.",,,,,
"  Abu Dhabi to Mahe. Worst service we have ever encountered. We booked a vegan meal by email and received confirmation for both flights (return). On the first flight we were told that they had no food for us, as in they never received any food that is meant to be for us in the first place. On the second trip back, we double checked with check in staff about our meals and they said there was nothing mentioned next to our names on the system! we then asked them to add it again and they did while we were standing. Again on the plane we were told our names were not on the list to begin with so no food for us one more time. Food aside, we were moved to from an 8pm flight to 10pm flight without prior notice. Also, we knew other groups that were boarding the same flight as us by they were not shifted but they kept them on their same flight. Initially we were told it was due to system error and all 8pm passengers were shifted to 10 pm but if that was the case then how come we were the ONLY ones shifted?? Will never ever fly again. Also, many people in the airport were complaining about having their flights being shifted TWICE! Avoid this service.",,,,,
  Johannesburg to Mahe. I have never received such disgusting service as with Air Seychelles.  My luggage never arrived from Johannesburg and I had to deal with a rude lady in Mahe who told me my bag would be on the flight the following evening and sent to La Digue. They gave me a number to follow up on that when finally someone did answer they just said they don't know where my luggage is and put the phone down on me. They put the phone down on my mother as well. Surprise my luggage never arrived.,,,,,
  Johannesburg to Mumbai via Seychelles. Terrible airline to fly with. They will try to scam money out of you any way they can. Staff are extremely rude and unhelpful. Do yourself a favor and pay a little bit more to go with a reputable airline.,,,,,
"  Johannesburg to Seychelles. On the 4.5 hour flight the cabin flight attendants made only one trolley run with food and drinks, and that only after two hours in the air. By contrast, Air Namibia on a 1.5 hour flight do a drinks run, a food run and still a coffee tea run afterwards during the flight. Kenya Airways on a 4 hour run from Johannesburg do several drink runs in addition to the food run during that time. Air Seychelles cabin staff are not friendly and do not really care about the passengers. Its the worst service I have ever had on a flight.",,,,,
"  Johannesburg to Mumbai via Mahe, connecting to Hyderabad with Jet Airways. Flight was delayed in Mahe Airport for 4 hours then we missed connecting flight in Mumbai and we waited more then 5 hours in Mumbai Airport as they booked flights. There was no one to help us, it was bad customer service. Passengers were struggling to get the tickets for connecting flights. They made us to stood at counter for more then 2 hours, tickets had to be booked before we reach Mumbai Airport but they booked later we reached in Mumbai airport. Accommodation must be provided if there is a delay for more then 4 hours, but they didn't provide anything and didn't respond well in Mumbai Airport.",,,,,
"  Me and my husband had a horrible experience flying Air Seychelles from Mauritius to Mumbai via Mahe. Particularly poor was the flight from Mahe to Mumbai. At Mahe airport when we asked for a seat selection, we were rudely turned down. We could see other people standing behind us get the front seats. This was unfair and uncalled for. To top it off on the 4.5 hour flight from Mahe to Mumbai we were not even given blankets. When we asked about the blankets, the cabin crew told us that they had limited supply. Complaints to management fell on deaf years. All they offered were 5000 measly miles which could be cashed in on our next flight with Air Seychelles. Avoid if you can.",,,,,
" Not a good experience with Air Seychelles from Durban to Mumbai via Seychelles. Flight to Mumbai cancelled once we landed at Seychelles airport. Staff very unfriendly. stranded overnight. On return, staff had to be called several times to ask for blankets. No choice as to meal as meat was finished. TV screen never worked. Despite sending an online complaint, I still wait for a response. Their service seems to be very bad. No apology for the cancellation of the flight which affected our entire itinerary. I have completed the online survey and send a personal email but no acknowledgement or response. Will never use this airline or recommend it to anyone. I will stick with Emirates despite the longer route",,,,,
"  Seychelles to Mumbai. The worst flight I've had. After a 3.5 hr delay, they refused to provide any assistance and staff was too confused to help us at Mumbai. Would recommend taking some other airline rather than wasting your money on this one.",,,,,
"  Antananarivo to Abu Dhabi via Mahe. I have never experienced such a bad service! Lots of delays,mechanical problems with aircraft. No clear communication what was happening with the engine problems and updates so very stressy for all passengers to make connections. Very outdated aircraft. Problems with boarding pass issuing for many passengers while transiting in Seychelles! Frustrating with inadequate ground staff follow up! Halfway the food service some meals where already out of stock. Super rude check in at Antananarivo Airport. I have a silver frequent flyer card from Etihad which is their partner and normally my allowance was 40 kg. I arrived with a surfboard back and had to take out 8 kg as they said they only allow 32kg. My other bag was already checked in so i had to take it all as carry on.There where laughing and showed no mercy at check in-no humanity. I can't understand why a world class airline like Etihad teams up with them. This is island style aviation at its worst! Will take my business somewhere else. ",,,,,
"  Mauritius to Mumbai via Mahe. We had a horrible experience flying Air Seychelles. Particularly Mahe to Mumbai. We took Air Seychelles flight from Mauritius to Mahe - at Mahe airport for our onward flight from mahe to mumbai, when we politely requested to give us seats in the front of the economy - we were rudely turned down. How difficult is it to give 2 tickets in the front where in the tickets that were given to us were in the last and second last row - not even together - really unprofessional, unfair, rude. To top it in the 4 and half hour flight from Mahe to Mumbai we were not given the blankets. When asked about the blankets, the cabin crew told us that they had limited supply and they gave it to seats 6 to 15. The cabin crew did not even come and ask us about disembarkation form. ",,,,,
"  We had the worst air travel experience with Air Seychelles, flying from Antananarivo, Madagascar to Kathmandu, Nepal on 11/4/2016. We had two transfers - Mahe and Mumbai. We were treated like illegal immigrants and forced to stay at the airport overnight because the supervisor on ground in Mahe. We flew from Tana to Mahe. When we arrived Mahe, they refused to issue us boarding passes for our next two connections (Mahe-Mumbai-KTM) because we did not have onward tickets after Nepal. We explained that we are backpackers. We travel by land mostly and plan to cross the border by car from Nepal to India. The supervisor told us she will check and disappeared. When we asked about our flight, she said we still have time and she will not leave us behind. We waited in the airport until 9:10pm when our connection flight to Mumbai was boarding. By that time, we've purchased our onward ticket from KTM to Delhi as we cannot afford to miss the flight. We showed our ticket to one of the staff. The first thing she told us is we cannot boarding our flight because the gate is closed! Then when she phoned the supervisor, who demanded to see our India visa, which was completely irrelevant. We waited there thinking the supervisor will come back to us, but they just let us miss the flight like that! Even after we had all the documents they asked for. In the end, the supervisor never showed up and they did not let us board our flight even though we had the onward tickets. We were dumped in the airport without any explanation. We did not know why we need to show the airline our India visa while we are just flying to Nepal and what should we do for the flights that we've missed. When the supervisor showed up around midnight, she said we will have to wait for the next day to rearrange the tickets and just disappeared again. They tried to send us to a hotel but it was too late, the immigration officer didn't let us pass. Therefore, we were forced to sleep in the airport. The next day we spoke with numerous staff about our issue, including the supervisors and duty managers. None of them helped. In the end, we were able to board the flight that day withy the same documents we had a night before, which means we could've boarded our original flight! ",,,,,
"  Johannesburg to Seychelles. First time travelling with Air Seychelles and I was very impressed. Ground staff was very helpful. Food was excellent, cabin staff was friendly. The flight was comfortable and there was a variety of entertainment on board. Great airline would definitely recommend.",,,,,
  I wanted to bring to your attention the pathetic experience I have recently had flying Air Seychelles and its partner Etihad on the Mumbai-Dar Es Salaam-Mumbai route. I  booked a confirmed Air Seychelles Mumbai to Dar Es Salaam via Mahe return flights on January 2016 for July 2016. A month later we were informed that Air Seychelles has stopped flying that route and has shifted us to Etihad flight via Abu Dhabi. I confirmed with the Mumbai office of Air Seychelles and the flight was confirmed. A week before flying I checked with Etihad online and they informed me that my Abu Dhabi to Dar es Salaam sector was not confirmed. Neither Air Seychelles nor Etihad had taken the effort to inform me of this situation in spite of purchasing a confirmed ticket in January! If I had not followed up I would have been stranded in Abu Dhabi. The Air Seychelles ground office in Mumbai was equally clueless. Repeated emails from them to Air Seychelles and Etihad (on highest priority I was told) went unanswered. Only after I threatened to take action did they swing into action and book us on Kenya Airways. As a gesture we were informed that a special request for upgrade to Business class has been put but of course as expected there was no record on the system during check in. Also the complimentary chauffeur service from Etihad was not available as the PNR was 'not registered' in the system. The only explanation that I was offered was 'a system glitch'. This is irresponsible of both Air Seychelles and Etihad. I will definitely not be flying either airline. I would rather pay more and go by a more reliable airline like Emirates or Qatar Airways. Both Etihad and Air Seychelles promise a lot but once the money is exchanged forget their responsibility.,,,,,
"Uncomfortable, hardly any leg room and the cabin was so hot that it made it almost unbearable to be on the flight from Abu Dhabi to the Seychelles. However, on the return flight with Air Seychelles it was much better with a cooler cabin and much nicer staff. There were not as many passengers on the way back so we got to lay across the seats and sleep. Don't bother getting the front seats have don't have anymore room than the ones behind.",,,,,
"Abu Dhabi to Mauritius via Mahe. Previously the schedule and food were much better. One could leave around 9.20 am same day and arrive around 16.00 hours. Now, with Air Seychelles, one has to leave residence at 11.00 pm to reach destination around 12.20 next day, ie very odd hours. On top of that the transit time in Mahe, is now more than 2 hours. Seychelles has plenty of quality fish, yet the food served on both legs is appalling, only 2 breakfasts. Overall, only the dessert was good. It is preferable to pay partly for the food and obtain better quality.",,,,,
"First of all while booking online, only Credit Card payments are allowed - they don't allow netbanking or debit Card payments. No Option of changing your meal or seat preferences after booking. No Option to enter loyality Programme Details after booking. No option of online checkin - real shame who has design this Website. Before flying itself faced too much problems.",,,,,
"On original check in at Durban could check in baggage but SAA could not print Air Seychelles boarding pass. Re-check in at Johannesburg very slow with long queues, although very pleasant staff. Aircraft showed lack of cosmetic maintenance despite being fairly new such as loose seat pockets. Decent legroom and A330 seating configuration 2-4-2 preferable to Boeing. Service very slow after take off, first hour spent handing out immigration forms. Food was good but drinks, water or wine, in tiny quantities with no offer of refill. No walk around service after meal, although call button was responded to. Reasonable flight but do not be taken in by ""Creole experience"" punted on their website.",,,,,
"Flew Air Seychelles from Seychelles to Praslin Island. Friendly staff, but a tiny plane (as it was a 10 minute inter-island flight), so small that I couldn't stand up, but it was clean and new. The flight was smooth, and non-eventful. The seats weren't comfortable, and there were arranged in a two-one layout. The plane's livery needs a mention - it was one of the best I've seen.",,,,,
"Johannesburg to Praslin via Mahe with Air Seychelles. Our flight departure time was at 14h00 and the arrival time in Mahe very close to midnight. From Johannesburg the service was extremely slow as our trays were cleared more than an hour after the service commenced. I will not even comment on the food served as my tray went straight to their exit bin. The departure time from Johannesburg is clearly problematic if one considers the crew on duty had just come from Seychelles and with a turnaround of possibly an hour or less, they must have been on duty from very early morning. It would be interesting to know whether the same crew returns the aircraft or whether there was indeed another crew returning to Seychelles. If a different crew did duty on the return flight then their tardy service is unforgiveable. If the reverse is true, then surely their hours on duty exceeded the norm. For folk travelling from South Africa and seated in the economy class, sleep well the night before your departure. Do not try and extend your seat and then expect the passenger behind you to be happy having a stranger sleeping on their lap - when service starts you have to be asked to please place your seat in the upright position. On our return the menu was just as terrible - fancy being told they do not have the omelette which is first on their very fancy menu card and your choice is frittata or bread pudding for breakfast. The service was better, the crew were well trained but the noise from passengers and children was chronic, we at times wished their was an escape route and a parachute available. We have travelled to many destinations on various flights - longer flights do deserve the extra charges which we willingly pay, but never have we been so delighted to end our flight. Mahe Airport is in serious need of better seating and air conditioning - being the departure point from all the islands. Praslin Airport was cleaner and better equipped.",,,,,
"Flew Air Seychelles from SEZ to BOM. Purchased an upgrade at the lounge in Mahe Airport - handled in a professional manner. Seat comfort ok for 4hr 30min flight. Entertainment was Etihad ebox so there was plenty of choice. Dinner served was excellent - fish roulade, chicken curry. South African sauvignon blanc was good. Friendly efficient crew. wifi and sms available. On time arrival into Mumbai.",,,,,
We flew AUH-SEZ and return on Air Seychelles operated by Etihad Aircraft. The flights were both very empty with no more that 35 passengers on each sector. The flights left on time or even 30 minutes early as we found when leaving Victoria. The crew on both sectors were very friendly and professional. The quality of food was good on all flights and the crew continued to come round with water throughout the night. The entertainment was from Etihad's ebox selection which was very good and had an up to date film television and music selection on demand.,,,,,
We flew JNB to Seychelles on 21 April and back on 1 May 2015. The Cabin was good and the seat comfort very good - not completely lie flat but very close and much more comfortable than Emirates Business Class. Service is what you would expect from Business class. Outward bound trip from Johannesburg was good. Nightmare was on Inbound trip. The flight departure time was 8am but at around 5pm the evening prior to the flight they sent an email out to the travel agents that they have moved the departure time 1 hour earlier. They didn't contact the customers themselves and no one with authority at Air Seychelles was available to talk to. For people on Mahe the 1 hour earlier departure wasn't the end of the world but for people on the outlying islands who relied on a regular ferry service there was no way to make our flight and flights for next 3 days were fully booked. In the end we had to charter a boat to get us to the airport on time we were the lucky ones - others missed their flight completely. It seems that customer service is not something Air Seychelles understands. The flight back was uneventful except that 2 of the seats in business class were out of order and that the cabin staff were extremely noisy talking non stop at high volume throughout the flight. Sleeping wasn't easy but they just didn't care.,,,,,
I fly to Seychelles frequently and unfortunately as a Silver member of Etihad I fly Air Seychelles from Abu Dhabi to Seychelles. The services are terrible. Firstly they talk way too much all those announcements! From fasten your seatbelts to marketing their duty free it is in 3-4 languages. They start in English them French then Creole. Safety info presented in English and Arabic. Fasten seatbelts warning start with Chinese. The whole flight you listen to this nonsense. Entertainment system is very limited food is not great either. The most annoying thing for me is that as a Silver member I have never been able to upgrade with miles. They will not do it at the airport and even the manager on duty does not know how this is done I find it very annoying what is the point of being the frequent flyer then?,,,,,
Abu Dhabi to Hong Kong return using Air Seychelles. The journey was made easy by the service provided by the air crew. The food was nice there was a decent selection of drinks and the seats were comfortable. I would travel with this airline again and I would definitely recommend. I am a Gold card holder with Etihad and was initially dubious about flying with a connected airline.,,,,,
In October this year I flew AUH-HKG-AUH HM86 and HM87. Although slightly late leaving Abu Dhabi due to a catering issue the entire experience with Air Seychelles was brilliant. Although they were not particularly new A330-200 aircraft's and the entertainment system a bit old and limited I found the cabin crew quite possibly the best in the business. They were an energetic and enthusiastic crew working hard to give excellent customer service to passengers. The flights were not full on either sector so having 2 seats to myself was great and comfortable. After friendly chats about the airline with some of the crew in the galley I was brought champagne and chocolates to my seat a lovely gesture. Air Seychelles was a stark contrast to their partner airline Etihad.,,,,,
We travelled AUH/SEZ/AUH April 2013. The flights were both excellent. On time comfortable and with enthusiastic cabin crew. Even addressed by name in economy class!,,,,,
Possibly the worst mid haul airplane I've been on. Was booked through Etihad (superb airline) but got Seychelles instead! Frankly it felt like Ryanair or Easyjet. Give it the widest berth! I'll even avoid Etihad to avoid the chance of this tin pot airline.,,,,,
Flew JNB-SEZ and return. On both ways we had the same aircraft an older but very well maintained A330. The seats in economy are very comfortable and the service and catering were outstanding. Even the toilets were cleaned several times during the flight. Only the inflight entertainment could be better but I had my own iPad.,,,,,
Flights in economy from Johannesburg to Abu Dhabi via Mahe on 27 March. On time excellent service comfortable seating and adequate entertainment. Was a joy to travel with them and transfer at the Seychelles airport easy. Airport is old and small - just a short walk to plane - not much to do there but fine for transfer. Highly recommended. Disgraceful service.,,,,,
Travelled with them from Dar es Salaam to Mumbai on 23 Dec return 4 Jan 2015. Inflight service from Dar to Seychelles was awful. We had ordered chicken meals instead were given pasta. Because of the time factor and that they had only 2 attendants to serve 120 passengers they didn't respond to our call and when they did it was as if they were doing us a favour. Seychelles to Mumbai and back the service was good.,,,,,
After waiting in a very long slow que we were told that our flight from JHB to Seychelles was delayed 3 hours. We were given lunch vouchers for Jackson's or Mugg and Bean. Jackson's would not honor the voucher. Once again we had to queue for a long time before we could board the aircraft. We have a 6 year old and should of been allowed to join the front of the queue. Nobody from Air Seychelles assisted us. Immigration on Mahe are extremely rude and the luggage took forever to come through. After all the delay and run around they lost my sons stroller which was only found after all the passengers had left the terminal. No apology from any of the staff at the airport. Disgraceful service.,,,,,
Seats in economy are very comfortable with enough leg room. Unfortunately the staff are not well trained and rude. My airhostess required light was on for the almost entire 5 hour flight from JNB to Seychelles as I was trying to request a glass of water for my son eventually my husband went to the kitchen where they were standing and obtained a glass of water. When they served lunch they would serve 3 rows and then start clearing plates from the first row! That is how slow the service was!,,,,,
AUH-SEZ round trip on A332 great service very polite staff food was tasty and plentiful. You cannot check- in online but you can request a seat. Even though they received the plane last year it has old IFE has limited movies around 8 and few audio channels. Some screens were not working. They will receive another A332 this year wishing will have better IFE. Good experience I would travel with them anytime.,,,,,
We were due to fly at 19.30hrs the flight was diverted to Madagascar due to bad weather. We were kept in the terminal until 02.00am. None of the staff knew what was happening. They offered us food vouchers at 00.30hrs the queues for the one food kiosk were so large that it closed before all passengers could get their food. Staff did not give information and were rude. The plane landed from Madagascar about 01.00hrs but they didn't tell us they shipped us off to a hotel at 02.00am. The next day the girl at the desk just put our hand out for my ticket. No apology for the delay no smile. We ended queuing at Mahe for a further 3hours because they were unable to confirm our connections. Once again no-one giving water to passengers we were left like cattle just stood there. I have family in Seychelles but won't be going back until BA return or I'll fly Condor from Frankfurt next time.,,,,,
Service was excellent staff friendly meals were good. Boeing 767-200 was very very old. My son went to put his seatbelt on and it came off in his hand. The seat adjacent to that one had a table that wouldn't stay up. They do need new equipment but flight was otherwise uneventful.,,,,,
LHR-SEZ outbound in Pearl via Milan return in Economy via Rome. Very unique feel to this airline it's a small airline serving a small population plus tourists. Impressed by food service in both classes one of the best breakfasts I have had in Business Class and on the return offering 2 hot meals on a day flight was impressive. Staff were very friendly the whole thing did seem a little dated but in a good way. The IFE is still overhead TV screens with very lame films. The stops in Italy make the flights long but not too bad.,,,,,
We had to travel to France from Gatwick to catch our flight. Staff are warm friendly and helpful. I have never come away from a flight thinking how awful it was.,,,,,
I flew Air Seychelles (code share with Air France) Business class from Paris to Mahe. I regularly fly Business and I have to say on this particular flight the service was as good if not better than many of them. The crew were very good the service was excellent and the food great. Beds were 95% flat (not enough incline to notice). Even the comfort pack had organic creams and oils flower essences etc. I cant comment on the entertainment as I worked and slept most of the flight but I remember being impressed with the overall service from beginning to end. I flew again a week later again in Economy which seemed about average in comparison to other airlines.,,,,,
Paris to the Seychelles. The cabin itself is in good condition. the staff seemed a bit awkward and on the return flight was the entire crew were rude and arrogant. Food was as expected in the Economy. Despite seat reservation I had a different seat in the middle of three. I got no answer as to why my seat was changed.,,,,,
The planes were very old - on our return flight the notice about life vests was in Hungarian. We paid £1000 each to travel business class in conditions that might have been acceptable many years ago but came nowhere near what one expects in 2011. The cabin looked tired carpets and seats scruffy and cabin crew off-hand. The food was below par particularly breakfast on the home run. We were delayed 4 hours at Mahe in 80 degree heat waiting for an incoming flight from Zanzibar.,,,,,
I flew to Mahe from London Heathrow via Milan. Everything was done on time and service was excellent. Crew were friendly and took great care of my sick mother thought the flight. I really enjoyed the flight and will recommend the airline to anyone who wants to travel to the beautiful Seychelles.,,,,,
Originally booked our flight from Chennai (India) to Seychelles but were sent an email 4 weeks before departure saying this route had been cancelled and we were now flying out from Singapore. Air Seychelles paid the difference but we then had to fly into Singapore from Australia and lost the cost of our original flight to Chennai. We feel we should have been informed about this when we first booked and this would have saved us a lot of money. Apart from that we were pleased with the service of Air Seychelles. The service on board was excellent the food was pleasant and the comfort was of a superior class to many other airlines we have flown. Plenty of leg room and as the plane was only half full we were able to have two seats each. Personally we would recommend Air Seychelles to anyone but the flight to Singapore is only 6-7 hrs long so we have not experienced a really long flight. An enjoyable experience and we will definitely go the Seychelles again on Air Seychelles.,,,,,
In April 2011 we were booked Johannesburg-Mahe return. On the way to Seychelles we left with 3.5 hr delay losing all the further connections from Mahe to other Seychelles islands. On the return we arrived at the airport very early in the morning only to find out that the flight was cancelled and will fly only next evening. Did not care to tell us the night before knowing our location in Mahe! Disgusting indeed! They offered us to spend the night at the worst (and cheapest) hotel !The hotel was closed a month later because of sanitation problems even based on Seychelles standards. I complained to the Customer Service no answer at all.,,,,,
LHR-SEZ-LHR. It's true that there aren't personal TVs like on Virgin or BA but this wasn't particularly important to me - I'd rather read a book. The food was tasty and drinks are free. My only niggle is that it wasn't that clear that we would be stopping.,,,,,
Seychelles to Paris. A middle age Boeing 767 clean and seems to be well maintained. No PTV's which is now a must have. Seat pitch okay crew was nice and professional. The food was excellent aperitif was served with Champagne and all beverages free of charge.,,,,,
SIN-SEZ-SIN avoid Air Seychelles! After paying for my flight they sent an e-mail (without a subject even) to inform me that they've completely changed their flight schedule (by two days). This would make me miss my international connection back home to the US from Singapore. Now they refuse to refund my credit card and are offering me a bank transfer! And to top it off there's no form of compensation or assistance in any way. They have just left me high and dry.,,,,,
Very disappointing when you think how much they charge. We had a super holiday in the Seychelles but had to return to the UK on Air Seychelles. Delayed in Frankfurt for 3 hours the cabin was very scruffy and worn. Not recommended - they did not even have the courtesy to respond properly when I e-mailed my complaints.,,,,,
SIN-SEZ B767-200.Meal served very tasty. Aircraft clean and seats weren't too bad in terms of comfort. Flight only half full. No seatback AVOD but main screen showing movies on old VHS reel. Impressed with service and professionalism of crew. Water runs by crew through flight. Whilst not near the standards of larger airlines I was impressed with flight and Air Seychelles overall.,,,,,
CDG-SEZ-CDG Business Class. We traveled on the (only) B767 with the new business class seats (angled lie flat). These seats are a great improvement compared to previous Pearl Class seats. Outward flight on time inward flight with 1h delay due to late arrival of plane (from CDG) and slow boarding at SEZ (due to passengers having to walk in heavy rains on the tarmac to reach jet). Food and wine so-so. Nothing terrific but strangely enough on CDG-SEZ meals were not at all what was shown on the menu (staff apologized). Personal DVD players given for entertainment - provided adequate offering of movies. Overall a decent experience in Business Class.,,,,,
CDG-SEZ-CDG. My wife and I along with 200 other passengers were held up for 4 hours in the SEZ terminal for SEZ-CDG waiting for passengers to arrive from one of the other islands. The staff were totally incompetent in every way possible. The flight was held up because there was a problem with one of their other planes and Air Seychelles decided to boat them over to SEZ holding us all up. My wife and I missed all of our connecting flights and had to pay significant fees to change all of our tickets to get home 8 hrs later than we were originally planning to. Air Seychelles staff were useless throughout this process. They kept bumping the flight departure time up one hour at a time reassured us that things would be handled (which they weren't) and began to lie to us to keep us quiet. Every request we made to speak to a supervisor was completely dismissed and ignored. Their choice to inconvenience 200+ passengers for so few to cover their airlines obligations is despicable.,,,,,
LHR-SEZ-LHR for our honeymoon. Flight out was okay - 767-200 aircraft was ancient there were a scattering of CRT monitors showing three films which were difficult to watch without a revolvable head crew inattentive and bored looking. Returning on a 767-300 we were first in the queue for check-in because we we wanted to try to get exit aisle seats which we were told we had been given but when we boarded we found ourselves right in the middle of a section in the middle row. If we'd been told this when we checked in this I'd have understood but we were obviously disappointed to have been lied to. I mentioned our dismay to a crew member who said she would speak to the ground staff and get back to me but she didn't bother. Apparently seats are pre-allocated on the return leg so make sure you try to organise this on the way out. My seat was broken so wouldn't stay in the upright position much to the dismay of the person sitting behind me. There was a projector showing the film which would have been an improvement on the tiny CRTs on the way out but wasn't because the image had massive horizontal stripes running through it and the colours were completely out. The staff were surly and rude and mostly ignored you. I called for service and was responded to two hours later. They stood at the back chatting and you pretty much had to physically grab them in order to get their attention. The plane was knackered one of the films broke and had to be restarted and when the announcements were made the film kept playing so you'd miss chunks of it. The food was awful; the dinner like school leftovers breakfast consisting of grey-egged tortilla and chicken that looked like it had been condemned. The only benefit of Air Seychelles is that the fleet is currently so ancient the seat pitch is fair which I'm sure they'll change because according to the inflight magazine the fleet will be upgraded.. Their staff need some proper training and to learn the importance of customer service. Any decent airline would have sacked most of them by now. Very disappointed.,,,,,
LHR-SEZ-LHR Economy. Quite simply the worst flights ever. The plane did not offer the level of comfort we have come to expect from other airlines on long haul flights. Seats are uncomfortable and cramped and could do with reupholstering. IFE is of the old fashioned type with screens in the middle of the cabin. Film choice limited. We were sitting in window seats and because of the angle the screen took on a green/yellow hue. The cabin crew were bordering on hostile (both legs) and passengers were made to feel like they were an inconvenience. On the return leg one member of the cabin crew dropped a full food tray onto a passenger. She did not say anything at all to him and offered no apology (but she did go and get him some tissues for him to clean up.) ( The outgoing flight was nearly full but the staff managed to put all their belongings onto the back 2 rows that were unoccupied so that they could spread out when they took a break. Passengers were told that they could not use these seats. The staff had a major attitude problem on both legs. The food was virtually inedible. Customer services at Mahe - made a point of visiting the Air Seychelles customer services office to complain about the outgoing flight. On the 3 occasions we visited the office was empty. When we did finally manage to speak a representative they listened to our complaint nodded a lot never offered an apology. The day before we flew home we managed to speak to another Air Seychelles rep who was able to move our seats to the centre aisle and block off the spare seat to give us a little more space which is what we had asked for and was a satisfactory outcome. Still no apology though. They handed out customer satisfaction questionnaires on the return leg. I can't think that they had many favourable reviews judging from what the passengers around us were saying as well. Never again! Not a great start or end to our holiday in a beautiful country. We'd go to the Seychelles again but not with Air Seychelles.,,,,,
Frankfurt-Mahe return. Simply terrible. Arrived for departure with three small children and asked the staff for seats in the front part of the cabin. Finally they put us in the back of the cabin close to the toilets. All our five seats were broken in different ways; two of us had to sit on seats without the tilt working one seat where missing the foam inside the pillow and all the multimedia was a disaster - headset-contacts simply not there. And finally 4 hours waiting in Mahe due to technical problems.,,,,,
CDG-SEZ-CDG. Good flight with B767-300ER. The aircraft has a nice blue relaxing interior in Pearl class and service was okay. Inflight entertainment system very simple and not very good. Cabin crew good and replying on anyone's request. Food was better than expected. Seat was comfortable but not electronic powered. I heard Air Seychelles is going to have a new IFE and lie flat beds later in June.,,,,,
MRU-SEZ-MRU. The 767-200ER on this route is showing its age; I hadn't realised that cabins with a single video display still exist (making it difficult to see the safety video from the rear of the cabin). Visiting the toilet after the outward take off all the cupboard doors were open and the hand wash bottles were rolling around in the sink. The recline mechanism in my last row window seat was broken. On both legs cabin service was unenthusiastic. Seat pitch though is reasonable.,,,,,
SIN-SEZ-SIN. Used Air Seychelles as it was the most direct flight since travelling with 2 young children but now I wished I had travelled via the middle east. Air Seychelles staff arrogant and unfriendly. Asked for food for kids to no avail. Had to get up and fetch it myself. They had loud conversations with their co-workers across the aisle while serving food. Upon arrival to SEZ airport my youngest was sleeping on my shoulder and needed help with hand luggage while going down the stairs to the tarmac. Instead of helping they stood there and watch me like I was their circus act for the night. Thanks to a fellow passenger who came to my rescue! The Air Seychelles cabin crew really has a chip on their shoulder. Didn't look like they were very happy to be doing what they were doing.,,,,,
LHR-SEZ-SEZ. Our family trip was without incident. Plane was pretty empty on the way out so plenty of space to move around. Fortunately our flight was the first schedule for the re- opening of air space due to the volcanic ash. Plane full to capacity as expected. Cabin crew very accommodating able to obtain refreshments at any time.,,,,,
Heathrow from Mahe - 12.5 hours of hell. We had a seat that you could not tilt and I had a very sharp part of the planes interior sticking in my leg. I asked the stewardess if she could do something - she looked at me as if I had asked her to jump out of the plane and then gave me a cushion to put between me and the broken plug cover. So we had to sit bolt upright in these terrible seats with me having to try not to move or the cushion would fall down.. I have to say I was in tears in the end. I did notice there was another lady in the opposite seats to us and she was in a very distressed was too. Wrote to Air Seychelles hoping for an apology and an explanation as to why they let anyone travel in these most terrible seats. I have not heard a word. Very upset. Next time we will go with another airline and I will have no second thoughts about telling any of my friends to do the same.,,,,,
CDG-SEZ-CDG. Overall average airline that left me with mixed feelings. Outward flight delayed by 2 hours due to technical failure with chaotic (or no) information given (AF staff and Aeroport de Paris are responsible). Inward flight was on time. Smily and efficient crew on outward flight versus grumpy and unfriendly crew on inward flight. On both flights business class seats show their age and very old concept (no lie flat no electrical control). IFE is a joke (not on demand personal screens show only two channels) but crew can provide on request some DVD like personal readers with a (limited) choice. 5 movies that are on demand. Aircraft are old but food (choice of international and creole) and wines (1 champagne 2 red and 2 white wines) were good with a nice service of cheese and desserts. Unfortunately absolutely no service between meals on inward day flight. Beverages had to be negotiated with crew in the galley. Lounges good (but AF at CDG). To sum up decent aircraft with modern cabins are needed and some cabin crew need to improve their attitude.,,,,,
CDG-SEZ-CDG. Aircraft pretty clean and comfortable. IFE is very limited - 3 movies were screened all of them with a French soundtrack. Meals excellent and we were served champagne for the aperitif. Crews nice and helpful.,,,,,
"  This review is difficult to write since I was never able to actually fly with Air Tahiti Nui. The company recently had a workers strike that caused them to cancel multiple flights. The issue here isn’t the strike, it is how ATN handled it. Their response to the situation was terrible, with not only a lack of communication to affected passengers, but purposeful misinformation when you spoke to their representatives. My wife and I talked about taking this trip 10 years ago when we got married. We saved our money, spent the last 7 months planning, and then flew to LAX the day before our flight to PPT via ATN. Less than 23 hours before take-off, they cancelled the flight. They provided nothing more than general statements saying they were in the process of rebooking. Then nothing but silence. My wife called their representatives later in the day and were told that we would have a flight out THAT DAY and would be contacting us. Then more silence, nothing. Again called in and were offered a flight 4 days from now, cutting our trip on half. Absolutely unacceptable. We ended up not getting rebooked, not receiving any direct communication from ATN, and had to cancel our trip. If they had been more prepared for this contingency, as most competent enterprises are, they would have had plans in place in why to do when this happens. Instead, we lost our chance to go to Bora Bora. This experience was not unique with many other passengers having to cancel their trips due to Air Tahiti Nui's utter lack of planning and communication. My recommendation is to stay clear of Air Tahiti Nui. They may not be a problem for your trip, but their incompetence is readily apparent. If things go sideways, I don’t trust them to know what they’re doing.",,,,,
"  Air Tahiti Nui is absolutely horrible! My husband and I bought tickets from Air Tahiti Nui to go to Tahiti for our honeymoon. We had a connecting flight with another airline. My husband and I paid an additional $60 through Air Tahiti Nui so we could sit together on a 8 hour international flight. Due to a flight time change, our ticket numbers changed. Air Tahiti Nui’s system did not sync with the other airlines system. Therefore, Air Tahiti Nui lost our reservation and sold our seats that we paid for! Then, Air Tahiti Nui blamed us for changing our ticket numbers. I’m not sure how that is even possible to do on our end! After going back and fourth with Air Tahiti Nui for 2 hours at the airport, they found 2 spots for us on the flight. However, the seats were not together despite the fact we paid an additional $60 to sit together. Absolutely ridiculous! No wonder their reviews are so low.",,,,,
  The best airline I have flown with. Everything was as expected for business class. The seats were to die for! I actually slept and I never sleep on a plane. The flight crew was excellent and the landing was the best I’ve experienced. Definitely recommend flying with them.,,,,,
  I flew Air Tahiti Nui from Los Angeles to Auckland via Tahiti. I was a very comfortable flight. The meals were good and the seats were comfortable. I was sick on the flight and they looked after me. I will fly them again.,,,,,
"  This airline is unreliable. They will make you late, make you miss your connecting flight and leave you to sort your problems out at your own cost without any help. Unbelievable. It cost us an extra $248 to sort out flights because their plane had a technical issue. Their problem, their fault they admitted. They promised to compensate at the airport and then later using fine print reneged on their responsibilities. Of all the 20 international flights that arrived in Auckland the same day theirs was the only one more than 10 minutes late. They were 2 hours late. We were stuck for an additional 4 hours at Auckland airport before we could get a new connecting flight.  The plane was chocker, not a spare seat, they were getting the best part of $2000 a seat and they still couldn't find a measly $124pp to compensate us for their screwup/",,,,,
"  Their lack of care, lack of support and lack of customer service is monumental. My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary and heading to Bora Bora. Air Tahiti from LAX to Papeete and then on Air Tahiti (regional carrier) to Bora Bora. About 2 hours prior to our late night flight, Air Tahiti Nui cancelled the flight. The reason was that the incoming aircraft was struck by lightning. Understanding that safety is paramount and absolutely the most important factor of traveling, we understood that the aircraft had to be inspected. Keep in mind that Air Tahiti Nui only has like 4 aircraft in their fleet so it's not like they can quickly bring in a new aircraft. We were shuttled to an airport hotel at LAX and told to come back in the next day as the flight would now depart at 2pm. Back to LAX we went and learned that Air Tahiti Nui kept delaying the flight with no information or communication to the passengers. When a Gate Agent did appear, we were advised that they are third party employees and have no further details. All this while we were watching tape being put on the front of the aircraft where it was struck by lightning. After hours again in LAX, the flight finally departed. Upon arrival in Tahiti there was no one from Air Tahiti Nui to provide hotel vouchers (as the majority of passengers were connecting to neighboring islands and there were no regional flights out that late). There was a line of about 200+ passengers waiting for some assistance from one woman sitting in the Air Tahiti office! After hours of waiting we were put up in literally a dump of a motel for the night. Knowing that the flight was cancelled the previous day, why would they not have staff ready to assist their passengers as well as hotel vouchers for those stuck in Papeete. Take my recommendation, fly an alternate carrier if going to Tahiti. Their Business Class product was terrible. 2x2x2 seating on a 787 where others offer plenty more room. Inflight entertainment was very limited and food was ""just OK' but nothing I would expect from a flag carrier. Internet never worked and while flight attendant service was very cordial, it certainly does not make up for their lack of customer service. We lost nights in Bora Bora and I have written a letter to Air Tahiti Nui and the response basically was ""sh*t happens"". Air France, United, Delta would be the carriers of choice. ",,,,,
" We were a party of 5 in Papeete heading out for cruise when the Tahitian government shut down all cruises. I contacted Air Tahiti immediately to see if we could get a flight home. The shut down occurred on a Friday and we could not catch a flight home until the following Wednesday which resulted in 5 more hotel nights. Air Tahiti charged us $1,048.00 per ticket for the flight home in the same class of service. If we didn't pay the $1,048.00 per ticket, Air Tahiti wanted to charge us $90.00 per ticket to drop down a class. The Air Tahiti standard pricing between main cabin and business class in normally $3,000.00 per ticket, the class drop should have resulted in a refund. Do not fly this airline, they do not care about servicing their passengers and taking advantage of their customers.",,,,,
"  Truly disappointed with the service. Avoid at all costs. Had a family emergency and desperately needed to get home. Tried to change my flights and willing to pay. The tool for managing the your bookings online is not available. Confirmed via phone. Phone support non existent. Called 15+ times and finally learned that the call center is not authorized to make booking changes or buy new flights.  Drove to the airport office. Airport office is not authorized either to sell tickets or change bookings. Only accepted way is via email. Waited for three days already trying to change my flight. In the meantime, family member has passed away and Air Tahiti Nui was not helpful at all getting home. Will never fly this airline again. To top it off, my luggage was lost for 4 days when I arrived in Tahiti. When I received my luggage, it was damaged. Complete failure.",,,,,
"  My husband and I travel a lot internationally. I don't remember having as much trouble booking with an airline. Unfortunately, they are our only option, we booked thru American Airlines. Trying to get seat assignments was extremely painful. It took 2 days and 4 phone calls, totalling 3 hours. When I waited for an option for seats, it took over 20 min each time. When I questioned the agent, she wanted to give me the whole reason behind how ""much work"" this was for her. I said I 'm not really interested, let's just get on with booking the seats please. After waiting 40min, I lost my connection! How convenient! BTW, if you get seat assignments before check in, you must pay. We haven't flown yet, I'm not looking forward to it! If at all possible, I will not be using this airline again.",,,,,
"  When I checked in they asked me if I had a ticket out of the US and I said yes and showed my ticket to Mexico. They said that is not valid as Mexico is part of the US. I said that no Mexico is not part of the US, they even called the supervisor who said the same thing. They made me buy a ticket back to my country which I didn't want at that time because I didn't know my return date yet. I bought this flight with Qantas but when I arrived it was Air Tahiti. I had to buy the ticket in 20 minutes otherwise they wouldn't let me board. It is embarrassing that they don't know the difference between the two countries and argue with customers like this. If this is their policy at least it should be on their website.",,,,,
" Food: the food from a quality standpoint, from Tahiti to Paris, had nothing to do with being in Business Class. Seat comfort: having selected a six abreast configuration on an ultra long haul flight it is just a no sense choice. I was lucky enough to be seated on an aisle seat but for outboard PAX on LH & RH side, it is just a headache to get access to the aisle. This seat does not have enough personal belongings storage and feet area is just to narrow to have a great sleeping position. Lavatory: the airline decided to lock the forward lavatory exclusively to crew. It means 30 PC PAX + 30 PYC PAX are sharing only two Lav's near door 2. During these times when we must respect distancing, it is just impossible. This airlines needs to remember their revenue is coming from passengers.",,,,,
"  My June 20th flight to Papeete was canceled by the airline due to COVID restrictions. When trying to get the $2300 or so back, I made at least 15 calls to my booking company and the airline. Booking company said Air Tahiti had to authorize any refund. Air Tahiti at first said they would only provide future credit (illegal for flights departing from the US) and then offered a refund minus a $250 service fee per person. I eventually filed a complaint with the DOT and was told by the airline they had received it. Later airline said they actually had not received it and couldn't process a refund until the DOT complaint was received. What kind of customer service is this? The agents are basically instructed to lie and give people the runaround. Eventually had the charge reversed by my credit card company.",,,,,
"  I booked this flight via Cheapoair it was supposed to leave April 14, 2020. Then the Coronavirus hit. The flight never left for Papeete it was cancelled by the airline. I requested a refund through Cheapoair because Air Tahiti Nui said it was bought through Cheapoair. I dealt with Cheapoair who checked with air Tahiti Nui about refunding me my money. We paid almost $1500.00 for two tickets. I was offered a credit which has to be used by next year or I lose the credit of the two tickets to Papeete. I wanted my money back as I, like thousands, of others had nothing to do with the cancellation. It was a worldwide pandemic. I am told now that I can get my money back with a $500.00 penalty. The quoted amount to be returned is approximately $750.00 for a $1500.00 investment. Which is more than a $500.00 penalty. I have filed a complaint with the Dept of Transportation who frowns on this type of rip off. I will never fly Air Tahiti Nui or use Cheapoair for any reason. I am a senior citizen with a compromised immune system and am not sure when I will be able to travel due to the Coronavirus.",,,,,
"  I was flying direct to Papeete, Tahiti for a cruise that was leaving 10/5/20. However, due to Covid-19 my cruise got canceled. I purchased my ticket in December 2019. When I contacted Tahiti Nui they offered no refunds but offered to extend my ticket for 2 months until 12/2/20. They offer a year beyond date from purchase. So buying early only hurt me. I can't fly this year for obvious reasons. However, they gave my friend and travel companion a year from this December and she can use it by 12/31/21. She made a big fuss and they gave it to her. She only spoke up about herself only and not me. When I contacted the airline about this to the Service Manager  he said due to her circumstances being a single mother she was given this. Pure discrimination! I'm a retired senior on a fixed income but that doesn't matter. They refused to extend my ticket like hers. I wrote to the VP of the Company and never heard back. I lost 1500.00 and got rid of a person I thought was a friend. Please fly with an American airline if you can. ",,,,,
"  I booked flights through Air Tahit Nui before COVID 19. A leg of our flights for July 2020 has been cancelled by the airline, and they offered to change our flights to still fly on the same day, even though there is a ban on international travel (which they acknowledge). We have been told that if we want to change our flight to any other day, we would have to pay $100 per person per fight. Save yourself the headache and never book through Air Tahiti Nui. They are dodgy. We thought they were a reputable company but they are not. How can they expect us to fly why there is a ban on travel. Absolute joke. ",,,,,
"  The airplane was almost new and was in good condition. Departed and arrived on time. No problems with the checked bags. The seat back was a bit on the thin side (the new 'slim' seat design). Seat back video screen worked fine but the selection of movies, TV programs, etc. was rather limited but OK for a night flight. Food was good but not outstanding and it was served quickly after departure. Check-in at PPT started only about 3 hr. before departure. Cabin staff did an OK job but were not outstanding. As the plane departed at midnight most people wanted to go to sleep rather than anything else. Overall the flight was as good as or slightly better than flights offered by United Airlines.",,,,,
"  Los Angeles to Papeete in December 2019. One of the worst airlines I have ever flown in my life.  Not only are they incredibly rude, and very poorly managed, you should see the letter I got from their CEO - no CEO in their right mind would ever write something as stupid and rude as this - it is truly incredible Air Tahiti Nui does not deserve your business, fly Air France and/or United to and from French Polynesia instead.",,,,,
" Papeete to Los Angeles. We left for Polynesia just before Covid-19 blocked North America. Our flight had more than 150 empty seats. The plane was very clean, very welcoming, very colourful and the service on board was impeccable! But the 5 stars is especially justified with our return flight. We had to return to Canada long before our planned return and having bought our tickets through an agency, it was up to them to make the changes. It goes without saying that the agency was completely overwhelmed and therefore unreachable and of no help! So we called ATN and spoke to 3 different people, all 3 were kind, patient and helpful than the others! In the end, we were able to dodge our agency and modify our tickets free of charge, for the same evening. In these times of crisis, even the staff at check-in and onboard were very welcoming and helpful. Congratulations to the entire ATN team and thank you for your quick and efficient service! ",,,,,
"  
This was the first time flying Air Tahiti Nui.  My goal was to fly from LAX to PPT (Tahiti) then PPT to BOB (Bora Bora). The nightmare started on our flight from LAX to PPT. Discovered Air Tahiti Nui does not have a designated ticket counter so you can only check in 2 hours before flight departs. This caused an issue because in order to gain access to any club lounge you need a boarding pass. Our flight arrived in LAX about 5 hours before the LAX to PPT departed so had to sit and wait in LAX for 3 hours until Air Tahiti Nui ticket counter opened. By that time there was a long line of people and the staff at Air Tahiti Nui did not seem to care how fast they processed people. So we were not able to go to our lounge and eat and relax so we had to pay for our lunch and stand around because of very limited seating in the lobby of LAX. After checking our bags we went to the gate displayed on my ticket and on the overhead boards and on my flight app. Several people started going up the the gate ticket counter asking why boarding had not started with only 10 minutes before our flight was suppose to depart. No answers. Staff simply did not seem to care. Five minutes before boarding an announcement was made of a gate change to 153 which was about 1/2 mile away all the way down to the other end of the concourse. We ran to the the other end only to wait 1.5 hours to board with more delays and no explanation. During this time I talked to a couple the long time LAX employees. They stated this happens all the time with Air Tahiti Nui. During our flight we purchase exit row seats. The Air Tahiti Nui staff allowed long lines to queue up and use our exist row areas as acceptable areas for people to stand and stretch, causing people to step on our feet several times. We brought this to the attention of the staff but they did not seem to care. Service was touted a very friendly and a great Tahitian experience. Do not believe what they tell you and show in their slick ads. We had a similar experience on way back. Sorry but once from LAX to PPT and PPT to LAX was enough. There are a lot of other airline choices like Air France etc. I would look elsewhere. Hopefully this review helped describe our experience. Even more concerning is we did not find Tahiti the friendly place to stay either. Expensive, and not very customer service orientated",,,,,
" Auckland to Papeete. From unannounced menu changes to wine that although listed on the menu was unavailable with cabin crew staff who very conveniently ""forgot"" passenger requests, a very unprofessional service. On an Emirates scale of 1 to 10 (with Emirates at 10), this outfit rates a 4 on a par with Air Fiji. Never again!",,,,,
" Los Angeles to Papeete. We used this airline to reach Polynesia for our honeymoon. We read good reviews about this and that's the reason why we opted for this company for the most important trip. When we arrived at the airport in Los Angeles we found out our flight was cancelled without any previous warning. Reason: there was no pilot! Bad organinzation at the airport and had to wait hours in a queue and lost one entire day of honeymoon stuck in LA. Worst thing is that we had no reimbursement at all as the company is not European and doesn't follow any European rule for reimbursment as the flight doesn't leave or reach an European country. Won't use with company anymore! Much better to prefer Air France to reach Tahiti, as prices are the same, but customers are protected as I found out Air Tahiti Nui often behave like that.",,,,,
"  We were boarding on a flight by Air Tahiti Nui from Paris to LA going on a short trip. After an hour delay we were told the flight is delayed till next day due to a thunder striking the plane. We were located to hotel to wait for a flight next day. Next day we were told the flight is delayed for one more day. Overall we lost two days and there was no point to go to LA for us anymore, we missed everything and lost a lot of money. We didn’t go in a flight and asked for a full refund I didn’t mention other expenses we had due to this I only asked for a 2 tickets refund. We received the refund later but 150 were deducted. I emailed few times to ask for a reason? I received no reply. We lost so much due to this situation and all I was asking is give the money back for a ticket.",,,,,
"  Los Angeles to Tahiti with Air Tahiti Nui. Plane was very clean, useful little bag of goodies, (ear buds, socks, night visor, etc) Food and drink - wonderful. Far better than domestic US flights Staff very helpful / attentive - made a very long flight better! Well Done!",,,,,
"  Papeete to Auckland. Customer portal down September 8th and 9th, so cannot event put a complaint through, no email back from their customer service yet. I went to the Papeete airport at 6am for my 9am flight. Checked in, baggage, everything. As the departure time drew near, we were none the wiser on the delay. Finally 9am rolled around, and they told us it would be another hour delay. More and more time was added, and none of the announcements were legible. Finally they tell us the flight is cancelled. They make us walk out of the airport in the heat, and go through customs which took a very long time. Then, we were forced to cue in a line to find out when the next flight was available. Everyone waited in line for an hour. When I got to the front of the line, they told me it was up to me to find my own accommodation and that the next flight was 1am the next day - and to provide them with my email and phone (which I did, I also provided them with the Air BNB host where I was staying cell number). Luckily, they had a spare room at the Air BNB. I racked up a huge cellphone bill trying to get the car company to not cancel my rental, which, they did anyway. My host drove me to the airport the next day at 10pm. We get there to find the place empty, and security telling us that the flight was cancelled. I go to the Air Tahiti Nui office that is at the airport, and I ask why I was not emailed or phoned about this. She Shrugged her shoulders and said it was not her fault. I asked her what I am supposed to do, and luckily, the Air BNB had a couch I could stay on as every hotel was booked. I went back to the place, and awoke at 6am again. Finally on the 3rd day I boarded my flight to Australia.  I have traveled to a number of tropical island places, and I know, things work a bit slower on island time. But honestly, the customer service was rude, and horrible. I have never been treated so badly - and had such a horrible experience.",,,,,
" Paris to Papeete via Los Angeles. New plane which is nice but actually less comfy. The older planes where on a 2-4-2 seats set-up, newer are on a 3-3-3 set-up, which give you less room on your seat. Food is okay, poor choice of entertainment but great staff, really nice and kind.",,,,,
"  Poor experience from Los Angeles to Papeete. Due to mechanical issues on our previous flight we lost the connection so we were booked on next available flight. We have paid for premium economy, which was unavailable on the flight we were re booked for. We tried on the phone and in the airport to get an upgrade from Air Tahiti Nui given the fact that we paid for premium economy, we had experienced an emergency landing because of mechanical issues,we were celebrating our 25th anniversary and they had empty seats in business class. They did not try to accommodate us at all and kept asking for 1400 US per person. The airplane was old, seats uncomfortable, very narrow and entertainment was a joke with very little options and very old movies. On the way back we flew the Dreamliner which was a better experience but food was a disappointment.",,,,,
  We flew from Los Angeles to Papeete and back with Air Tahiti Nui. Both planes were very hot and the food was not good. You do not have your own air control like on most flights. It was a sweaty 8 hours.,,,,,
"  Tahiti to Los Angeles. Good service, but poor food. The Airport processing and waiting was unbearable. It took over an hour to checkin. Departure was delayed and the temperature had to be in the high 30’s. On the flight to Tahiti the second serving of food was frozen and we told the staff on board but they couldn’t have cared about that.",,,,,
"Air Tahiti Nui is basically the only airline that flies to French Polinesia. The business class is old, and the seat do not recline to 180°. It's a very long flight from any airport. I flew from Japan and it was a 12 hours flight. The aircraft is very loud, there is no privacy in the business seat. The food is really good and the staff are really polite. The entertainment is quite poor.",,,,,
"  Auckland to Papeete. A new Boeing 787-9, good spacious seats on Business class. We had a bulk seat 1A. Even though close to the galley I did not hear any rattling. Entertainment is very poor. This review is about the cabin crew on board service. It is appalling. They do the minimum at the cabin. No helping to set up your tray for dinner. No food order taken. They look fed up. I experienced their service to be rude, distant, unenthusiastic and Unfriendly. If you ever go to PPT fly with air New Zealand.",,,,,
  Los Angeles to Papeete. Terrible customer service. Our return flight was originally booked on 2/6 from Tahiti to LAX. They notified us that they cancelled this flight due to schedule change.They gave us the option to leave a day earlier of the next day. We had already booked our non-refundable hotel room by this time so we inquired if we left a day earlier if they would cover our hotel cost for the night of the 5th. Verbally they assured us they would cover it so we locked in the 5th. They did say however that we would need to file a claim online with them. Which we did. We eventually got an email that said they aren't going to cover the cost of our hotel and we would need to go through travel insurance for reimbursement. Too bad we didn't have a current travel insurance plan. We called to try to get compensated in some way so we requested a free upgrade to premium economy. They said they might not have room but will add notes to our reservation for the ticket counter staff to upgrade us if there was room. 3 hrs before departure we arrive at the ticket counter and they had no idea what we were talking about as there were no notes added. They called their supervisor and we were declined due to no available seats. We board the plane and lo and behold there must have been at least 20 open seats in premium economy when the doors were closed. Lie upon lie upon lie. The only nice thing we found about this airline was the plane was a nice new 787 and the flight attendants were very accommodating.,,,,,
"  On January 17th, 2017 me and my husband travelled from Los Angeles to Auckland, New Zealand. Our flight with Air Tahiti Nui delayed almost 7 hrs because of mechanical issues with the plain in Los Angeles. When we informed the representative about our travel destination is Melbourne, she promised no problem, we will taken care of you and rebook you to other flight to make sure you reach your destination. Of course that was not the case. Because of the flight delay we missed our connecting flight in Auckland to Melbourne. Not Air Tahiti and not Air New Zealand helped us in any way when we ask help in the airport too. Both airlines pointed their finger to each other. The bottom line is we had to purchase 2 one way tickets for next day to Melbourne; cost us $800 dollars and we had to sleep in the airport in Auckland. I filed a complaint with both Airlines and I never heard back from Air Tahiti ever. I sent the e-mail to them 4 times without any acknowledgment or anything. Also, I tried to call them for a follow up, but the person on the phone told me I can reach their customer service only by e-mail. Their customer service is terrible. If you have any other airlines you can use, use other carrier.",,,,,
" When booking my flight from Los Angeles to Paris, I was thinking about Air France. I came across Air Tahiti Nui as a quick and cheap departure option on Expedia. I wasn't too sure about this airline. When we got to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), we stood in the check-in line. The lady checking in our luggage was very nice and professional. As she was checking our passports and wrapping the badges on our luggage, she warned us about frequent delays on this particular flight. As she anticipated, we were delayed for about an hour or more. This was imperative because we had a shuttle service in Paris who had our initial arrival time and had to wait for us. Anyway, we boarded the aircraft and noticed that our economy seats were very small and tight. For an 11 hour flight, these seats were terribly tiny and uncomfortable. The inflight entertainment was very limited. The movie selection was limited and there wasn't a variety of genres. The positive aspect of this airline was the service. The attendants aboard the flight were efficient, responsive, cooperative, and professional. I can't think of anything else to say about the staff. The food onboard the flight was just like your generic airline food. It was cold, slimy, and disgusting. I recommend purchasing food and snacks prior your flight in the terminal. Overall, staff was great but accommodations and passenger convenience weren't well.",,,,,
"  Flew Papeete to Auckland with Air Tahiti Nui. The original plane we were to take had mechanical problems so we waited for 3 hours for another plane. It appeared that there was quite a bit of confusion with this and whilst waiting we noticed the very slow boarding and taking off process of other planes. When it came our turn, whilst all were on board it still took over a half an hour to count and recount passengers. The food on both flights to and from Papeete was substandard and in two cases inedible. The cabin staff appeared only moderately trained and made me wonder how they would perform if there was a problem. Tahiti and the surrounding islands and its people are wonderful. On a return trip I would select another airline. On arrival at Auckland airport, it took three hours to organise our accomodation due to missed connections.",,,,,
"  We booked Air New Zealand London to Papeete via Los Angeles. Flights from Los Angeles to Papeete are operated by Air Tahiti Nui. What surprised us that we were asked to check in at Papeete the proof of our flights Los Angeles to London while the flight was made in code-share with Air New Zealand. No online check in was possible, no seats were available by calling 72 hours before, but by miracle they were available at check in after getting the check in manager to assist. We kept our original seats. There is a limit to stupid systems. In short, an experience not to be renewed on Air Tahiti Nui. If this airline did not have the exclusivity on Papeete they would have disappeared a long time ago. 

Nous avons fait une réservation Air New Zealand Londres Papeete via Los Angeles. Les vols Los Angeles Papeete étant effectué par votre compagnie. Quelle ne fut pas notre surprise qu’on nous demande à l’enregistrement à Papeete la preuve de nos vols Los Angeles Londres alors que le vol était effectué en code-share avec Air New Zealand… Pas d’enregistrement en ligne possible, pas de places disponibles hublot en appelant 72 heures avant mais par miracle il y en avait de disponible au check in après avoir fait venir la responsable du check in. Nous avons gardé nos places d’origine. Il y a une limite à la bétise. Bref une expérience à ne pas renouveller sur Air Tahiti Nui. Si vous n’aviez pas l’exclusivité sur Papeete vous auriez disparu depuis bien longtemps. ",,,,,
"  Los Angeles to Papeete (Tahiti) return. Both flights left over one hour late. While we were waiting for the plane to leave the terminal at LAX, the captain announced that we would be delayed for an hour to wait on 25 late passengers. After waiting for more than an hour and seeing a few passengers board, we finally left. This must have been the plane that was not updated as is mentioned in so many negative reviews. The tv screen in front of my seat had so many lines in it was not worth watching. What was so disappointing was the service on this flight which was practically non existent. Cups of water were served in the same size cups used in a water cooler and two would not equal one measuring cup. I received two before the crew retired for most of the flight. Drinks were served to the middle rows and when I asked for one, I was told she would come back but never did. When I pressed the call button, it was answered 5 minutes later by a male steward who said ""what do you want""? He returned with my drink order which was wrong. During most of the flight, the stewardess would walk by so fast that if you said something to get their attention, they were already 4 rows behind you. Never once did I see one walking down the aisles looking at the passengers faces to see if they needed anything. The return flight also left over one hour late. The breakfast served included a sausage that I believe was bad. No cruise is worth the 8 hours I had to spend on each flight. I ended up bringing my own snacks and water to make sure I would have some on the return flight.",,,,,
"Papeete to Los Angeles. We really enjoyed flying with Air Tahiti Nui. The staff is very nice and helpful. The seats are colorfull, the screens are good quality with recent movies. Everything is free onboard. We really recommend this airline.",,,,,
"  I would recommend avoiding Air Tahiti Nui. Our outbound flight from the US was uneventful. The plane, however, was in poor shape, with threadbare carpet, outdated seatback entertainment (some flights don't even have screens), sagging seatback pockets and below average food and service. The flight was on-time, though, and we were headed to paradise, so we could overlook these minor issues, even though the flight cost, even for an economy ticket, was at a premium price point. On our return trip is where we ran into serious issues. There was a mechanical delay on our flight, which postponed our departure for 24 hours. We waited in line for 3 hours before we had the delay and rebooking information, however, and were told that there was no possibility of being moved to one of the three other PPT-LAX flights that Air Tahiti Nui had before our rescheduled flight left. They put us up in a nice hotel overnight, so we weren't too upset at spending another day in Papeete. We had booked all of our ongoing flights out of LAX on our own due to my wife and I parting ways after the trip and her complicated international travel. Upon getting to the hotel, I began the process of rebooking all of those flights, as we were given the new departure information the following night. After breakfast the following morning, we were feeling pretty good about everything, when I just happened to check the Air Tahiti Nui website to see if our flight was still on time. Nope, we were delayed another 9 hours, which then caused us to miss all of our rebooked connections from LAX. We did not receive any notification from the airline about this additional delay. At this point, Air Tahiti Nui really let us down. They did not rebook us on any of the other departing flights for LAX. They had no consideration for connecting flights. In order for my wife to make her destination in time, we had to reroute her on another Air Tahiti Nui flight to Tokyo-Narita. They would not apply any of the funds we used for the PPT-LAX flight, nor would they simply book her on that flight at no cost due to the mechanical issue. When we spoke to customer service, we had to find all of our own solutions due to their incompetence and lack of understanding. To top it all off, they were completely indifferent and unapologetic. To this day, almost one month later, we have not been engaged by their customer service department for reparations after repeated emails and phone calls. Based on our experience, I would recommend a few things: There are other carriers that fly to/from Tahiti (Air France, Hawaiian Air, etc). Look into them and see if they are an option for you. Take a vacation somewhere else. There are a lot of nice spots in the world, and while Tahiti is exotic and amazing, our poor air travel and all that followed totally clouded our experience. If you still decide to go, and to go with Air Tahiti Nui, try to book all of your air travel through them on one ticket. Or, if you are booking your own connections, be sure to have some flexibility on your US arrival (a day or two in LA on the back end).",,,,,
"Flew Air Tahiti Nui from Auckland to Los Angeles. Firstly the customer service is terrible and they can't change seats on a near empty flight because they are ""not allowed to"". Once on the plane I realised how uncomfortable the seats were, hard and no leg room. The service is terrible as they barely speak english and don't seem to care about customers. They served drinks once on the flight and would not get a coke for me so they just gave the terrible orange juice that was served with breakfast. The food was horrible. Entertainment barely works and is outdated. The headphones they give you are terrible and you can't hear anything with them. No space for items so I say you put your items in the overhead because you can barely fit an iPhone into the seat back pocket. I do not recommend this airline because of it's poor service and terrible seats.",,,,,
I flew Air Tahiti Nui in December of 2015 from LAX going to eventual spot of Bora Bora. The flight was good and the airline was punctual. Food was decent and we were fed twice on the flight. Had entertainment to keep you busy in watching movies and the cabin crew was helpful.,,,,,
"Los Angeles to Papeete with Air Tahiti Nui. Travelers beware! Reservation agents rude and unwilling to process cancellation within 24 hours of booking and website does not allow online cancellation. Plane was very old. The seat, arm rest, tray table and TV monitor buttons are worn or torn. Onboard service was cold and lackluster. This airline certainly cannot compete with world-class airlines. Fly Air France to Tahiti if you are looking for superior experience.",,,,,
"Our original flight was scheduled to depart at 4pm but a few days prior was rescheduled to 7pm. Imagine my surprise while eating a leisurely late lunch at a hotel in Los Angeles when I get an email message from Flight Aware that the flight to Papeete now was rescheduled to the original 4pm departure. We rushed to grab our luggage, grabbed a ride to the airport only to find out that this was wrong and the flight was not to leave until 7pm. They did not load the flight until 7pm and we never took off until way after 8pm as we all sat in the most uncomfortable seats waiting for the last passenger to arrive. I do not know who designed the seating but they are the worst I have ever seen in over fourth years of flying. As for the meal service, bring a sandwich and you will be much better off. What the TV screen tells one what will be served was not even close to it and was not edible. Also if you hold an American Airlines loyalty card the only way you will get mileage credit is to book this codeshare flight through American Airlines as Air Tahiti will not post the miles to your American account. Let the flyer be aware.",,,,,
Los Angeles to Papeete with Air Tahiti Nui. The plane was clean and very comfortable. I agree with a previous reviewer that when extended the seats were somewhat awkward to sleep. But I managed. The dinner they served at midnight was perfect as it was a cold chicken salad and light. The rolls were warm which was very nice. By this time all seemed ready to quickly eat and then sleep. Cabin attendants could not have been nicer trying to make us more comfortable. We fly home in two weeks and will see if we are still so happy with the plane and service but at this point would very much recommend.,,,,,
"The A340 was Nuku Hiva, the youngest of the Air Tahiti Nui fleet from 2005. Left at 11:30pm, the last flight out of Tahiti in 2015. The cabin crew had made the effort to dress up and decorate the aircraft to celebrate New Year which was approximately half an hour after take-off. Served champagne before take off and after the pilot announced New Year; nice touch. The seats are comfortable and have a foot rest, but, found that the angle when extended for sleep (ever hopeful) was a wee bit awkward to find a good position - not a huge problem though and I am a bit short. There is a lot of leg room which makes it easy when seats are upright to move about. As we needed to try to sleep, we did not use the inflight entertainment. The cabin was fresh and clean, slightly better than our outward aircraft on 16 December, although that one was fine too (Moorea). These were both night flights and therefore we didn't have much contact with the cabin crew, but they were pleasant, polite and efficient although perhaps not quite so at ease with passengers as we have found on bigger international airlines. The breakfasts on both flights offered hot food and continental. It was very acceptable and included fruit and yoghurt. No complaints, the airline did its job and we were comfortable.",,,,,
"Los Angeles to Auckland via Papeete. On Dec 21 noticed that Air Tahiti Nui published possible strike action by Pilots. On reading this I called Air Tahiti and was assured our flight would not be affected and we should go to checkin at LAX on Dec 22 with a scheduled departure at 11:30pm. The customer service rep then  asked if I wanted to cancel. I should have taken the opportunity. On arriving (Myself, wife plus 2 infants) we were informed the flight was cancelled and we were rescheduled onto Air New Zealand. There were 7 to 8 check in staff all congregating and joking among themselves. We were told there was an issue and we'd be scheduled onto another airline. 1 hour later we were told that we were booked on American Airlines via Sydney but had to run to another Terminal in order to make the flight. We did that, arrived at the American Airlines counter who told us that we needed a transit visa for Sydney and Air Tahiti should have known this. Also told us there were no seats and we had missed the flight. We ran back to the Air Tahiti counter in the previous terminal. Again staff just joking around, had no knowledge of transit visas. Spent next 30 minutes trying to get us on another airline. Qantas this time. We ran to that counter with one helpful staff member, checked in and Qantas sorted our visas. Stroller was lost in transit. Flight they placed us on meant a 9 hour wait in Sydney before our final journey to NZ. On check-in we were charged for our on lap infant but told that Air Tahiti would reimburse. On calling Air Tahiti I was basicially told to go away. Worst customer service in 30 years of flying.",,,,,
"I was concerned about this airline after reading many terrible reviews. My Air Tahiti Nui experience was the opposite and crew was friendly and very helpful. The leg room was better than most for economy. The food was ok. On each seat a blanket and pillow, plus a bag with socks, eye mask, ear plugs, ear phones which was a nice touch. They provided 2 meals and also offered food in the galley (sandwiches, drinks, soup and ice cream) nice selection of movies to watch also. ",,,,,
"Budget is a word that comes to mind for Air Tahiti Nui. The ""Bora Bora"" A340 plane is in need of an update asap. On board entertainment unit was small and quite a few were very fuzzy. Choice is okay but not like bigger players provide and the interface unit is via Wii style hand held unit. It is not an on demand service so when the movies start you need to be read.y Because of this it takes some of the gloss flying with them. Take a tablet, Mac, Laptop when flying Air Tahiti Nui to avoid disappointment. Also have a device that can last 9 hours as there are no charging ports. The other plane we flew in their fleet had a larger tablet screen and usb port for charging. The crew did what they needed to do but nothing more, unless you buzzed them or fly business class. Seat comfort in economy was more domestic than international quality and at 3 hour mark it becomes noticeable. The armrests don't fold right up out of the way either. Food - fussy eaters and kids take snacks as meals make par but that's it, and bread rolls need a chainsaw to cut them open.",,,,,
"Air Tahiti Nui is the worst airline I have flown, starting from the reservation process. The Air Tahiti Nui website is the most outdated and the customer unfriendly of any airline. My credit card was charged twice for the same transaction. The reservation agents are the most condescending I have ever experienced. They are unwilling to do their jobs and try to get you to acquiesce to their attitude rather than follow industry standard customer service. Onboard experience was just as bad. The hardware showed neglected maintenance plus obvious signs of wear and tear with dirty seat cover and tray table. The flight attendants were subpar in their service. I would never fly this airline again.",,,,,
"We had an acceptable night time flight with Air Tahiti Nui from PPT to LAX. The Papeete lounge was air conditioned and spacious. The staff on the plane were pleasant and the food and drink OK, if not high-end cuisine. No complaints from us.",,,,,
"That was our first, and hopefully last, experience with Air Tahiti Nui. Inflight customer service in business class was horrible. The cabin staff looking after us was unprofessional and rude. She didn't offer us any drink unless she needed to. Wasn't friendly. Staff generally were rude and not very welcoming. Food was very poor quality and we were wondering how bad it must be in economy. Overall it wasn't a good experience. ",,,,,
"Just arrived off an awful Air Tahiti Nui plane from Los Angeles to Auckland via Tahiti. The main issue was that the inflight entertainment is outdated - it is draconian. If you must fly Air Tahiti Nui, try and avoid the ""Borabora"" plane - unless you don't wish to watch a movie or play a game. The other planes are better, but they have poor seats that force your head forward. Very awkward. Every flight also boarded late. Not good enough.  My worst international flight.",,,,,
"This was an awful business class. Food awful. My seat in business class had metal exposed at the head rest. The entertainment unit was fuzzy. You have to watch the movie when they start, it as it is not on demand. The food was un identifiable as to what it was. They only have four planes, this was the one flagged Bora Bora. It had not been updated.",,,,,
LAX-PPT-LAX. Having read some of the reviews on here I was a bit worried about what we'd encounter on these flights. Both were overnight so we tried to sleep and made no use of the entertainment system. The aircraft interior was clean and well maintained and the crew were very good. Breakfast was decent. The seat is angled lie flat but reasonably comfortable. Both flights were on time and bags were off quickly. The only downside I could see was the high fares due to I assume lack of competition.,,,,,
We flew on April 7 and 14 back and forth to Papeete. While the airline staff were friendly and helpful sadly we had an older plane that was not clean and the seats were extremely uncomfortable for our overnight flights. A standard roller bag carry on will not fit in the overhead compartment wheels first and had to be placed sideways. They don't really weigh your carry on at check in but the weight amount of 22 lbs is generous. They didn't weigh or even notice our backpacks. The tray tables were dirty the bathrooms were not kept up during flight and the seats/floor were stained throughout the cabin. I brought Clorox wipes after reading prior reviews to clean off our seating area and felt better after doing so. The amenities were nice such as the overnight flight kit pillows and blankets which were a pleasant feature. The food was not very good at all cold and soggy. The best bet is to bring something such as a Powerbar if you are a picky eater. The movies on the plane were of a good selection but when flying overnight you don't have much time to watch a movie if you are trying to rest. The flight was bumpy both ways but the pilot was considerate in not keeping the seat belt light on for an over-extended period of time. My suggestion is to ask at check in if there are two seats together to transfer to if you are stuck in the row of four you will be much more comfortable. Row 43 (a row of 4) in the back has in seat tray tables so you can't lift the armrest if traveling with a companion and this is not noted anywhere even on Seat Guru. The airport in Papeete is under construction and it took over 2.5 hours for the two planes that arrived at the same time to clear passport control which made us miss the ferry to Moorea. In conclusion if flying to Tahiti again I would try to find a different airline when booking but would likely fly this one again if I had too as the destination is paradise.,,,,,
My wife and I flew Air Tahiti from LAX to Tahiti and back. We will never make that mistake again. First the interior of the plane was in poor condition. The seats were old uncomfortable and stained. The digital display (which was from the stone age) did not function properly and the resolution was so bad that I elected to just keep it off. Second the seating layout is awful. If you are not in a window section you will be crammed in the middle of the plane in a row of four seats. I flew for 8 hours fighting over the armrest with a total stranger. Lastly my wife reserved a gluten free meal (she has celiac) and she was given raw vegetables a rice cake and yoghurt for breakfast.,,,,,
Flew Business Class from PPT to LAX only 1 out of 5 planes is older and we had a new cabin. Seats comfortable food excellent service very good. Before Takeoff Captain came through the business class to great every guest personally. If I get the same service every time I would most definitely fly with them again. They are as good as some major Asian Airlines and Miles better than any US Airline I flew recently.,,,,,
Terrible service. Food was better in economy. Seats were awful - unable to adjust it so you could get comfortable and we are 5ft and 6ft so it should have worked for one of us. Headphone socket broken so unable to watch movies or listen to music. Staff just said 'we can't fix it in flight'. Movies NOT on-demand and you are not informed when they start. Definitely not worth the extra. This was AKL-PPT. Go with Air NZ instead.,,,,,
Round trip LAX-PPT last 2 weeks of 10/14. Flight out was an old aircraft inflight entertainment was awful. Video worse than your 1957 TV. Service and food ok+. Flight back was newer aircraft and entertainment display was good but content severely limited. Gate agent in PPT refused the check through in domestic USA via the post customs LAX baggage transfer service. She was inflexible and rude about it. They advertise in their magazine they have a deal with Alaska Air my domestic carrier. Alaska in LAX confirmed the deal and that AT was erratic in conforming to the agreement. Moving baggage around LAX isn't fun. Very poor treatment of a business class customer.,,,,,
Booked C class round trip LAX-PPT. Did not like the previous reviews so I was a little apprehensive. Also as I understand it only 3 of their 5 aircraft have the new C class. As is turned out the new seats were very adequate. At 20.5 they are a tad tight and they do not fully recline. Nonetheless my wife and I were able to sleep most of the way on a long late night flight. Staff were gracious and professional. Food and drink were very adequate but nothing special. All in all a good experience. Tahiti is a very special place and this is as good as it gets.,,,,,
Flew from CDG to LAX (return) in late August 2014 / early Sept 2014. Awful customer service. The check-in-staff have absolutely no warmth or charm and made no attempt to fulfil my seat request; they were quite abrupt in refusing it moreover. In-air-staff are likewise very poor. Aircraft was old and seats are inadequate. I will never use this airline again. I often travel on Asian airlines and Air Tahiti Nui is way way below par.,,,,,
LAX to Papeete business class: terrible. Where to start: Old seats straight from the 90's bad shape seats an entertainment system with 4 movies and bad screen quality. Bland food and to top it all magazines which were 3 weeks old. Flight attendants are nonchalant to say the least and you don't see them unless you hunt them down. Forget snacks. Just awful and way below par any other airlines.,,,,,
"AKL-PPT-LAX-PPT in economy May 2014. Air Tahiti Nui only have five A340 aircraft. We flew on three of these - all were different experiences. The first leg AKL-PPT was on ""Moorea"" which had an upgraded interior and felt very new and fresh. Leg room seemed adequate for economy however as others have said previously the seat designer should be sacked! The head rest is not ergonomic at all and causes discomfort. The is also no lumbar support. I packed the seat back out with pillows to help. The crew were young friendly and worked the cabin non stop. Food on all flights was edible if not slightly odd - the seat designer must have had input in the menu as well. Entertainment on demand comprised of about 10 of movies (some recent releases) and TV shows. The second flight an 8.5 hr overnight flight from PPT-LAX was on ""Nuku Hiva"". This aircraft was also retrofitted with the new interior however it felt older. tired and there was a noticeable decrease in leg room despite us being in the same seat number on both flights. The crew were a bit surly and disappeared after trolley service. Again the seats weren't that comfortable due to the awful head rest and lack of leg room. Our third flight overnight from LAX to PPT was on ""Bora Bora"" which has yet to have it's interior retrofitted. The seats were much more comfortable than the newer version in economy as they lacked the offending head rest but the entertainment is on the old loop system rather than 'on demand'. Would I fly them again? Only if the price was right (we scored half price tickets) - you only get what you pay for!",,,,,
The seats were so uncomfortable I was dreading the flight home. There was no lumbar support and the add on headrest pushed my head forward putting my neck at a very unnatural position. I could not get comfortable using pillows and blankets or in any position. It made for a very long flight home.,,,,,
Loved this airline except for one problem. They changed our return flight from Auckland so we had to layover for the night. We did not appreciate this change. It cost us a lot more money to stay in a hotel for one night in Tahiti. It made the trip much longer. The flight to Tahiti didn't get in until 9.45 pm and customs took forever. Then we had to be back to the airport by 6 am. If they had to make this change they could have at least left earlier so we wouldn't have had such a long night.,,,,,
March 29 PPT TAHITI FRENCH POLYNESIA - LAX LOS ANGLES CA. The flight was horrible. After spending a great deal of money for a business class seat I literally had to get up and go and find flight attendants to get a drink of water after not seeing them for a 3 hour stretch. The food was terrible as well. Not worth the money! Horrible service.,,,,,
"Seats are incredibly uncomfortable and service was ok but nothing spectacular. I reacted to something in the air and my eyes started watering and I couldn't stop coughing. I pushed the service button waited 20 minutes and the attendant finally came turned it off and walked away! I cannot stress enough how uncomfortable the seats are especially for tall people. My husband is 6'1"" and I'm 5'9"". We couldn't move and didn't sleep the entire flight down or back. If there was another way to get to Paradise we would definitely take it!",,,,,
Flew LAX to PPT and back for an Oceania Cruise. Going to PPT things were just OK. After all you are heading to paradise so it's easier to overlook less than friendly service uncomfortable seats and marginal food. Our return flight was a charter arranged by the cruise line and things were much worse. They had little or no ice limited beverage options and the food was awful. The flight attendants just don't have any spark to them. Some of that may be a cultural thing because I find customer service in FP to be less warm and inviting than in Europe or the US. This airline needs to really punch up their customer service.,,,,,
I flew round trip to Papeete for a Paul Gauguin cruise. I will never fly that airline again. This is unfortunate for French Polynesia because it is a wonderful place and I loved my time there the the flight was unbearable. The seats are so small with no leg room so that one can hardly move. The country should subsidize the airline or another one so that passengers can visit this beautiful place without the pain associated with getting there.,,,,,
Flew LAX to Tahiti seats 19K/L with my wife on 23 Jan 14. Both of our entertainment systems did not work. Asked the flight attendant 3 times about it and was ignored. Finally a flight attendant indicated they could sit us in separate seats or two middle seats in the last row.,,,,,
A 5-hour flight from Auckland to Papeete (Business Class) was more or less ruined by a seat that wouldn't budge from the takeoff/landing bolt upright position and a fold out tray that didn't. The whole aircraft was looking very tired and tatty and badly in need of an upgrade. The Air Tahiti staff at the chaotic boarding gate in Auckland were rude and condescending although the flight attendants did the best they could in such a worn out old bus. Food was OK (I don't expect cordon bleu on a plane) but the wine choice was one cheap red or white. Take it or leave it. Entertainment was very limited too. I was told that of a fleet of 5 aircraft 4 have in fact been upgraded. I guess I found myself on the one that wasn't. Assuming the final aircraft is in fact given the major facelift it so badly needs then I'd consider using Air Tahiti Nui again as a last resort but will take Air New Zealand if it's an available alternative.,,,,,
AA 7176 (code share) on 1/15/14 Papeete to Los Angeles. Business class on this airline was very disappointing in comparison to other airlines we use. Because our tickets were code share we were not allowed in the business class lounge despite paying for business class fare.,,,,,
Air Tahiti Nui economy class is awful - very tight cramped seats if you are tall as we are poor service and minimal cardboard food. Our section of the cabin was an oven the section behind us was a refrigerator and the cabin attendants seemed to be unable to do anything about it when you could find one to ask. My husband who is 6 ft’3”was wedged into his seat to the point that the woman in front of him and the woman behind him both complained when he moved and he was unable to sleep at all. We upgraded to first class on the way home and the leg room service and food were very good but they still locked the forward toilets for most of the flight and half the reading lights did not work. We will never fly Air Tahiti Nui again.,,,,,
Very poor service at LAX from Air Tahiti staff. Flying business class on AA with a code share. They are having some dispute with AA so AA and Air Tahiti are refusing to let each other's business class passengers into their lounges but they don't tell you until you get to the lounge. With three small children and already on flights for 12 hours with a 6 hour stopover in LAX they refused us entry to the Lounge. The staff in the Lounge were kind. Air Tahiti wouldn't let us pay for the lounge without first going out of security again waiting 30 minutes for them to process the payment and receipts and then line up in security all over. Apparently they used to let people phone in the credit card number to avoid having to exit security but now they have decided they rather make passengers spend over an hour at their desk/security. We'll avoid Air Tahiti and AA for a long time.,,,,,
Excellent service from the flight crew and ground crew. We arrived at LAX with minutes to spare as our inbound flight was delayed 2+ hours. That airline made no effort to put us on another flight. Running all the way from Terminal 1 to Bradley searching for the ATN desk the kind young lady escorted us swiftly to the gate. We just made the flight otherwise would have spent the night in LA. Although our bags didn't make it they were delivered the next day to our hotel. Since we had no luggage when we arrived the airline gave us a nice bag with essential toiletries including T-shirt and shorts which we all sported for the next few hours. The meals were better than expected the in-flight entertainment was better than some major U.S. airlines. The waiting area in Papeete for our homebound flight was fabulous beautiful shops food comfortable lounge chairs gardens.,,,,,
"Flew to Auckland from Papeete. The flight was 5 hours long. I was seated in 6a wonderful smells of the toilet behind us. I found cabin staff rude and unfriendly. They closed business class toilet and told everyone to use the ones in the middle of the plane. They dropped food on my lap while serving bread didn't say sorry but offered me another one. Seats are average for business class and food is terrible. They were ""out"" of mains when they came to serve us (being in row 6). You do not get additional drinks and if you go and ask for some it's an inconvenience to the staff without a smile or polite conversation. I might sound picky but I am simply wanting something nicer than economy when you pay twice as much for a ticket. The entertainment gave you 8 new movies and a few old titles and tv programs. The seats recline but I am six foot so my feet hang off the edge. If you are travelling by yourself there is no privacy screens like Emirates or Singapore airlines.",,,,,
We flew from LAX to Papeete and back. We were in a recently remodelled plane but the seats were terrible. They were tightly packed with very little leg room which is the norm. However the back was curved into a concave shape which was agony on a 8.5 hour flight. The headrests exacerbated the problem and my wife's wouldn't even stay up. The cushions were also stiff. There was no power outlet for the seats.,,,,,
Fight from LAX to PPT. After a full day of US flights from RDU to MSP to LAX we were quite exhausted. A couple of those flights were late and the older planes were packed. So we were hoping for a change of pace on our 8.5 hour flight from LAX to PPT - and we were not disappointed! The A349 was impeccable. We were in coach but the seats were roomy the flight staff was extremely friendly and we had brand new inflight entertainment systems (I think the entire cabin had recently been redone). The experience got our first trip to French Polynesia off to a great start. Yeah it's still tough to sleep in coach seats but the great experience made it bearable. And of course there's nothing like waking up having a good French breakfast and landing in Tahiti with the anticipation of a luxurious vacation ahead! You really have no other options for flying to Tahiti but who cares - Air Tahiti Nui rocked it!,,,,,
Flew economy round-trip Los Angeles - Papeete. Flights on time on nice aircraft. Economy seating is good and inflight service was excellent. Although aircraft are the same on the return flight got an aircraft that had been reconfigured with their new seats and touch screen videos and was quite nice.,,,,,
TN 102 PPT-LAX 3/16/2013 Economy Seat 27B. Departed PPT 15 minutes late for no apparent reason. Told we could not check luggage through to DFW. Entertainment screen control did not work properly - also controls overhead reading light. We were skipped for our dinner initially. Attendant seemed bothered that we asked for dinner. Dinner was inedible. Cold slices of meat hard as shoe soles bread that could not be cut. Asked for Diet Coke was told only water was available. Arrived in LAX 15 minutes late. Still had 3 hours to make our connection to DFW. Over an hour before our luggage was available to go through customs. Because we could not check the luggage in PPT had to carry our luggage from the International terminal to AA. Only in LAX does a 3 and 1/4 hour connection become a nail biter we have always had problems at LAX making connections.,,,,,
My luggage was received two days late in Papeete. Reason: The aircraft was already overloaded when my connection flight from Sydney arrived Auckland. My luggage remained in Auckland that day. On arrival in Papeete there was no assistance at all to passengers without luggage. There was only one person (for about 30 passengers) recording the missing luggage and it took after a late arrival another two hours before we could leave the airport to get some sleep. There was no apology from the airline. The return flight was four hours delayed and the waiting time in Papeete airport was hell. We had to pay for very expensive airport food. WIFI connection did not work and informing relatives about late arrival was impossible. There was little to no information on the reason and what the measures would be and no help from the ground staff. It almost appeared like a cover up. We missed our connecting flights and had later been booked to other flights. Again information was not available from the cabin crew during the flight and only in Auckland we where told to what connecting flight we had been re-booked. A very troublesome check out and check in with going through the immigration twice in Auckland had to be endured.,,,,,
LAX to PPT on TN101 and returned a week later on TN18. Boarding at LAX less then enjoyable. Sent first to one gate then to another. Don't know if the airline or LAX is to blame there. Once boarding started we were put on buses to go to a satellite boarding point. Main terminal under construction. Inconvenient but it works. Onboard cabin staff were friendly and helpful. First time on an A340. Once in the air the flight went smoothly. The plane was clean. The 2 meals served were adequate in size and somewhat above average as far as airline food goes. Service was good. A red-eye flight in economy class seats is not going to produce quality sleep. The seats were about as comfortable as you would expect which isn't saying an awful lot. Entertainment system was marginal. I never expect much when flying economy but the service and meals were better than expected. Outbound flight departed and arrived on time. Return departed and arrived early. Our bags arrived when we did.,,,,,
TN 102 from AKL to PPT over last weekend. A very full flight. Punctual in terms of Departure and Arrival. Was given a seat in the last row despite checking in 3hrs in advance. Seat comfort was good. Staff were a mixed bag. Some were exceptionally friendly whilst others gave the impression they would be somewhere else. IFE was non AVOD and lacked choice and content. Food and Drinks were good and plentiful.,,,,,
LAX-PPT Business Class. Great ambience nice tropical feel as soon as you step on the plane. Normal modern business class seats (not the newest 100% recline ones but plenty of leg room and comfort). Food was very good as well. I recommend flying with them.,,,,,
Seats are showing some wear and tear. Torn at points and armrest cover hinges feel stuck at times. The entertainment controls on the armrest are worn-out yet still functional. Adjustment of seats: they lack sufficient recline. Controls are placed at hip level inside the chair so poorly accessible. Putting 2 pillows under your feet to raise them makes it better but raising the feet with a pillow will put your toes up against the back of the reclined seat in front of you. I deliberately chose a middle section seat this allows you to always exit without climbing over or being climbed over. The seat rows are that close together that undisturbed passing is impossible. The lumber supports do not work on this flight. Flight entertainment system is Archaic. You don't have the option of starting your movie on demand. The quality of the LCD screen is best described as a snowy CRT up close. The movies continue during PA announcements and since all are continuously playing there is no chance of rewinding. There are no air vents above the seat only general air conditioning. No power output in business class. This is consistent with the age of the seats. Sufficiently equipped courtesy pouch with toothbrush and paste eye covers ear plugs and socks. Headphones supplied are comfortable for the first couple of hours. There was simply no noise cancellation. Service is attentive and correct although the personal touch was missing the second flight. Timely serving and offering of drinks.,,,,,
LAX-PPT in Business Class. Business Class departure lounge in LAX shared with several other airlines. Nice lounge with free snacks and drinks. Boarding gate was a bit far away we were bussed to the aircraft. First and Business Class customers were boarded in a separate bus. Once onboard - very comfortable. Before take-off drinks offered. Several uniform changes during the 8.5 hour flight. Our flight left LAX on time. As previously noted - business class seats do not fully recline and when you do recline - it protrudes in to the space of the person sitting behind you. Not the best lay out - but certainly adequate. Good meal service and friendly/attentive flight attendants. Return PPT-LAX - same on time departure and arrival and good inflight service.,,,,,
"Scheduled to fly non-stop Paris-Los Angeles. At the check-in counter the sign said 'New York' we were told the flight to LA was simply making a quick stop in New York then would continue to LA. This was a lie. Upon arrival in New York we were told it would be 24 hours until another plane would take us to LA. They put us up in a hotel. 24 hours later it was a charter flight they put us on to LA. I complained to Air Tahiti Nui about the lack of meal and I was told ""we went to a very big expense to charter this flight you should be grateful"". I should be grateful they arranged me transportation to where I paid to go?",,,,,
Paris CDG to Los Angeles. Good food crew entertainment and leg space. I enjoyed the whole island theme that was experienced onboard. A plus about the entire experience was the level of visibility and attention the crew provided with frequent water runs and prompt responses to call bell. Another feature was the snack bar set up at the galley for passengers. Flight departed and arrived on time.,,,,,
LAX-PPT-LAX over Christmas and New Year. Both trips were red-eyes. Outbound from LAX check-in was cheerful and set the tone for the journey. On the down side passengers are bussed to the aircraft and ATN staff lost complete control of the process resulting in a scrum to get on the busses. Onboard we passed on the meal offering and slept. The hot breakfast was welcome. Arrivals Hall was chaos and a 1 hour delay to get through Immigration awaited us. Returning the Departures Area is new spacious but very warm. Boarding went well as our seats were in Row 44 we made our way to the desk 10 minutes before boarding to avoid the chaos we experienced outbound at LAX. Once again pleasant and efficient crew. In summary our flights were good the only warning I would make is that in Economy the seat pitch is only 31 inches and on an 8 hour flight if you are over 6 ft tall this is not comfortable at all.,,,,,
Flying 3/4 times every year since 2008 my last experience was very disappointing. Besides domestic there is no traffic during the day at Papeete Faaa airport and then late at night they schedule 3 international flights all due to leave within a short hour and this airport can't handle it. I arrived 4 hours before departure and the line for check-in immigration and luggage check were endless. I was booked on TN8 seat 11A to Paris via LAX and after pulling out we came back to the parking stand because of an engine problem. We were told it would take an extra 3 hours to change it. They decided to serve us the light cold snack. The previous times I flew we used to have a full hot meal with wine it is obvious ATN is cutting costs and service. Finally airborne 4 hours behind schedule we were expecting to be served a round of drinks but nothing on this 8 hours flight until an hour before touching down in LAX they served us breakfast. The 11 hour flight to Paris went without problem but no round of water or drinks served between lunch and breakfast. Unfortunately due to the monopoly ATN has on these routes I will have no choice but to fly with them again.,,,,,
LAX-CDG and CDG-LAX several times in past 3 years. I appreciate the little flower they give when entering the plane. On the latest trip staff walk through the cabin several times through the flight but the call light was ignored or they were too busy with helping someone else. I never did like plane food so this one was no different. Person sitting in front of me had their seats reclined right back so it was hard to place my food on the tray. The steward serving food saw and told him to put his seat up.,,,,,
Los Angeles to Paris return. We boarded our flight with high expectations however we were sorely disappointed. While others could check 2 pieces of luggage free we were allowed only one. We had been told to expect seats that were roomier with more leg room than other airlines but we were as crowded as on any low-cost airline. Onboard the service was poor and the food quality was poor. Attendants came down the aisle infrequently to offer snacks. The flight itself was fine and on-time but we agreed we would not fly this airline again.,,,,,
Onboard the air conditioning was broken and the pilot would not turn the engine on as there was another malfunction with the luggage loading. We left over 1.5 hrs late and missed our connecting flight back to Boston. Another rude service counter agent would not help us they would not provide us hotel voucher as it was not there fault or problem. I noticed a terrible attitude problem when enquiring.,,,,,
LAX-Tahiti. We were informed by our travel agent about the strike and had to switch out flight from LAX-Tahiti. When we got to LAX we had to wait 3 hrs in line before we could get our boarding passes. We received very little information regarding the delay. The service agents stood there and looked at you but had no answers. This was a horrible experience. The best part of the night was when the Air New Zealand crew showed up. They chartered Air New Zealand to take us to Tahiti. That crew and flight was wonderful. On the way home from Tahiti the strike was over so we had Air Tahiti Nui for the flight home. The service on the fight was horrible. If you put on your call light they would ignore you.,,,,,
Paris-LAX The plane was immaculate staff friendly and food was fabulous! We were given a menu two hot meals and snacks during the flight. If we needed something else we were able to go to the galley and ask for ice cream or drinks at no charge. It was a long flight from Paris to LA but it was very comfortable and didn't feel like 12 hours because of the service.,,,,,
"CDG to LAX. The cabin was very cramped and hot throughout the flight but service and food was quite good and a real surprise after our experience on the ground. We arrived two hours ahead of time at CDG. After it took over an hour (about 75 minutes) to check in we then got in line next to go through security. After waiting about 30 minutes and becoming very concerned about them shutting the doors before we got through I asked the now idle check-in people if there was a way to get us through so we would not miss the flight. The manager very dismissively told us to get to the back of the line there was nothing he could do. After another 20 minutes with a security agent telling us to just have an airline rep walk us to 1st class line and being told again by the to just go back to the end of the line a security agent walked us to another area and through 1st class line. We were very surprised when we got onboard to see the same inept and rude people who did check-in were the first class and business class stewards. All they had to say to us when I said I was worried about missing the flight was ""We know you are here checked-in and in line for security. We won't leave without you."" Instead rudeness and attitude was all I got.",,,,,
"Basically I can confirm the other reviewers of this inept airline management. We were scheduled to fly on a Friday morning in June 2010 and were called by Air Tahiti Nui the night before saying there was a strike in Paris and to check the web site for updates on the flight. So we did the strike was a Civil strike in French Polynesia not Paris. Anyway we checked all night with no updates so travelled on the shuttle bus to the airport as scheduled. We stood in line for an hour to checkin before they opened the desks. Queued for another 30 mins to get to the front of the line at which point we were told to go and speak to ""that guy over there"". He told us the Paris flight was cancelled shrugging his shoulders and casting his eyes anywhere but us. He gave us a piece of paper and said to call the number. He was very dismissive and unhelpful. We did and were told initially they would book us on another airline. 10 minutes later they said they were no longer booking anyone on another airline. At which point they said we can either get a refund and get our own flights at another airline ticket desk (at now exorbitant rates) or we could wait and see if a Tahiti Nui flight would leave the next day. Maybe. They claimed all Air France flights were full. There were no offers of help. They refused to put us up in a hotel because we were ""local"" (we live 60 miles from LAX). We basically had to take the refund and get our own flights. We did get a direct flight with Air France at 9pm. It was a 777 and was basically empty. So now we have to fight our travel insurance company to get the difference in costs back. Might advice is don't travel on Air Tahiti Nui.",,,,,
"On the way to the airport in Tahiti (flight to LA) we were told the flight was cancelled becasue the pilots just went on strike no one seemed to know anything. My mother who is 89 was ill and needed to get back to the US so I called Air Tahiti and they said they could get us on Air France the next morning and to be at the airport at 4:30 am which we did. We did not have seats on Air France as promised and we were told to wait for the Air Tahiti rep who did not show up until 6:30 am. I told her that Air Tahiti had promised us seats on air france due to a medical emergency and she said ""I didn't work yesterday and I cannot help you"" and slammed the door in my face. I knocked on the door and she came out and I got exactly the same response. She was so incredibly rude considering we had been sitting on the ground in the airport for 2 hrs. Luckily we got on stand by to LA which was not our final destination. We lost all of our connecting flights. which delayed medical treatment. I would not recommend them to anyone.",,,,,
Once on the plane it was great but ground team was horrible and inept. We boarded at LAX for CDG and were amazed at the lack of urgency or customer concern. As the plane sat empty and the gate agent sat talking on her cell phone we all looked on amazed. 45 minutes after we were scheduled to board she announced we would be boarding 15 minutes late due to the plane arriving late - although it had been parked at the gate for hours as we waited. Clearly she had not looked at a clock. This caused us to depart over an hour late. Unfortunately we were on this trip during the Iceland Volcano Eruption. Air Tahiti once again proved how little they cared. I called the airlines 3 times about a flight only to be hung up on by the attendent. Once we had a flight we were told to be at the Airport 4 hours ahead of time due to the challenge from the Volcano. We arrived 4 hours early but the agents did not. We all (350 of us) waited in line. When they did show up it took them 45 minutes to get ready have coffee chat laugh joke and enjoy themselves all in front of us without any communication with us. Zero urgency or concern for all of us who had been waiting days to get on a plane. Once ticketed we went to the gate plane was there flight crew was there but not gate agents for hours we waited until they showed up and even longer while they organized themselves. It was like a circus show watching them. The whole ordeal was so ridiculous and unnecessary. The ground team has no care or concern or urgency for the passenger. I will never fly this airline again. They didn't earn any stars with us.,,,,,
PPT-AKL. Crew gracious and friendly. Huge evidence of cost cutting in food but wine and drinks selection still good. They need new seats - if person in front reclines fully there is no chance of any movement. Crew attention to safety is impressive.,,,,,
LAX-CDG First Class Seat 1D. A340. Small private cabin with only 6 seats. The crew professional and courteous. Food and wine decent. Lie flat seat very dated and more comparable to Business Class. Poor selection of movies most at least 10 years old.,,,,,
 2 times delayed then cancelled. Offer for last flight of the day. Thanks we taking different airline because next day we have to go to Europe. We had also no good feelings if it was save to use this airline. No good western standards. We advise - don't use it.,,,,,
  I seldom take the time to write a review but I feel for the well-being of other travelers I should warn everyone off these amateurs. The filght first leg of the flight was cancelled and rebooked by them except it had the second leg leaving before the first leg arrived. There was terrible communication from the airline. This seemed to be a well known problem by the airport ticket staff who booked me on a direct flight - 6 hours later which brought me to my destination after mid-night. My hosts almost fell asleep during the 90 minute drive to our accomodation. There has been zero response from Air Tanzania for compensation for the delay. Fly Airlink or anyone else in the region. Avoid Air Tanzania at all costs.,,,,,
" This is the worst airline I've ever flown with. And I've been to 50 different countries. I've never experienced anything like this from underground service.  Hours late and not a single piece of information about it. At no time was there any explanation or information as to whether there was a delay, how to proceed or when. But on the contrary. When you asked, you were ignored! Absolutely inexcusable treatment of paying customers. A brazen impertinence! ",,,,,
"  Absolutely the worst travel experience I ever had. I had to change airports and wait for 10 hours. They canceled 2 planes in the same day. No communication, no warnings, no nothing.",,,,,
"  Air Tanzania is absolutely unreliable. Our flight was delayed by 6 hours and no one can tell us when we are getting in a new flight or even what is going on. The staff is also very useless and when asked about something they just walk away saying ""just wait"". The airline is useless and so is the staff. I will not recommend Tanzania air to anyone ever and I will definitely not be using them for my next flight.",,,,,
  Already late we were sitting in the plane and I saw that our luggage was taken out of the plane. I asked for explanation from the crew and they told us that they will put them in a front cargo room due to weight issues. They didn‘t! They lied to us all! And now the luggage is in Arusha! What is this company doing! We customer have paid that we get our luggage transported and now we have to buy stuff because they on purpose they left it behind! This is unbelievable!,,,,,
 Air Tanzania delayed the flight from Mtwara to Dar last Friday by 4 hours. I missed my connecting flight to Doha. On coming Wednesday you are delaying the flight again by 4 hours. Again I miss my rescheduled flight. Rescheduling costs us >USD $400. This is not acceptable. I will never again buy an Air Tanzania ticket. I will also warn my fellow travellers not to use Air Tanzania because Air Tanzania is not a reliable airline. You can not just fly when you feel like it and take money from trusting clients for such poor service. Never again!,,,,,
"  Sorry - Air TZ email and ticketing info is the worst, and staff tries to blame it on you. If I could give negative 10 stars for the stress caused by this trip, I would. Sorry, another story about bad customer service and Air TZ. My friend and I both booked tickets and came to the terminal in the Jomo Kenyatta Airport (Nairobi) marked for Air TZ departures. However, after getting through security, we were told it was the wrong terminal. By the time we got to the correct one, the checkin gate was closed. And although there was time, we were told the flight was ready to go. They left 20 minutes early with 4 missing passengers. Wondering how we could have not gotten the right terminal, we looked over all communication we had gotten from Air TZ. There was no terminal, gate, or seat information, and only boarding time was listed. Also, when we tried to checkin online the night before and that morning, the website was full of processing errors and we each only had the tickets for the second leg of our two leg journey issued. On going to the local Nairobi office to rebook, they insisted we would have to pay a change fee. One of us had booked through a third party, and they blamed the poor email communication on that, even though all ticketing information we received from Air TZ directly looked the same for both of us. The worst thing is that local staff lied and said no other passengers had missed the flight and refused to call the airport to see if the signage was actually mismarked for the terminal! They said it was our responsibility to call customer service if we couldn't find terminal and gate information on our tickets. I pointed out that it was impossible they expect every passenger to do so. They also said it was standard to arrive 3 hours early for international flights, and if we had done so, we would have not missed it. Really? 3 hours early for a 2 hour flight? Having taken a 13 hour flight a few weeks prior, that airline only required us to show up 90 minutes early. So they want us to show up 3 hours ahead because of their poor communication and they are allowed to leave 20 minutes early? Lastly, when we were issued tickets for the rebooked departure - which we had to pay for, in addition to forfeiting our vacation hotel booking that night - all the information that was missing before was also missing on these tickets. Never again will I take Air Tanzania.",,,,,
"  Flight departed and arrived on time, was smooth, and gate staff and onboard staff were professional and helpful. Baggage pick-up was smooth and quick in Arusha.",,,,,
"  Had a safe, professional, and relatively timely experience flying Air Tanzania. My flight was about 45 minutes delayed--perfectly inexcessive as far as delays go, and still landing me at the destination airport in a timely manner to make a connecting international flight. Baggage collection was smooth. Overall review: a conventional flying experience, on par with other reputable carriers.",,,,,
"  Air Tanzania are the most incompetent and unprofessional airline I have ever used. I used them from Lusaka to Nairobi via Daresalaam on 4th September Flight 212 from Lusaka to Dar was delayed by 2 hrs ostensibly due to technical challenges which necessitated a plane change, then flight 202 from Dar to Nbi was also held up for 2 more hours while they sorted out scheduling conflicts arising from the delays, with some passengers waiting on the plane, others in the airport waiting area and yet others in the airport bus. At one point they also ran out of stationery to print boarding passes. No cogent apologies or explanations were given by the ground staff, though the Captain at some point apologized but tried to put the blame on distant Kenyan authorities. Finally arrived in Nbi at 12 midnight only to find our bags had been eft behind i Dar or Lusaka!! I finally got home at 2 am, minu my bags Needless to say, that is the first and last time I use Air Tanzania.",,,,,
  We had to emergency land due to a fuel leak on the right wing. This was detected before the flight and “fixed” and made us fly the same aircraft. After 15 mins we had to emergency land. ,,,,,
"  Worst Flight Company Ever. One day in advance we are informed on a flight cancellation and rebooking to a flight from Kilimanjaro airport instead of Arusha originally. This is causing already a 2 hours delay from the original plans. At the airport we are informed on 3 extra hours delay … Bye bye the nice evening in Zanzibar ! Few days before we had to suffer from 5h delays with Air Tanzania for the flight taking us to Tanzania. Which caused issues with our Safari organisation… Never give your money to them, prefer other plans",,,,,
"  I regret for having used this airline to Zambia on 29th June 2022 and back to Kenya on 5th July 2022, where I lost my suitcase on 29th June 2022. I have not received any information about the whereabouts of my suitcase. I went to Zambia for a wedding function and arrived there minus the clothes for the function. My stay in Zambia was very cumbersome and costly. I have tried all the avenues to follow my luggage but all is in vain. It is now 3 weeks since I lost my Luggage.",,,,,
"  I traveled last evening 1st Nov from Dar to Mumbai. It was a tight schedule since I came from Arusha and had to take this 1 hr later connecting flight at 19.50 to Mumbai TC 2400 . Within an hour, I had to get my bags from the domestic terminal to the international and do the rest of the process to be on my flight back home. When I came to the counter, I was asked for my Air Suvidha Form. Unfortunately I wasn't aware and the man behind said I could not check-in without it. At this time I had all my documents ready - both Vaccines done in India, a local covid test done at Arusha a few hrs before the flight. I showed the man behind the counter and he refused to move forward, saying I could not leave without the Air Suvidha form duly filled online (I don't know how important this form was since no one from here on asked me for the form - neither in the airport at Dar nor in Mumbai). He promptly directed me to 2 Tanzanian Airline employees and they in a very rude tone told me they could do it but it was not for free. They demanded 50,000 Tanzanian to fill the form for me and I reluctantly paid . Meanwhile I called me agent who booked the ticket for me and she too got on to the job of filling this online form. The counter was kept open since this process was on and the ladies signaled to the counter guy, probably indicating that the deal is done and they are on the job. I'm not too sure if the counter staff is a part of this racket, but I'm convinced that he is aware. If I had chosen to do this with my agent, they would have closed the counter on me, I say this cause they already told me the counter is closed and my time was up and I had to miss my flight when I first came to check in - the deal with the Tanzanian lady staff kept the counter open for me. Finally my agent filled the form and sent me the completed form before these ladies could do it. I showed it to them and they confirmed it was ok and asked me to go to the counter. The rest is standard process. No one asked me for the form. I got into the flight which was delayed for more than ½hr. The ladies didn't return my money even though they didn't do the job (that was expected considering the greed and the language they used in my brief conversation with them ). I have great respect for the people of Tanzania and admire the courtesy, care and hospitality they exhibit, but these minor isseues need to be fixed immediately to avoid damage.",,,,,
"  I have booked the flight for my clients From Arusha to Zanzibar and they make my clients delay while waiting for the manager who did not show up, I called her myself with no help at all so I decide to buy 2 tickets for $300 from Precision Air and my clients fly 30 minutes later. This is the Third time as the first time was 2 hours delay without notice and the second time was bad service onboard.",,,,,
"  The worst airline I have ever encountered. We arrived to the airport and they tell us our flight boarding has closed and the manager is coming to talk to us. The manager never came, we had to make a big fuss in the airport and we finally had to lose 3 hours of our time although we were flying back home that night. They made us book another ticket for 300$ after which they ask for cash because even the airport workers put money in their pockets which is fully disgusting to even think of. Again, we never saw the manager who made us wait 30 mins for nothing. Such an awful airplane and airport all in all in Arusha.",,,,,
" This company must be one of the worst. They cancelled my flight without any notice and it has been 3 weeks, I have tried to contact them through every channel I can (email, phone, messenger) however, they don't answer! No customer service at all. ",,,,,
"  On August 10, 2020 we were scheduled to take flight TC 105 from JRO to ZNZ, this was a confirmed flight. We were planning to start our vacation stay on Zanzibar on August 10, 2020. Since our original flight has been cancelled (or changed, or had been wrongly advertised from the beginning) we had to postpone resp. had to shorten our stay for one full day (we took flight TC 137 on August 11, 2020, instead). This incurred costs on Zanzibar for at least our hotel (126 US dollars). I wrote to and received some initial response from your incidence handling team. But in the end there was no answer of any substance at all. There was some redundant email correspondence where one person from Air Tanzania haphazardly tried to make another person take some action (which action remained unclear). What I wanted was an explanation, an apology (for ruining one day of our holidays that we spent in lovely Tanzania in spite of the troubles we went to be able to travel abroad at all at these difficult times), and US$126 for the day we could not spend at Zanzibar (but had to pay for anyway) but instead at the miserable hotel near the airport.  It only remains to express my severe regret to have travelled with Air Tanzania. I also think of their customer complaint handling as being quite unprofessional. When I tried to use the contact form on the Air Tanzania website it turned out to be unusable because it would not send my text. Then I tried to contact [email protected] with the same text. The mail bounced immediately because, as it turns out, Air Tanzania blacklisted my email address! That's quite a impertinent way to deal with your customers.",,,,,
"  Mumbai to Zanizibar via Dar Es Salaam. As I have not been able to take this flight, my review covers customer service and booking issues with Air Tanzania. In November 2019 I booked two return flights with Air Tanzania. On receiving the e tickets, I noticed that my surname had been duplicated, thus rendering the ticket invalid. I immediately contacted the airline, via their on line contact page and a further email as back up. To date, I have received no response from the airline. I know that my emails have been received because the Air Tanzania sales office in Mumbai were copied in and have acknowledged receipt. I have made an official complaint, even copying in the Tanzanian Ministry of Transport who have overall responsibility for the airline. Once again, no response. I have thus been forced to cancel the tickets, which apparently are not refundable. I would urge potential travellers not to use Air Tanzania.Their indifference to customer service is well documented. I just hadn't realised how bad things are",,,,,
"  I flew home from Rome to Toronto an almost 10hr flight. First we were given separated seats (traveling as a couple) the check in attendant was rude and kept us waiting for 20 minutes didn't even mention that the seats weren't together. The flight was delayed for 18 minutes, no communication. The worst part was the food, it looked like left over boiled chicken with some nasty sauce and soggy tasteless veggies. Best part was the friendly air hostess and the smoothest landing.",,,,,
"  Abysmal customer service! While the flight and onboard service were fine, the customer service is shambolic. During transit, they lost my backpack. There was no one at the counter to speak to, so you had to call their emergency line (together with a dozen other passengers). During the call they verified my details, where they made a typo which resulted in me missing their emails regarding my bag. They only found out once I contacted them about whether they had found my bag. They said they were not able to reach me, even after confirming my details 3 times. Then they said it would be at the Montreal airport and they would contact me to send it to Ottawa (I was travelling across the country). By the time I had left Ottawa in contacted them again regarding the status of this case. They said they sent it to Toronto. That was my next destination, so I asked if they could leave it there so I can pick it up. I went to Toronto airport and the bag was nowhere to be found. Contacted them again and they said it was in Montreal. None of the customer service agents was able to answer my question and I kept having to repeat the case to every single on of them. They told me to contact the lost baggage department (only via email), but they did not respond. After two weeks of persistent calling, I received my luggage. In the meantime I had to buy a new bag and clothes etc to be able to travel. According to the lady on the phone, I could just file a complaint and attach the receipts so I would get compensation for the incurred costs. So I did. Never heard anything back from them. I made the request 3 times, because there may have gone something wrong. Until today, I haven’t heard anything from Air Transat! This has cost me an extra few hundred dollars, which they said they would repay me. All in all the customer service was completely incapable (except for the man (I believe his name was Mike)) who was able to deliver my luggage. Very hard to reach them in the first place and especially once you’re back home. Don’t keep their promises and simply lied about repaying the damages.  Worst experience I’ve ever had.",,,,,
" It was a pleasant flight going to and coming back from London. I recently flew on Air Transat for an international flight to London and they partnered with Porter Airlines for the domestic route within Canada. Unable to manage booking online because of share code; Not clear about luggage allowance; hence, I learned that my booking did not include any checked-in luggage and had to pay at the airport going to and returning from London; Blankets are for sale if you need one; Food and beverages are complementary but are just okay; bland – no pepper or salt; Cellphone charger are found beneath the seats and will need an adapter (no direct USB port); The ground service in London is much friendlier than in Canada. Never again!",,,,,
"  Absolutely the worst airline I’ve flown. They will delay you, give you one meal for an 8+ hour flight, incredibly uncomfortable seats and charge $11 for a blanket. We were given dinner and our breakfast was a slice of banana bread. On the flight back home we were also in the worst terminal at Paris CDG. The price of this flight was not even remotely affordable. ",,,,,
"  We paid for eco plus despite having the basic economy tickets and then booked my elderly grandmother separately on the expensive exit row seats to ensure she had enough room to manoeuvre. Upon boarding the plane I realise they have changed our selected seats which we paid for without telling me and so then have to speak to the stewardess about asking other people to move, they also switched my aisle seat for a middle seat which I find ridiculous. On top of that these seats we had paid a lot of extra money for were the most uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in. They are designed with a immoveable armrest that is tiny we all came off the plane with bruises on our thighs because of the tightness of the seat, the flight was genuinely painful and none of us are extremely big people so I can only imagine someone who is a bit bigger would genuinely be unable to sit in that seat for the flights duration. ",,,,,
"  I was disappointed with the service and seating on my recent flight. For the price paid, I expected a more comfortable experience and better customer service. I hope the airline takes this feedback into consideration for future improvements. Unless you are travelling to Europe or perhaps to an other place but truly enjoy the pain and discomfort of seats that don’t recline, do not book. P.S The staff aren't even nice.",,,,,
" Our family was very impressed with our first flight with Air Transat. The Check-in and boarding process was smooth and efficient. Staff were friendly and very competent. The onboard experience was pleasant even though an older aircraft was utilized. We were pleased to have good legroom in economy seats for the nine hour flight. Flight attendants very friendly, efficient and attentive. The flight was delayed, but only about 15 minutes late arriving in Toronto. We most certainly will fly Air Transat again.",,,,,
"  Worst flight experience of my whole life by a huge gap. The 4 hour flight took almost 10 hours and waited more than an hour inside the plane in the airport to be assigned to a gate. I nearly lost my next flight which was supposed to have 5 hours connection time. They used buses to transfer passengers to the plane. We waited standing inside a still bus parked in front of the plane for 20 minutes and transferred back to the airplane:)) but since couldn’t go back inside the airport, they asked us to sit down on the floor. The staff didn’t bother to speak english to the passengers of an international flight to Amsterdam.",,,,,
" My initial experience with Air Transat was positive, but upon arriving in Montreal, I had to walk several miles to catch my connecting flight and stand in long lines. Because I have a learning disability and anxiety (and Air Transat does not offer assistance), I had to rely on asking Air Transat agents at the terminal for help. I eventually sat where I was advised to sit, which was to the left of the gate, where I could not hear announcements and missed my window to board. While the agents on site were very understanding, the Air Transat hotline that I was told to call offered no assistance. I was not given the option to rebook the flight. Instead, I found myself stranded at the airport for 48 hours (!) and had to pay for a brand-new ticket. I repeatedly called the customer service hotline, but agents there were very rude and offered no assistance. After 200+ flights, this is the first really bad experience I've had.",,,,,
"  I want to write a review about the agent David Ngoie from AIr Transat he helped me a lot since I had to change the name on the flight i booked to match my daughter's passport, I tried with the third party I booked with Flight Hub and they wanted to charge me a big amount to do that even though this was only the next day to my booking, I called Air transat and the first agent i spoke with didn't even want to check and told me flight hub has to do it. I called again and David answered and took the time to review my reservation and was able to do the change and sent me confirmation with no fee or any complications. Thank you so much David",,,,,
"  This is a review for the customer service. I booked the most bargain bucket eco-budget ticket and then realised I made a mistake on my booking - worth over 1000 USD. Even though they had no obligation to refund me, they did - every penny. Took some time because they had to get approval from the accounts side, etc, but just showed how much they go above and beyond. Air Transat - thank you!",,,,,
"  If you have a other option take it. Flight was delayed 3 times before they told us it was cancelled and rescheduled for the following day due to weather  it was sunny when they cancelled our flight) then the flight that was scheduled after ours went out. There was no compensation given, so no hotel room no food vouchers and no compensation for a lost night at the resort. We paid for seat selection and weren’t seated where we paid for and just told to call our travel agents. I will never fly with Transat again. They completely ruined our trip. On our flight home they didn’t restock the plane so we were left with whatever food was leftover from the flight before ours so we got old stale pizza.",,,,,
"  The airline and onboard service was perfect. My issue is with the resort commute service only: I was left in resort with my partner just because of having 3 minutes delay in coming to lobby! Not even 5 min they wait, and I had to pay $60 to taxi to airport in Porto Plata. I complained about it and person in charge, provided some nonsense instead of giving a convincing response. Not happy with the service there.",,,,,
  Suzanne and her associates were awesome in service. There was a unruly and abusive traveller sitting near me and they made sure he didn't hurt anyone and tried their best to ensure he was amicable as possible. The traveller should not have been travelling alone. Suzanne continually ensured I was ok and appreciated that I had to deal with this person for a long flight.,,,,,
  Our flights with Air Transat are seamless and pleasant. We traveled to Cuba this year after 3 years of Covid. The staff were so helpful and accommodating. We came home on Valentine's Day and our grandson gave Valentine's cards to the flight attendants and was allowed to give the Captain the same once the plane arrived in Toronto. Our luggage arrived in Cuba without issue and also back home to Toronto. I can't even express enough what a pleasant experience we had. Air Transat will be our go to airline when traveling.,,,,,
"  At a time when airlines are getting lots of bad press, what a nice surprise it was flying with Air Transat. Both our flights to Punta Cana and home were flawless. We will definitely use Transat again.",,,,,
 We flew with Air Transat on January 1 2023 from Toronto to Puerto Plata on TS 844 and returned on January 8 2023 on flight TS 845. A most enjoyable flight and excellent flight crew in both directions. They made our air travel very comfortable and relaxing. We would recommend Air Transat to anyone flying to use .,,,,,
  The Air Transat staff in Toronto was absolutely tremendous helping with a mix-up of golf bags upon our return from Punta Cana. I mistakenly took the wrong bag and the Staff did everything possible to ensure the bag i had taken got returned to it's rightful owner and that I received my bag promptly and with the utmost care. Thank you to the Air Transat Toronto Staff. You are terrific.,,,,,
"  Another great flight with Air Transat! I prefer this airline than any of the other charter airlines out of Toronto Pearson. Flew club class. Service excellent start to finish, friendly staff. Nice meal and snacks. Amenity kits, comfortable big seats, big screens. Content is a bit dated but something to entertain. Flight left on time, arrived early. Onboarding quick. Exiting the plane was quick and efficient. Bags arrived and were off the plane fast. Air Transat has never let me down. ",,,,,
"  What Air Transat did to me, I wouldn’t even wish that on my enemies. I was supposed to fly to Manchester on December 24 2022 for departure at 9 50 pm but my issues started with them at 5 50 pm. When they were checking me in, the whole process was sketchy where they were piling suit cases for all destinations in one area. I said how will you even find the correct luggage. Was told sir do not worry about it. Moving on, checked in all was fine when at 9 50 pm passengers were told the incoming flight from Montreal is delayed and we’ll take off at 11 30. Post midnight we finally boarded and now announcements started one after the other by the captain that were still waiting for luggage to arrive. Long story short 3 hours later , luggage still didn’t arrive and the crews time had expired, and now they couldn’t fly anymore. At 3 30 am, we were told to disembark with a departure time of 8 20 am provided. I decided to wait and at 815 am, we were told that the crew has not arrived yet and we will be taking off at 10 am. Now, We were told that the crew is on its way but somehow in the middle, the crew got lost and the pilot never showed up for the time specified. Maybe between the time he left his house to the airport, he called in sick. So what now ? Departure is at 9 50 pm at night of the following day. At this point I said give me back my luggage and I’m happy to leave. They’re like we need time locating it and the staff escorted me out to a domestic arrival area where easily 1000 bags were piled and I was now on my own to look for it. 2 hours of searching I somehow located my bag and called it a day on the worst Christmas ever! (It took me 18 hours to get out of there) I hope I can call tomorrow and get a refund! I’m sure that is going be another nightmare. This Is a combination of poor airline decisions combined with the worst airport crew in the history of North America.  On top of it all, they gave out $15 meal vouchers when everything at Pearson is 20 dollars and up.",,,,,
"  I’ve traveled with this airline on a roundtrip from Madrid to Montreal and all I can say is I will never fly with them again. They lost my luggage on a direct flight! They advised me to check my handbag at the check in point saying that the airplane was full and that I may have to check it in anyway at the boarding gate. So I followed their advice and I arrived to Montreal and they had lost my luggage. My bag arrived to Madrid 9 days later, and it hand a grip broken and my toiletries bag had been stolen. What’s even worse, the airline is bound to reimburse you for the expenses you incur while you are without luggage. Their policy states they will reimburse you up to 50 CAD/day for each day you don’t have your luggage with you. Well guess what after more than 2 months of claiming less than 300 CAD for the expenses I had during my trip without my personal belonging, I haven’t heard a word back from them. I’ve reached out to them like 5 times in the past 2 months and they are simply ignoring me. So at this point I assume they will simply not reimburse me any of the expenses. If you fly with this airline, expect your luggage to be lost, even on direct flights, and don’t expect any compensation for the trouble they caused you. Never again!",,,,,
" Customer service is a joke with these guys. Only two ways you can contact by phone and by Facebook chat and none of them working properly. I was on phone with automated service and music on hold for more than 2 hours. On chat more than 2 hours and none of the agent shows up. So, their false information about availability 24/7 is a just joke.",,,,,
"  I have flown with this airline several times from Canada to destinations south and in Europe. I have never had any issues flying with them. As they are often the cheaper option when it comes to travel, I can get to where I want to go with ease and know i am getting great service for the price i pay. I never had an issue with their customer service as I typically am a well-prepared traveler, and know what to expect. But when I'm in the airport the staff was helpful in using the self-luggage check-in. They were quick and helped me through the process and i was quickly through Security. Boarding is always ease, and they are there to help you find your seat quickly. While like some airlines they do not provide a blanket and pillow, i did pay for Options plus, which gave me a comfort kit. I do recommend price matching with the Options plus and eco standard as sometimes it could be cheaper. As well, I suggest bringing a blanket on board for comfort and warmth. The food is typical airplane food, nothing special about it. Overall it was a comfortable flight and quick to arrive at my destination.",,,,,
"  I rarely post reviews about anything but this one tops one of the worst experiences I’ve ever had. Within 5 minutes of boarding the flight, the passenger in front of me attempts to recline her seat so far back she bangs it against my knees. She continues doing so over and over again and of course cannot recline because my knees are in the way ( no fault of my own) She proceeds to call the stewardess and tell her that her seat isn’t reclining. The stewardess addresses me and starts explaining that it is the passengers right to recline her chair. I explain that while I understand that it is her right, I cannot do anything about my legs being there, I simply cannot move my legs!! The stewardess and the passenger both gang up on me and the stewardess continues with the same speech that the passenger has every right to recline. At this point I am frustrating and keep explain the same thing! I have no space!!! The stewardess then engages a random passenger in the same row who is completely unrelated to this situation and says “Do you not agree that it is her right to recline her seat?!?” At this point I don’t engage them anymore because I know they can simply kick me off the flight if the feel like it. The passenger then changes seats and for the remainder of the flight the stewardess does not give me and my friend any service what so ever for 6.5 hours. Barry looking at us or offering to take our trash or anything if that sort. Never again Air Transat,",,,,,
"  Worst flight experience. If this is your only option, just don’t do it. Aircraft was packed. I wasn’t allowed to keep my hand luggage with me even after explaining that I’d a short connection after. Got no attention from ground staff. All rude on their phones disregarding client’s urgencies. Missed my connection flight due to long waiting time at the belt for my checked in hand luggage. They didn’t arranged another flight nor overnight staying after spending an hour and half on the phone with customer service that sounded like was going to solve my problem but let me on hold for an hour. I do not recommend not even to my worst enemy.",,,,,
" Zero customer service; phone hold times over 2 hours, their assistance bot couldn't be any more useless, absolutely no help at any counters. Pay extra for Flex, can't even use it because there's no one to help and no one answers any phones. Employees are nice but are not empowered to really help you beyond a kind word; Honestly, the company puts them in the line of fire to distance themselves instead of doing anything solve any issues. Wish I could score them lower all around, save your money fly with someone who actually cares.",,,,,
"  I was on a 3-month trip with most of my favorite clothes. Air Transat lost my checked bag. There has been no way to reach a human; phone numbers refer to the online system. I took each step recommended online. It has been 3 months, and I have received nothing but an auto-reply to my substantial claim of loss. I highly recommend avoiding this airline at all costs.",,,,,
  Worst customer service ever. I had to cancel my flight as my father passed away suddenly. I was refunded around £500 for tickets I paid £1195 for. I eventually found an email address which is largely hidden on their websites and email confirmations to get a hold of customer services. I have tried to get in touch with customer services as I have not had a reply back over the last 2 weeks. There is zero customer service from this airline. ,,,,,
"  I just returned from Glasgow yesterday on an Air Transat plane, quite old, maybe an A330. My seat was changed three times prior to going to the airport, and as usual I paid the extra for Option Plus on both legs of the journey. This was a waste of money on the return flight. In the boarding area there was just loads of people with no organisation whatsoever I did ask one of the attendants when are they calling option plus and she informed me that it would be called after the people who required medical assistance. Once again this did not happen as they boarded the people in group one, then started to board group two .. shortly after they call all groups to board. This was bad enough but once in the air it didn’t get any better. I had to ask for a blanket as I was extremely cold, this is when I finally told him that I was option plus. He was very surprised, then went back to get me the blanket package. There was no snacks after takeoff, surprisingly. Then came the meal which was given to everyone on the plane? I always take option plus for the convenience of my flight, but never have I had to tell anyone on board that I had it. I was very disappointed by this and of my luggage was tagged as priority and yet I was the last one to leave the carousel. I feel in this case that I should be given a refund of the money I paid for Option Plus.",,,,,
"  
We never heard Club Class being called, yet heard they will be calling by groups. They called 2-5, then shortly after added 6&7. We lined up and while in line my spouse went up to the counter and inquired about Club Class, and the Attendant said “we did, you missed it”. Nothing else, so she joined me back in line. I  mentioned it to the Attendant while being greeted coming aboard and she simply, “well all those people did” (gesturing to the 8 of the 12 people seated in Club Class).  So after paying for Club Class, what was our reward - arriving at our seats to find the overhead cabins were unavailable. Understandable, as they are used for staff/plane storage. Acceptable but no alternative immediately available until the gentleman seated next to us offered us space. For the extra value spent, it was a horrible beginning to a long-awaited trip to Spain. Hoping our return trip is much better! In todays challenging environment, it seems like customer service is hit or miss. BTW - our hostess was cheerful, friendly and hospitable - something that could be beneficial to the gate counter lead and plane boarding attendant.",,,,,
"  The seats are good since I paid extra to get it. However, my meal selection was vegetarian and I was given a chicken meal. Thank God I am always cautious and these situations make me more paranoid and not trust people and services. I was given chicken pasta instead of veg pasta. I called the rep and asked if this was veg or chicken. The guy laughed and said no it's chicken, it's a mistake. I am vegetarian because I have severe allergies to meat, fish and seafood products.  He went and brought back a veg pasta and there was no apology nothing. Gave me butter but no bread but others got bread. The movies are same as other Air Transat and old ones. I paid extra to get this?",,,,,
" Montreal to Brussels. Worst flying experience so far in my life. Upgraded to economy plus, to make sure of priority luggage handling. Its been a week since I landed now and no new of my lost luggage yet, which I need to properly execute my job. No way to get proper response and help the claim of being available 24/7 is a blatant lie. Next to this in flight there was no option for my dietary restriction to which the staff promptly gave me chicken and pasta, where I just made clear I don't eat meat. Truly terrible and costing me money at this moment every day I can't do my job properly",,,,,
" Toronto to Fort Lauderdale. This is the worst customer service ever. I bought some tickets from Toronto to Fort Lauderdale for September 9, 2022. Since Immigration Canada has not sent me my new permanent residence card, I cannot travel. I have been trying to communicate with Air Transat for days and finally, after an hour and fifty minutes of waiting, they answered me in customer service. After explaining the situation to the woman who answered, she promised me that everything was resolved and that I only had to call my agent (Flighthub), and that they could give me the credit to travel on another date or when I received the new permanent resident card. So I called my agent but they checked and there was no note on the reservation. And they told me that I should call Air Transat again. I have been trying for the last two days with no success. I have called several times and after more than an hour of waiting per call, this is disconnected by Air Transat. My trip is scheduled for tomorrow morning so I will lose almost CA$1000 due to Air Transat's lousy customer service. I don't understand why the woman told me this and she didn't do anything. It's totally unfair",,,,,
"  This was my third experience with this airline this year, and will be the last. I have never departed on time and they seem to have very poor organisation. The way they treat passengers is not friendly and they are not helpful at all. Boarding chaotic and priority order not respected. On our last trip we were travelling in club class and our luggage had special tags and were supposed to be delivered first at arrival - they lost our suitcase. Their website instruct passengers to contact their agent at the airport, but there was no air Transat agent or desk at Basel airport. The airline was totally unhelpful and to date we have not heard anything from them or any other party regarding our lost luggage. No idea if our luggage was lost at Montreal airport, Basel airport or stolen. No apologies, no compensation. What is the point of paying an extra fee for a better service if there is no service in the end. ",,,,,
" My flight to Lisbon and back to Toronto was a nightmare. The plane was so old that not even a logo had, the chairs didn’t work, the arm chairs were broken, the meal - couldn’t touch a thing, it’s unbelievable how a company like Air Transat uses these kind of planes and charges the ridiculous amount of money for the tickets. I will never again buy a flight with Air Transat.",,,,,
"  I flew with Air Transat because the tickets were cheap. Now I know why. I took 3 flights with this company. Each flight was at least 30 minutes late. I had two returning flights. Because my first flight was late, I scrambled and ran to my 2nd one. No surprise, it was late. When I went to board, I was informed that AT rebooked me to a later flight due to the delay of the first flight. I requested to stay on my original flight. The attendants were unable to make this happen electronically despite (1) my seat still being available and extra seats available and (2) me actually being there and on time. I had no voice or autonomy in this change, which was unreasonable and surprising. I will never fly with Air Transat again. I will never recommend that my friends, family, or colleagues fly with Air Transat. Frustrating and disappointing experience.",,,,,
"  Air Transat provides an unbelievably poor customer experience. My flight was delayed by 3hr in Gatwick resulting a missed connection and loss of baggage. Furthermore the check in staff at Gatwick were aware I would miss my flight and were unable to rebook my itinerary. Really poor customer experience. Furthermore following the loss of my baggage the airline handed my luggage to a really poor no name courier firm at Toronto who are seemingly unable to communicate. Again any other airline would use a reputable firm such as UPS, FedEx or DHL. Finally the A321 provides a really poor experience flying transatlantic. In total you are best spending your money on a full service airline such as British Airways or Lufthansa.",,,,,
"  Would never recommend this airline. Let start off with the first flight where I purchase flight and upgrades to reserve seating and leg room. Roughly 700 additional each way plus the previous 1000 for the ticket. The day of the flight they decided to charge the plane and remove my reservation to the seats I paid for. Then placed me at the back of the plane with zero leg room. Being a 6ft tall male makes the seating they gave me quite uncomfortable. The plane was unfit to fly exhaust fumed from the engines entering th cabin, the seats falling apart and major electrical issues. Had the reading light on my flight on for 7hrs, no one could turn it off cause the button on my seat controlled the seat 5 rows ahead of mine. On top off all of this the flight team did nothing nor served drinks. Went 7hrs with out water was a joke. On the return flight same seat scenario occurred. My seats were changed even though they were pre reserved and then reconfirm after the first flight was a mess. They still managed to mess it up, along the flight the in flight manager was harrasing my parent who dont speak English, who had paid and reserved seating front row before first class (which they were trying to take). They want to give it to a young couple with a baby. So i came up from the rear of the plane to diffuse the problem and move my parents to help out the young couple out. Even though the couple was completely rude and disrespectful, we still helped out at our cost even though not only me paying 700x4 for upgrades which would of covered my parents to be moved to first class. They put them in the back of the plane and took out upgrade money. I began the claim in July and it is now 30+ days and they have yet to reach out to refund my money for the upgrades. ",,,,,
"  I booked an emergency flight to Amsterdam, but I got rejected while checking in because I don't have three doses of the covid-vaccine even though your own website and Amsterdam's government website states that you only need two to travel from Toronto to Amsterdam. I am considered fully vaccinated. You cost me not only missing the funeral, but my time, gas, tears, and money. ",,,,,
"  Toronto to Dublin. The worst airline anyone could ever think of, with ridiculous service and overworked staff. Lost baggage and nobody is even looking for it. My worst experience in air travel.",,,,,
"  Departure was on time, however as soon as everyone was seated captain announced that they have no crew to fly and will have to go to London to get replacement crew, by doing so we lost about 3 hours. New crew started complaining about shortage of cups and some other stuff.  In  the flight captain announced that toilet's on the airplane stopped working and we will have to land in Montreal in order to look at it. Waist tank was full and needed to be pumped. After pumping the tank we continue to Toronto with total of 13.5 hours (6.5 hours delay).",,,,,
"  Lisbon to Los Angeles via Montreal. As others have said, their lost luggage service is virtually non-existent. Air Transat lost a bag almost two months ago, and we still haven't gotten a reimbursement! Calling or emailing for an update is simply impossible. No one responds to email, the website is no help, and the baggage hotline just redirects to the website. I've never experienced such awful customer service in my life. It's no use buying a low-cost airfare if you're going to get screwed in the long run.",,,,,
"  The waiting time for calling them is over 4 hours easily. We have this small rescue dog, weighing about 10lbs, we would like to bring her with us to the trip. Before we purchased the ticket, we checked airline website to see the pet policy, and it was stated, that we could pay for the pets in carry on bag. So I was trying to reach the airline to pre-pay for the carry-on pet. I was on hold for over an hour and talked to a gentleman who claimed he didn't know how to do it and transferred me to another line, which I waited for more than 3 hours, so by the time, i got to talk to the lady, the time had passed 72 hours prior boarding time. and i was told i couldn't pre-pay to reserve for the carry on dog, and i need to go to the desk on the departure day, My family arrived the evening before our flight and I double checked with the desk people, and an on duty manager said it was OK, I was hoping to pay and make sure she can come on board on the next day flight. The guy said i couldn't do it until 4 hours to departure. So we got to the desk 3 hours before departure, the line person, the desk person all let us pass and put a sticker on our dog's bag. We boarded the airplane. For this flight, I paid extra 175 for reserving some seats for my whole family. The flight attendant found our dog bag was in front of my husband's seat, which is a special seat, no other seat in front of him, complained the bag needs to be underneath the front seat, how we could get this seat first place with a dog carry on. They got a gate person up to complain, and the gated person wanted me to show the receipt we paid for the dog, i told her what happened, and i didn't get a chance to pay for her on the phone or through the check in desk. So she started accusing us smuggling in the dog, as if we were criminal, even we showed her the canal sticker on the bag, and told her we got checked in by their airline desk. She insisted throwing us off the airplane and was very rude. I begged for paying at the spot, she said there is no way for her to take the money. Finally i moved the dog bag to be in front of my seat, behind another seat, the plane attendants were OK with it, she still insisted in throwing us out, other passengers were trying to speak for us. Finally the pilot said it is OK to let us fly. The entire episode lasted over an hour. my family and I were totally stressed. We finally made it. I will never fly with them again.",,,,,
"  A dysfunctional website and app that doesn't allow ticket change or booking a special meal. It leads to errors all the time. No technical support. No one answering the phone after hours of waiting and dozens of attempts. Therefore no possibilities to change my ticket or do with an agent what I can't do online. No warnings about anything, no one telling you anything. The worst airline I ever flew with.",,,,,
"  We were returning from our trip to Western Canada via Calgary Airport on July 29, 2022. Out of approximately 200 people flying, the agent at the Boarding kiosk, we lined for my husband and me sitting and waiting for boarding call. Prior to that they kept announcing that the flight was full and there was no room for carry on luggage. Not too many people got up to give up their carry on because of what has been happening at the airports with lost luggage and chaos. Having flown to Europe with Air Transat June 23-July 6, 2022 for a Mediterranean cruise, they lost my husband’s luggage and we never got it back while in Europe. So when the agent came and asked us to give up our carry on, which they allow to have, I spoke up loud and clear that “sorry Madam but I’m not going to do that because your airline lost my luggage on June 23 and have not found it plus I have my meds in and what am I to do if I don’t get this luggage in Toronto” My husband tried to explain as well, but she walked away. Shortly after this she brought her boss to us who without listening to my story, told me to “shut up” and asked my husband for our Boarding Passes. He confiscated them and told us that where we would be sitting Row 16 there was no room for any carry on luggage, period. He also told us that I was confrontational and aggressive towards the agent and it will not be tolerated.  My husband decided to check our only 1 carry on. When he approached the kiosk, a new agent who was told to keep our Boarding Passes, started on my husband. Asked where I was to get me now. I approached with my small backpack and my husband had a backpack as well as personal items. The agent threatened that if I speak, because I asked if I could tell him my story, he will call security and remove us from our flight. He also demanded for us to check our personal items, that is our backpacks, no ifs or buts. We had no choice but to give up our personal items. I flew and was cold through my 3hrs 50 mins flight. We were shocked and so stressed. Never had I been treated like this in all the time I have been flying. Other people had duffle bags, that barely fitted under the seat, lots of room overhead because we saw when people were removing their belongings. We just prayed we would receive our bags, and yes we did. We also stayed and tried searching for our luggage from previous trip to no avail. Finally on Aug 3, 2022 we got our luggage delivered to our home after non-stop calls to Air Transat, we had the luggage dept on speed dial and once a week we could actually speak to an agent. Finally after 6 weeks we got our luggage from our first trip with Air Transat.",,,,,
"  My flight was from Toronto to Calgary. The airline misplaced my baggage, it's been more than 24hrs now. Came back to the airport with an uber necause they never gave me any tracking number on the yellow slip, called more than 50 times. Zero help. A very terrible and bad experience for my first flight with this Airline and it will be the last time.",,,,,
" We flew from Calgary-Montreal-Paris. Paid almost $350 for the 3 checked bags. Our bags never arrived in Paris. We filed a ""missing bags"" complaint after arrival with a great difficulty as English is not their forte. The flight was delayed just over 2 hours to Paris. Till the day we were in Paris, our luggage was never delivered, there was no communication from Air Transat to us about the luggage. In Paris, they did not even know where our luggage was! We followed up everyday (actually my nephew would call as he is fluent in French) lucky us as we had him, I can only imagine what other customers would be going through who cannot speak French as to if they would even get a response. We got a call from some driver who was to deliver our luggage 2 days after we arrived and said to us that ""we have your bags and we will deliver at 7 pm"" we did not know that they only had one bag. We cancelled our sightseeing plans and rushed home to find out with dismay that no bags were delivered and no call was made to inform us why. After this date, everyday we would follow up and got told that our bags would be delivered at 7 pm but never followed through. Finally the day before we were leaving Paris to Delhi via a different airline (22nd morning) we drove to airport to get our luggage. We thought we were to go to the terminal and talk to someone at Air Transat. To our surprise, we got a call from SOS Baggage and were told all our bags, not just one or two, are with them. Air Transat apparently hands over customers luggage's to some ""baggage delivery service"" which in turn hands it over to this SOS Baggage company that actually is a store which sells travel bags and accessories. The customer service at this place was pathetic - no apologies, no explanation as to why the delay, why these were not delivered for these many days nothing! On my insistence and a bit of raising the voice, I was finally given emails about paper trail and to my utter dismay they had the bags since 18th June, the very next day we arrived in Paris. It is pathetic that Air Transat deals with such a company that charges them for bags delivery but never does, is unprofessional, provides lousy customer service and does not give a rats ass for customer or their vacation plans going haywire. Nobody till date has even contacted us with an apology, compensation nothing. Worst customer service. Isn't there an EU rule that if your flight is delayed by 2 hours you get 50% compensation?",,,,,
"  Toronto to Zagreb, I wish we had one good thing to say except one friendly flight attendant that made small chat. The rest of the staff seemed out on a mission to make passengers suffer. I was woken up from sleep bc the mask slid off my nose. To make it more interesting, while having the meal, the flight attendant reminded me to have a mask on. At the end of the flight an attendant reminded me to have the seat up. I showed her by pressing the button that the seat is broken, it doesn’t go up. She pushes on it and again it doesn’t move. She gets angry and argues that she is doing her job. She brings another attendant who says that the attendant is doing her job. I repeat, the seat is broken. She pushes the button. The seat doesn’t move. At That point she is shaking the seat with full force and two hands manages to move it up.  And to end the trip one of our luggage never came. It’s been 4 days now and there has been no communication form air transat on the status of our lost property.",,,,,
"  I would like to thank Twyla Tracey, who was a great help to me on two occasions. She was very understanding, very polite and very helpful. This was the first time booking online and I ran into problems, and she was able to help me sort everything out. This is a big thank you to Twyla.",,,,,
" While the staff on this flight were fine, the aircraft and overall Air Transat experience were pretty lacklustre. The plane felt extremely tired and dated - no screens, the USB outlets didn’t work (apparently this was the case for the whole flight), the beverage options were tiny and the inflight entertainment system worked for all of 5 minutes, and then stopped. They charged $11 for headphones, which people were unable to use due to there being no TVs, etc. This was a completely different experience from our other flight with Air Canada, who had USB A and USB C outlets, as well as standard AC outlets, had the screens with a bunch of entertainment options (movies, shows, maps), the drinks were standard size drinks (ie, a full soda can) We’ll definitely avoid flying Air Transat again, as it appears they cut costs in comfort.",,,,,
"  Terrible customer service! Airline lost ours and about 10 people's bags on the flight to Calgary. Upon landing, there were no Air Transat employees at the Calgary Airport to help. An airport employee helped everyone file a report and we were told that we would be called the following day. 5 days later and still no call. We have tried emailing and calling multiple times. No answer when calling, no call back after leaving multiple messages. We received an email back and were told that they can't access our file until 7 days after the flight. We even went back to the airport to try and talk to someone in person - also no help. An Air Canada employee was actually much more helpful than anyone from Air Transat. No effort is being made to locate our baggage in a timely manner. We were planning on camping in Banff on this trip, however, all of our camping gear is in the lost baggage. We are now forced to go buy new gear (tent, sleeping pads, etc.) or pay $300 a night for a hotel in Banff. Baggage gets lost, it happens. However, this customer service is atrocious. Never recommend flying Air Transat!",,,,,
"  3 hours delay with absolutely no explanation why the flight keeps being postponed every 45 minutes. This is not an airline, it is horrible service.",,,,,
"  Paying for Options Plus is a scam. You supposedly changed the rules of what you receive as a Plus. In Toronto I was registering in Economy and not Options Plus (as no one was there) for a flight that was leaving for 9am. I was told to go to gate C2 for boarding. My partner and I sat there for 2 hours and no one said that the gate was changed. Luckily we started to notice no one at our gate and checked the screen. Oh yes, Gate got changed. There was no announcement. What I am most shocked about is that on top of the fee that I was charged Options Plus I still had to pay another fee for seat selection. In the past, everything was included under Options Plus. So I'm in the plane now and then find out that you don't get a meal with Options Plus or any of the other amenities any longer. Well let me tell you for the fee that you charged me for Options Plus is not not worth one dime. Now I'm in Punta Cana coming home and again it didn't matter if I was under Options Plus - I could have been in the line-up for Economy. So the only benefit I found when you pay for Options Plus is that you get your baggage first - that's it. In total for 2 ppl, $316.00 was charged. I have been flying with Air Transat since about 2008/2009, and this is now the last time. In addition, while staying at the Bahia Principe in Punta Cana and 3 days before we were returning to Canada, we could not locate the Air Transat rep to find out when the bus was picking us up for the airport. All the other airline reps were there everyday, except her representing Air Transat. When she did finally show up, she was rude that we were making her accountable for not being around. Then in speaking with the other ppl taking the same flight as us, they had made comments that they couldn't find Air Transat rep at the same resort we were at. Anyway it is my fault for not checking that the amenities that were included under Options Plus, no longer exists and I feel that I got so ripped off.",,,,,
  I’m having this flight for the second time and it was late both of the times. This time we had to wait for 5 hour and we  were not even informed earlier. We got to know about the delay when we checked in. I won’t travel with this airline again.,,,,,
"  Voicing what other reviewers have said, Air Transat call centre/customer service is non existent. After waiting for hours, you still don't get a chance to talk to anyone. The option to add a suitcase before 24 hours so you can pay a little less was impossible to achieve on their website or app. I have been on the phone with them for 1h30+ and did not manage to speak with anyone. On my flight to Toronto from London, the cabin crew pointed out I could speak with the Air Transat people who would be waiting at the gate. I explained my issue about adding my suitcase for my return, and their answer was still you need to call this number, and they would pick up this Canadian number in 15 minutes. I said I couldn't call from Canada because I don't have a Canadian phone, and asked to call from theirs - of course the lady looked at her colleague nervously smiling and told me she wasn't allowed to do so. When speaking to people in the check-in area, they explained in most areas they are sub-contracted employees from Air Transat and they cannot help with anything else than paying for your luggage when you get to the airport 2h before your flight. It is impossible to speak to anyone to sort out your problems - avoid at all costs! Additionally, how ridiculous is it to charge extra for luggage on a Trans-Atlantic flight? Furthermore, food in the plane is stingy and borderline inedible. Kudos to the cabin crew though, working in that environment I am sure they put up with every day, they were quite lovely.",,,,,
"  Writing this on Sunday night, we flew Wednesday. Luggage is sitting in Montreal, Transat knows where it is and still won't send it. It's starting to feel personal at this point. I would try Air Canada, West jet or a Euro company before Transat as they really don't seem too concerned about our family's trip at all.",,,,,
"  I had a very hard time getting in touch with customer service, over an hour wait. I originally spoke with an agent before booking who confirmed the availability of seats with extra leg space as I was travelling with 2 kids by myself. Of course, after paying and booking the air Transat agent said there were only 2 seats available and I had to let go. Two agents were giving me conflicting information and I asked to speak with a manager- they said you will have to wait an ""unknown"" amount of time which can be a few hours! It was also disappointing that a aircraft with a long flight to Europe did not offer a bassinet. They claim the seats are bigger in this new aircraft but I did not feel that was the case. I also tried to modify our return booking- I wasn't able to do so via the App or website, I kept on getting an error message and had to call customer service and wait for more than an hour. I travel a lot and this is by far the worst airline service- never to be repeated.",,,,,
"  I booked my air Transat flight going to Montreal from Calgary, didn’t get any online check in notification from my home 24 hrs before my flight but I was there almost 2 hour my flight. 12:45 pm I was in the line at 11am before waited in line half n hour after when it’s my turn to check in desk lady put me in the system, she is like boarding is already closed. I was like I was waiting in the line from half n hour how come boarding is closed so early she said now we can’t do anything their staff really need some training. I paid almost 450$. I was trying to contact their customer service the waiting time was 3 hours. Than I have to book another flight for same day I paid 1000$ for my domestic flight my flight was going to Montreal from Calgary. Montreal to calgary what happened in Montréal airport on June 1 Wednesday is I was waiting in the line from 2 hrs my flight was 8:35pm I was there at 6:30 waiting in line from 1.5 hr lady after checking my id and ticket, she said I cannot find you in the system. After taking my 20 mins she gave me boarding pass, how come she find me in the system now they really have to improve. I will never book another ticket with them.",,,,,
"  Tried to call them dozens of times over the past month and they simply never answer their phone. Not been able to speak to a single person, despite waiting hours on the line. Contacted them via social and they say you have to call to make changes and that's the only number. Don't even know if they actually exist. It's cost me hundreds of dollars now in phone charges and increased prices. Would complain, but they tell you to call...AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",,,,,
"  Manchester to Vancouver via Toronto. Where do I start, first booked in 2019 direct flight business class to Vancouver, return from Calgary to Manchester, economy class. Due to covid had to rebook year by year till last year when it looked that our holiday would go ahead. After change of flight times resulting in a cancellation of a hotel, and a 17hr stop over in Toronto tried to speak to someone after several hours on the phone on hold gave up. Finally after a £30 phone call got through to a most unpleasant person who was no help at all. Then they informed me that the plane model has changed for our flight from Manchester and that we were moved to economy class not being happy tried to contact them again no success the web site is rubbish and their app a joke it doesn't even recognise our booking number (after they said several times it would be sorted) and we have less than 3 weeks to fly. How they get to be the best service? God only knows I would never repeat never recommend Air Transat to anybody.",,,,,
 Toronto to Manchester. Great flight excellent service on board and at the desk. Attendants were helpful and kind to us old couple. The only thing was the seat cushions were VERY uncomfortable.,,,,,
"  Air Transat moved my flight to an earlier time several weeks after booking, which messed up all of my reservations at the other end. Several weeks later, Air Transat cancelled my club class reservation and offered to replace it for an economy seat. The refund that was offered did not reflect the cost difference between an economy seat and club class seat at the time of booking, which is daylight robbery. I haven't been away in a while and travelling to America is a once in a lifetime experience, so I thought I'd treat myself, but Air Transat have done their best to ruin the start of my trip. Make sure you book with a different airline as these people will mess you about. I wish I'd listened to the other reviews.",,,,,
"  Returning May, 27/ 2022, from the Dominican Republic, flight 187 arriving in Toronto at 4:45 PM. We stayed in the aircraft for to hours because of the backup of the security. They’ve told us they would put water in the toilets, not so people were looking. After the 2 hours wait, the captain announced, we can board people with children from 12 and under. Not so, even the older once went. Nobody came back. After a while 50 of the rest could go, etc there was a group of people, on the aircraft returning from a wedding, Standing and making it difficult for others to get by, even-so they were told to sit down. Mask was mandatory, but not for some people. One lady was yelling, shots, shots, and open the bottle of liquor. Finally as we elderly people got to the exit, we complained to the Captain and staff, they were with their sarcasm just laughing.",,,,,
  I was travelling on last Friday(attached doc) from Toronto to Montreal. And when i went to take my boarding pass in Toronto the air Transat person said that we have less space in airplane you can submit you cabin bag for free. I  submitted and when i reached in Montreal at around 7:30 i waited 1 hour near the belt and there was literally no one to help. There was no counter for air Transat help. I asked some other person they just said we don't work for the company we don't know. I went to the departure place just to see if there is someone there if they can help as all my original documents were there in my bag and i could not afford to loose them. I went upstairs where they give boarding passes said you have to call air Transat we are not responsible for your luggage. I called air Transat and there was no one again to help on call.  I felt helpless no one was even ready to listen. And after i was literally crying aloud then when one of person got up and took my boarding pass picture and went to check and he found my bag.,,,,,
"  On May 17th my wife and I flew from Rome to Toronto on flight 309. My wife had been injured in a fall the previous day and was experiencing acute pain due to three breaks in her upper right arm. When the Air Transat onboard staff realized her situation, they showed deep concern and compassion for her comfort and well being. During the 8+ hour flight at least one of the onboard staff would check on her on a regular basis. Kind gestures such as exhibited by the Air Transat staff were deeply appreciated. Because of the service we received I would not hesitate to recommend Air Transat at any time. Going forward, my wife and I will certainly enquire as to the availability of Air Transat when planning our next vacation. ",,,,,
"  Terrible airline experience. Wife and I prepaid to select seats together as she has an anxiety disorder and is terrified of flying. They changed our seats for return flight without notifying us to separate ends of the plane with no notice, being quite rude, and no refund offered. Agent could not inform why this occurred or direct us where to ask for a refund. Have still not been contacted (I've contacted them without response) or offered refund for extra paid to select the seats. My wife had an anxiety attack on the return flight, again, no accommodation, refund, or even apology. Was told its not their problem by agent prior to flight. Also lost my luggage for the week of the vacation with no follow up or compensation. Horrendous customer service. Would never recommend.",,,,,
" I had 2 major surgeries in Puerto Vallarta and was in a lot of pain. We just needed to get home. The stewardesses, went above and beyond to help us, one let me get a personal water bottle and both of them kept checking on my husband and I. I was last to deboard and they both helped us. I can't say enough on how grateful we were that they took the time to care with do much sincerity.",,,,,
"  Very unhappy with Air Transat and their lack of professionalism, plane left over 50 minutes late due to waiting on one of the pilots arrival. We boarded 40 minutes late than sat on the tarmac waiting for another 45 minutes. Asked one of the Cabin attendants why the delay and he just shrugged his shoulders and brushed me off, no apology or reason. I understand that there are delays and issues from time to time but this is not acceptable. ",,,,,
"  The airline attendants were the most ignorant, rude and unprofessional people I have ever met. I would not recommend flying what Air Transat. I'm hoping my flight home is much more enjoyable, an awful way to start off a 10-day vacation in Montego Bay. I had to actually walk away from one attendant because she was just so nasty to my girls.",,,,,
"  My wife requires a wheelchair and Air Transat was informed. To their credit, an Air Transat employee was on hand departing Toronto, arriving and departing Cancun. They were all excellent in assisting us. Then we arrived back in Toronto. A young man met us at the plane's doors. He had no idea what he was doing and only with my help did he negotiate the ramps. Then he wheeled us to an elevator down an empty corridor. Unfortunately I had to use the washroom at that point and he left us us there saying he had to check n any other passengers who needed assistance. I used the facilities but security wouldn't allow me to return to my wife. 20 minutes later, an elevator arrived near where I was frantically trying to get some help. Another passenger was pushing my wife's wheelchair. The Air Transat assistant never came back. That SOB left a mobility needy senior alone in a corridor for nearly 20 minutes. Subsequently, I was unable to talk to an Air Transat agent on the phone. Talking to a real person is nearly impossible. Everything else about our flight to and from Canxun was fine but what a way to finish off the first vacation we've had in 45 years.",,,,,
 Lisbon to Toronto. Air Transat didn't even offer a coffee or tea on a transatlantic flight! Unbelievable. We didn't even have the right to drink a glass of wine or beer. Unacceptable! When you call Air Transat there is the same recording for 1 year or more than the waiting time will be more than 1 hour. Unacceptable! How many employees do they have? They always give you that same chewy disgusting pizza before landing. We are not animals. What's wrong with Air Transat? It used to be synonymous with a good time. Now it has become a real nightmare It will be my last choice from now on.,,,,,
" Where do I even start.... what a horrible airline. I will 100% not be flying with this company anymore. We were flying with about 40 guests for our destination wedding when 2 days before our departure flight my grandmother had a heart attack and 3 of our family members had to stay back to ensure my grandmother was okay in the hospital. Trying to change/cancel/get a credit for these flights home was horrible. No one would take our call and when asked said we did not cancel in their 24 hour policy, yet we sent numerous emails and calls at the 48 hour mark of our departure. No one was willing to call back or email. Our family members are still in Costa Rica uncertain when they will be arriving home. All Air Transat needed to do was to change their flight or provide a credit. However instead of applying these changes they were rude, unprofessional. During a hard and very uncertain time it would of been nice to have an airline that wanted to make your arrival home easy. It’s just funny since one of the family members who had to cancel their flight was traveling with Air Canada and they ended up getting a credit for their return flight home. I just want to warn anyone traveling with this company to think twice!",,,,,
 Such an awful airline with 0 customer service! How can they change the time of our flight so significantly twice and fail to tell us the second time around? Is an email to notify your customers too much of a task for you? Absolute joke!,,,,,
"  A terrible experience with ""customer service"". If you need help from Air Transat, forget about it - you are on your own. We booked a package with Air Transat (flight and accommodation). While at the airport departing to come home my son (a minor) received a false positive COVID test the day of our departure. Not the airlines fault, clearly. That same day I was able to get a letter from the local health authority authorizing him to fly the following morning. After being on hold for over two hours, Air Transat would not help rebook and effectively said ""we don't care, not our problem"". No attempt to re-book a flight out, nothing. We ended up booking on another carrier to get back home. Air Transat literally abandoned a minor. This airline is not worth a second look.",,,,,
"  My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at the Barcelo Maya Palace Resort. The flight from Toronto to Cancun on February 3, 2023 was flawless. On our return date on February 17, 2022, we were supposed to be picked up at the resort by included shuttle as notified by the App the day before at 8.30am. The shuttle arrived late and picked up a family but we were left stranded by the driver who informed us that we were not on the list and he had no room for us as the shuttle was full. A cab was dispatched that brought us to the Airport for $75 American dollars. I was given a receipt by the driver. At the Air Transat check in kiosk, I spoke with an Air Transat representative at the kiosk. She acted promptly and she personally took the time to speak with the Air Transat people at a nearby office and immediately was able to reimburse me for the cost of the taxi. Great customer service. I have flown with Air Transat in the past and I will continue to do so in the future. All around, great customer service. Thank you.",,,,,
" Ft Lauderdale to Toronto. What a pleasant experience from the Fort Lauderdale counter to the plane. At the Fort Lauderdale the staff was so humble and funny while he was checking all our paperwork. He took our stress away. On the plane, the staff were super amazing to handle my kids inquiries. They answered them very professionally. We received sanitizers pack and complementary drinks. I needed that so much so as my kids. Very polite. Plane entertainment system! I wasn’t aware Air Transat has entertainment for free! You can bring your own headphones and Voila you have hours of entertainments! Last ten years I have been traveling to Florida twice a year to my parents it’s just a three hour flight so never experienced this type of awesome service. My kids didn’t have any headphones the flight attendant provided headphones for free! It was getting better and better! Thank you Air Transat for your awesome service. I will be traveling soon in March to Punta Cana! Hopefully I will be able to travel with you guys again.",,,,,
"  Worst customer service I've ever experienced. I have been trying to reach them for two days, waited for more than an hour, and they either hang up or never answer. I needed to cancel a flight and get a travel credit, which they said I could at the time of the reservation, and the only contact they provide is this.",,,,,
"  I am writing about a forthcoming trip and the impossibility to contact Air Transat. Trip: Montreal-Nantes/Bordeaux-Montreal, France. Reservation made August 2021, departure 5 June 2022. Recently, I received an itinerary change (date/time change) notification from Air Transat. Now, when I check 'My Booking', I get the message: ""Booking cannot be found"". The only way AT offers contact service is by telephone, but, the wait is 3++ hours and when choosing the 'call-back' option, no-one calls back. They have removed their email contact service from the website. This is a pre-paid trip and I am worried that this is a pre-bankruptcy ploy by the company to steal our money and avoid all obligations to their customers. ",,,,,
"  I have flown with Air Transat over the past 20 years. Like most people we had to cancel trips during Cocvid-19. My complaint is how to contact Air Transat. I have been on hold for 4.75 hours, many times, waiting to talk to them to resolve an issue. Still haven't got through. I decided lets try an email, nowhere is there a contact email visible on the web site. Their phone message says there is one. This website link should be on the front page so customers can email them direct, instead of waiting 4-5 hours. ",,,,,
"  I made my reservation online couples of weeks ego. I need to confirm everything before I leave on the 28th because I am leaving from Montreal and do not wish to make the trip without making sure that all is good. And also have some questions regarding luggage and prices. because on the website it says that the 3rd piece of luggage would be 235$. I understand the 1 being 35, 2nd being 65$ but the 3rd one being 235$ is a bit tough. I have being waiting on hold for online for 42hrs already for the past 3 days with no answer and a very very irritating horrible music. I have tried the chat yesterday Oct 18th where I waited almost 2 hours to the point that I forgot about and when about doing my stuff ... someone answered but I wasn't there so I missed it. I have to say that the airlines are taking for granted that people want to travel but, eventually we will get fed up with the bad services.",,,,,
" I flew on flight TS932 from Toronto to Vancouver in August 2021 and the flight attendants were rude and unsafe. The flight was packed, and half the flight was not wearing masks. The flight attendants made no effort at all to ask people to put their masks on, I felt very unsafe. One of the flight attendants stopped to have a conversation with the couple beside me in French. They complained about how rude and unfriendly people from Ontario are, they said people from Ontario are lazy for not learning French, the flight attendant agreed and said that our accents are so terrible when we speak French that we shouldn’t even try. After that conversation the flight attendant gave the couple beside me free wine and beer. I found that entire conversation to be extremely insulting and ignorant, they assumed that no one on the flight could speak French simply because we were flying out of Toronto. On top of all of this the man in front of me reclined his seat fully, and was basically laying in my lap the entire flight, I’m not sure why they built the chairs like that, but it is not covid safe. ",,,,,
"  If you download there site it makes it so easy to know what to do, it removed a lot of stress for me has you know Covid restriction keeps on changing but they are always on the ball service. On the plane excellent, we want to thank our 2 stewards flight 837, Nicholas and Eric, two nice guy that gave us excellent customer service. We are flying again in March with them not premium class this time but I’m sure the experience will be the same. Thank you for making our trip memorable from the beginning through the end.",,,,,
 I booked a flight with them and bought 2 pieces of luggage. They rescheduled my flight with another airline with 1 luggage and told me to buy the second luggage yourself and we will refund you. It’s been almost a year that they did not process my claim while they say their process time is up to 3 months. They no longer answer the calls. I was on hold waiting for more than 2 hours twice.,,,,,
"  I bought an Air Transat ticket through Expedia (big mistake -- Expedia is the worst.) It says on the itinerary that Air Transat changes are free and on AT's website, they say all flights/all ticket classes include free changes if purchased before August 31, 2021. (Mine was purchased in May 2021.) Expedia is denying the free change. I waited an hour on the phone with Air Transat for them to say it's not their issue but Expedia's. If you sell through Expedia, you're responsible. The agent on the phone said that the only way to resolve these issues is by conference call with both Expedia and Air Transat. I asked how I could do that and she said she did not know how it's possible to arrange such a conference call. ",,,,,
"  Since I was a kid I traveled with this airline, we always had the same carry-ons, but this time we had to register two of them as normal baggage, because the wheels couldn't fit in the small box sizing them, which meant we had to pay another 40$/luggage. After explaining ourselves, we said we would like to pay for one of them only, because if we knew, we would've brought one bigger luggage that fits the containing of both carry-ons. Not wanting to understand, the only thing the supervisor could say was: ""These are the policies, we understand but we can't do anything"" he talked to us as if we had no understanding of anything that was going on, he would repeat the same exact thing in the same condescending monotone way for about 5 times. After understanding he would not want to do anything to accommodate, I told him ""Ok, you can leave then"". His reaction was : going behind the counter and asking the person working under him ""what is their security number"" as if we did something that requires security. I literally just said, ""Ok, you can leave then"". I am still amazed that a supervisor would have this reaction, I think he was trying to find a way to intimidate us. Also, just so you know, don't register or verify your carry-ons, just take them with you, pass the customs, and they will take them for free at the boarding area.",,,,,
"  My flight was canceled for COVID-19 back in March of 2020. I was approved for a refund, but they refunded to a card that was paid off and closed. My bank refused the refund, so the money was sent back to Air Transat. Air Transat refuses to provide me with a refund through another route, they have stopped answering my chat messages, and ""coincidentally"" my calls are now dropped every time I call customer service. They had told me getting a letter from my bank confirming the refund was refused would help. I sent the letter via email to the correct address given, checked in two times since, and still have not received a response there either. They have essentially blocked me on all avenues of communication, even though I was never rude or confrontational.",,,,,
"  The flight I booked was cancelled as a result of Covid. I requested a refund which was rejected by Air Transat, instead they offered a credit for future travel. I spend my winters in Mexico and Air Transat is no longer flying to Mexico, a credit is useless to me. I only fly to Mexico.",,,,,
"  My flight was from Montreal to France and was schedule to depart in September 2020. Due to covid 19 the flight was cancelled. Vouchers were sent for us to make reservations in the next 2 years instead of giving us back our money. The reservation was for 4 people and was nearly 3K Can. dollars. We had pay well in advance approx. 6 months before the scheduled flight, Air Transat did not make any effort in re-paying its customers. They kept our money for over 1 year, until the government of Canada bailed them out. We have finally received our money back in May 2021. I am very upset that Air Transat kept our money and refused to give us back our money when the flight was cancelled. I will never, ever, ever book a flight with this company again, and I will never, ever recommend anyone from using Air Transat for a vacation or a flight, and this goes for all of the Canadian airline companies which use their customers money as a bargaining chip to negotiate with the government! ",,,,,
  We booked for a 3 week vacation. After 6 days at resort we received an email telling us we had to come home at the end of 2 weeks with a full refund for 1 week hotel accommodation credited to our credit card. Several emails and phone calls and no response to either myself or my travel agent. We have been home for 10 weeks. Outrageous customer service. Right now not certain will use again! Especially after they changed our departure airport from London to Toronto and only offer take it or leave it offer. Cost us extra money for Hotel and food both for departure and arrival. Plus: hour drive both ways and we are Seniors.,,,,,
"  Still waiting for a refund. My family and I were due to fly on 25th July, 2020. Flight was cancelled. I was promised a refund on 5th August but advised it would take 16 weeks. 7 months later nothing. Utterly appalling behaviour. ",,,,,
"  Has Anyone actually received a refund from Air Transat ? We were due to fly from London Gatwick to Vancouver on 1st October 2020, but they cancelled the flight. On 2nd September 2020 they informed me I would receive a refund. I am still waiting. It is now the beginning of February,. This is very bad customer service.",,,,,
  5 months later and still no refund for cancelled flight. I get that covid is an issue but 5 months is disgusting. Spoke to them and incredibly unhelpful and wouldn't even tell me who I was speaking to. Will never use again. Stick with reputable airlines.,,,,,
" Very disappointed. You would think that the airline would make an effort regarding customer service amid a pandemic and higher uncertainty regarding travel dates. I needed to switch dates for my round trip and I was willing to pay an extra fee, and they were very rude and refused to make any change even with high additional charges. Will not book with them again.",,,,,
  I booked a flight only to have it cancelled days later. When I called a few weeks after to follow up on the refund they told me it would be several months as they are currently still catching up on refunds from March! Almost as if they are only selling flights for the quick cash just to cancel them? Absolutely disgusting. They have lost my trust and my business. I will never fly with them again and will encourage everyone I know to go with more respectable airlines. Do yourself a favour and save your money!,,,,,
"  Very disappointed with the customer service of Air Transat. They cancelled our flight due to COVID19 and do not give us the full refund and only offer a voucher. According to Canadian Law, if the contract is frustrated, customers have the right to receive full refund, but the airline does not want to take this into consideration. Even though, my was from Orlando and US DOT require airlines to provide full refund due to the COVID19, they do not care to follow the requirement.",,,,,
  Very disappointed to learn after Air Transat cancelled our flight no refund would be issued - only a credit. I realize Covid-19 is an extreme situation but it is extreme for family as well. In the USA - the agency responsible for the airline industry had the backs of every American when the airlines attempted to do the same. The Dept of transportation (DOT) required airlines to issue refunds. So disappointed that the Canadian Transportation Authority will not require the same. We have enjoyed the direct flights to many destinations through Toronto but will not be flying in the future. We will stick to US flights to ensure we are covered financially should an event to this magnitude occur again. Fellow travelers - Buffalo and Niagara Falls airport is only a little more than an hour away - consider protecting your airline investment in the future by flying through the US! Good luck and stay healthy.,,,,,
"  This review is not about the airline, aircraft, flight crew, etc. The flights were excellent. It is about Air Transats affiliation with Europcar car rental company.  They caused us problems during our 6 week vacation in Portugal plus they are still, almost a month since we returned home, charging our credit card with a $600 unauthorized charge. Also we have been trying to recover our ""security deposit"" of 300 euros that was promised after the car was returned. They correspond but don't answer questions as to the extra charges on our credit card. I checked the reviews for this company and 89% of the people reviewed gave it the lowest rating possible, many with similar complaints regarding questionable & probably illegal credit card charge transactions.",,,,,
"  Calgary to Cancun. Extremely dissatisfied with Air Transat regarding their integrity - lack there of. Flew from Calgary to Cancun, checked-in one suitcase. When awaiting my baggage in Cancun, it took a substantial amount of time for the bag to come on the belt. When I finally retrieved my suitcase, I found the lock broken, and items stolen from my bag. I immediately contacted the airline, and was told to wait at least 6 weeks for a response. I received a letter back apologizing, but said I need to work with my travel insurance company for any liability, as stolen items are not covered by the airline.  I left my luggage in the care of the airline - and this is what happens. I'm very disappointed in the lack of resolution and lack of seriousness from the airline.",,,,,
"  Lisbon to Toronto. Thank you to the crew operating flight TS 733 on Monday March 16th. Amazing service. Despite the corona virus fears, this crew worked intensely to maintain a positive attitude. We waited for almost 2 hours in the plane upon arrival due to the high number of passengers at Customs. The Captain kept all passengers informed and calm. Thank you !",,,,,
"  I purchased 8 tickets to travel from Vancouver to Cancun in April 2020, due to covid-19 situation three of our company can’t make it. Called Air Transat and explained the situation and requested Credit for 3 tickets, just credit for future tickets not a refund. The answer was no and I had to let $2000 go to waste and told that they can’t to anything. I was expecting a little help in this situation.",,,,,
" Victoria Falls to Harare. Never choose this company. Departure times cannot be relied. Our flight departed 3.5 hours earlier than it should've. We were only informed the previous day in the evening. We couldn't make it to the flight and went to the airport to book a new one. Customer service at the airport was terrible. The staff was arrogant and shouted at us. Also, there was supposed to be another flight with Air Zimbabwe that day, but for no reason they didn't fly it. Don't choose this airline.",,,,,
"  When we purchased our ticket online we were not informed that we would be flying direct from Victoria Falls to Johannesburg however it was explained to us at airport check-in that the flight was was Victoria Falls > Bulawayo > Jo'burg. The flight was delayed about 30 minutes in Vic Falls and we deplaned when we arrived at Bulawayo Airport and eventually re-boarded a larger plane. Communication wasn’t great but we spoke with another passenger who took this flight more regularly and this was apparently the norm. Aside from the fact that it was ""free seat"" meaning pick any available seat regardless of what was indicated on boarding pass, the flight went well. I would not recommend this flight if you have a tight connection, it would be wise to leave yourself sufficient room for delays. Most countries charge a departure tax when leaving by air. Often the tax is automatically added to the airline ticket price but not always, as is the case with Air Zimbabwe so be prepared to pay 50USD, cash before going through security.",,,,,
"  Harare to Johannesburg. I had a very bad experience with Air Zimbabwe and particularly the agent through which I bought my ticket - Geostar (a Portuguese agent). I booked a flight for 7am from Harare, and the flight was postponed indefinitely. Upon arriving at the airport, the front desk cashier demanded $50 airport taxes be paid in addition to the ticket that was already bought. Neither Geostar nor Air Zimbabwe bothered to inform me of the change in travel times. After requesting a refund, it has been 28 days of back and forth emails from the agent and the airline. No concrete answers or commitment. Just incorrect credit notes being sent to me.",,,,,
"  I enjoyed my flight aboard Air Zimbabwe from Harare to Johannesburg, the crew were very friendly and the service was excellent. We arrived ahead of schedule, check-in was fast and smooth and the seats were comfortable. ",,,,,
" Harare to Johannesburg with Air Zimbabwe. Tickets on Air Zimbabwe are not cheaper than other airlines. At the airport you will need to pay an additional US$50 per person than if you fly using another airline. This is because Air Zimbabwe has not paid the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe (CAAZ) the taxes for past passengers so now the CAAZ obtains these taxes directly from passengers as they are about to leave. If you fly BA or SAA, these taxes are included in the tickets. Also note that online ticket websites (we used GoToGate) do not publish the additional US$50 or any such information on their sites so that you purchase tickets through them only to receive a very nasty surprise at Harare airport. The flight experience on Air Zimbabwe itself was not bad.",,,,,
With an unexpected weekend off in Harare and Victoria Falls beckoning Air Zim was the only option so we took a deep breath and booked. Outbound flight on 27-year-old B732 which left the stand with the precision of a Swiss train at 0800 and zero seconds. Served a reasonable snack and coffee and on-time arrival. Return flight on Sunday was on a leased E145 fully booked with departure from the stand 5 minutes early and again nice snack and drink en route. The crew was 75% SAA. Overall could have no complaints at all.,,,,,
Living and working in South Africa I fly home to Zimbabwe fairly often and try to be patriotic and use the national airline. I have only been delayed once in the past year. Food is good and service also of acceptable standards. Ggetting through to the Joburg offices is another story altogether - overall I think Air ZIm are doing the best they can with the resources at their disposal.,,,,,
Harare-London-Harare. Originally booked flight on Friday which was cancelled. Flights were punctual and staff friendly. Old planes and no entertainment. But being the only direct flight to Europe from Harare and with prices less then half of any other airline still OK for anybody wanting a cheap flight to London as long as one has the flexibility to cope with changes of schedule.,,,,,
I was on my flight back from London. There is never any inflight entertainment on your long haul journeys and yet they is a projector onboard - very disappointing. One of the flight attendants back chats when I ask for a refreshment because I could not sleep - he tells me sir do you know it is four in the morning! It is not good to arrive at the airport and get told that the aircraft has to stop over in Lusaka to refuel!.,,,,,
I thought I would try out Air Zimbabwefrom Harare as it is a direct flight to London and I dislike the long wait at Joburg airport when flying SAA/BA etc. However having had my Wednesday night flight postponed until Thursday then that cancelled until Friday then Friday flight cancelled without a single reason or apology. I figure 5 hours in Joburg is a small price to pay. Shame on you Air Zimbabwe. Never again.,,,,,
As I write I cannot even express my feelings because of the mannerism of Air Zimbabwe staff. I was bound on a flight from Harare to Bulawayo on 15 March and little did I know that I was going to lose all the things I was travelling to get in Bulawayo. I did not go to Bulawayo after all because the flight was supposedly overbooked. I was there in time for check in - ie. one and a half hours early. I was in the queue only to be advised that the flight was now full. To my disgust the airport staff were not even helpful. We were then told that they might be a flight at 1:30pm that will travel to Vic Falls and then get to Bulawayo around 10:30 pm. I needed to be in Bulawayo at 10am. Why weren't we told that there was a plane down early enough for us to find alternative transport. To add insult to injury I am told I can't get my refund until after six weeks. This was not my fault. The inefficiency of Air Zimbabwe leaves a lot to be desired.,,,,,
Return trip to Harare and a satisfying experience on both occasions. I geared myself up for what I prejudged would be an awful flight it was cheap so decided to take the risk. I am pleased to say my flight was extremely enjoyable. The food staff all friendly and highly efficient the captain - a lady entertainment and most importantly the wine was all brilliant.,,,,,
"21st December 2006. My wife and I booked our flight in May 2006 and duly arrived at Gatwick for our scheduled 6pm flight. We got through baggage check in having waited over 2 hours then 90 minutes getting through security and passport control. Entered departure lounge but no information on screens about our flight. We decided to go to gate 34 which was printed on our boarding pass and met all the other travellers but no Air Zimbabwe staff or representatives in sight. It was only when a fellow passenger got through to Air Zimbabwe London on her mobile phone that we were told the flight had been cancelled for ""technical reasons"" .We had to go through passport control and baggage reclaim as if we had just arrived at Gatwick and then join a huge queue of weary travellers at the Air Zimbabwe agency to see what was going on. It would have taken hours to be seen so we reluctantly went home. On the 22nd December we made 50 plus calls to Air Zimbabwe Gatwick but whoever eventually picked up the phone just put the receiver down without saying anything! Eventually Air Zimbabwe London answered and promised to call me with information that day which they did and informed me categorically that we were on the11am flight on Saturday 23rd December. We duly arrived at Gatwick at 6am and waited for the Air Zimbabwe check in to open. By 9am no sign of any check in so more frantic calls to Air Zimbabwe Gatwick and London. Gatwick office were not answering and London were closed for the weekend! Another traveller got hold of Air Zimbabwe Harare and was told there was a flight at 5.30 that day. Eventually an Air Zim check in opened at 2.15pm and literally hundreds of people queued many more than the plane could carry! Scores of people jumped the queue and mayhem ensued. Eventually the airport security announced that the flight was for those who had not travelled on the 21st December and anyone else would not fly that day! You can imagine the impact that had on those with tickets to fly that day. Eventually we got to the departure lounge and to our gate for boarding. An hour later an Air Zimbabwe spokesman announced the crew had been delayed and would be with us soon. An hour later they arrived in one's and two's and eventualy we boarded the aircraft only to be told by the captain that the baggage had yet to be loaded ! We eventually took off at 10.30pm after spending over 16 hours at Gatwick at our second attempt to get to our destination .Consequently we will never ever fly Air Zimbabwe again and urge other would be passengers to think again .",,,,,
I took my friend to London-Gatwick on 24-12-06. He was expecting to fly with Air Zimbabw eat 1900 hrs that evening & arrive in Harare at 7am on Christmas day. On trying to check in we realised there were 2 separate queues one for those with tickets for 23 Dec and one for those with tickets for 24 Dec. That is all the information that was given and no explanation - even though there was only one flight scheduled for Harare that evening. We waited for 4 hrs only to be told that those with tickets for 24 Dec were not flying because their plane had been given to those whose flight had been cancelled the previous day!?,,,,,
What a disgrace of an airline Air Zimbabwe has become. We have had three incidents with this 'joke' of an air line in as many weeks. Flights delayed by many hours leaving Harare then diverting to Kenya to refuel and finally arriving in London up to 8 HOURS later than scheduled arrival. Flights to Harare from London delayed by 24 hours and a total attitude of indifference shown by Air Zimbabwe officials in London. My advice to anyone thinking of flying to and from Harare with Air Zimbabwe - DO NOT fly with this ghastly airline. Chose BA or SAA.,,,,,
My daughter flew as an unaccompanied minor HRE-LGW return. On her trip here her plane was delayed by 2hrs 30mins which resulted in her father having to wait all that time. On arrival the plane due at 07:40hrs landed at 09:25hrs and she only emerged shortly after 11a.m after being delayed in passport control and the baggage hall when she was travelling on an EEA Family Member Permit she had no baggage but had to wait because there was only one escort available to take seven children through to arrivals! Next time it'll be SAA or BA I'd rather pay extra knowing she'll be on time and well looked after.,,,,,
"The last three flights on Air Zimbabwe that my wife and/or myself have been on have been an absolute disaster. Flights cancelled and delayed have been the norm. Reaction from Air Zimbabwe have been explained away as ""Operational Reasons beyond their control"" . What rubbish they have all been the result of the incompetence of their management. To any one considering flying Air Zimbabwe I recommend you consider other options.",,,,,
I've travelled to Zimbabwe on many occasions both for business and vacation. Given the terrible state of that country's economy I think the airline does a very creditable job. They can't compete against the likes of BA with the resources at their disposal but I found the flight crews to be very pleasant and attentive. They try hard to please and do their best at all times. I do find the temperature in the aircraft to be a bit on the warm side but it does at least prepare you for the heat of Zimbabwe which can be a surprise when you exit the arrivals hall. Checking in at LGW is reasonably smooth given that most returning Zimbabweans want to take far more on the plane than their allowance. Checking in at HRE has improved since the construction of the new terminal and the Air Zim staff are pleasant and efficient. What I do find as a shocking contrast is the unfailing hostility shown by the various gov't officials one encounters at HRE both arriving and departing. The Zim Gov't must make special efforts to recruit unpleasant staff to deal with British Citizens as it's quite obvious we're singled out for the maximum delays questions customs searches etc. Being unwelcome in the country is made very clear by the Immigration and Customs officials; completely the opposite of the attitude of most of the population.,,,,,
We booked my 75-year old mother to fly Harare-Gatwick return. The flight to Gatwick was great with everything going very smoothly. The flight from Gatwick back to Harare however was diverted via Rome to pick up Comrade Bob (Mugabe) and the arrival in Harare was delayed by over hours. This meant that my mother (who was in a wheelchair) missed her connecting flight to Bulawayo and had to wait until the next flight which was scheduled to take off some 10 hours later! But Comrade Bob (Mugabe) appeared on the scene and the connecting flight was delayed by a further 2 hours! Never again !,,,,,
I'll not try again in a while. They owe me a lot in apology / reimbursements. I tried to recover costs incurred from several of the many cancellations of a flight that was suppose to have been used by my family to England. This also happened to my friends when they tried to be patriotic as well.,,,,,
Thought I'd be patriotic and flew Air Zimbabwe for the first time between London Gatwick and Harare. Disappointed must be the understatement of the century to put it mildly. I arrived at Gatwick at 16.30hrs for the 19.00hrs flight only to be told that the flight had been delayed and was now scheduled to leave at 2am Friday morning. At check -in we were graced with £5 refreshment vouchers. We waited patiently for 2am nothing happened. After numerous and ridiculous excuses such as the aircraft had been chartered to Ghana Airways had landed at Heathrow and taxis not finding their way to the hotel where the crew was we finally left Gatwick at 4am and arrived in Harare at 1500hrs. What an experience. All I can say is never again.,,,,,
I flew domestically between several destinations in Zimbabwe and thought Air Zimbabwe was decent enough. The aircraft were newish Fokker 50's and a 707 that was uncomfortable. I was surprised we were given snacks and drinks even on flights that were half an hour or less. The service was better than average and despite old airport facilities the crew were organized and there were no major delays. This is all flying domestically though - I don't know if the international service is worse.,,,,,
3 return flights between Zimbabwe and the UK. Harare to UK journey of a high standard with excellent and caring crew fairly good catering standards and comfortable piloting. Opposite to that is the regional flight to and fro Harare and Bulawayo. It's extremely uncomfortable with the plane causing you to practically shake all over. Conversation is fine but there is need for passengers to be encouraged to lower their volumes for the sake of the ill aged and sleepy.,,,,,
Flew Air Zimbabwe VFA-HRE then HRE-MRU return. All flights were on Boeing 737-200 aircraft - showing their age but quite comfortable. Drinks service on all flights crisps and peanuts on the VFA-HRE route (a short hop) hot meals on Mauritius flights. Cabin crew were attentive and helpful. On the downside MRU-HRE flight was delayed 30 minutes but no explanations were given until we were on the plane (this may be more the airport's fault) - and some lifejackets not properly secured under seats. Overall though service was better than expected.,,,,,
  I recently flew from Cebu to gold coast and I had to throw away a large amount of my carry on bag because it was over weight. My concern is not that I had to discard this stuff it's that the staff wouldn't let me do this and demanded I paid the extra at the gate. I watched them do this with a lot of people. I also watched them weigh guys laptop bags including mine but not ladies handbags. And by the time I threw away what I could I was still 800 grams over weight and they were fighting me on this till the end. When I asked to check the scales calibration they were reluctant and then let me go. ,,,,,
"  We had visa problems with Vietnam entry visa. The Air Asia staff , particularly Naruemon were extremely helpful in resolving the visa issue. This included making phone calls to Vietnam and assisting us with a new visa application online. Thank you very much for very helpful and friendly staff at Don Mueang airport.",,,,,
"  I purchased a Premium Economy seat and paid for a lie flat bed. Despite attempting to confirm my seats many times prior to departure, when checking in I was told that there are no lie flat beds on this flight. In fact the aircraft is only economy seating. I tried numerous times over a period of one week to contact their staff for a refund. Their chat bot is totally useless so I left messages, tried calling their overseas offices and always received just a voice message to leave a short message with email or phone number. Nothing! It's obvious that they cannot afford proper customer support service or are simply not interested and don't care. I have just checked online again for the same flights in September and they offer economy seats at $327 USD or premium economy at $853 USD. This airline has only one objective, take your money and if you have a problem don't contact us.",,,,,
" Low cost airline (or more like mid-cost in a post-COVID world) so expectations should be set accordingly but gets you from A to B. Mid-age aircraft, narrow seats and pitch, basic food available for purchase, and minimal service. Premium Flex is a waste of money as no check-in or boarding line-up or luggage priority as promised. Ticket changes or cancellation are painful.",,,,,
"  I tried to book directly with AirAsia and there was no way to add hold baggage online on my route Siem Reap via KUL - Sandakan, Borneo. So I booked expecting to be able to add it at the end. Then they wanted to charge 58USD per bag for a 2 hour flight. Then I tried to look up my booking on my AirAisa login and it said I do not have any booking! Then It took a awhile to find the ""other airlines"" bookings. They claim its booked with ""another airline"" not Air Asia. I tried to cancel the booking and their is no way to cancel. There is no email address, no contact number, no chat box. There is an autorobot called Bo, which gives multiple excuses as to why it cannot help you. First it says it timed out, then it said the flight is not with Air Asia but ""another airline"" and they have to check the rules of the other airline then it doesnt get back to you. At the airport, they restricted the baggage to 15kgs instead of 20kgs online and proceeded to charge an extortionate fee for each extra kilo. Then when we checked in they booked all of us including two children aged 9 in different seats all over the plane.",,,,,
"  To be honest, my overall experience with this airline is disappointing. It is a budget airline but due to hidden additional charges, it actually is not a budget one. The most terrible experience is their customer service. You are wasting your time chatting with a chatbot. My tickets were canceled due to Covid last 2020 and 2021. Until now, I did not receive any refund. They just keep on saying the status is in progress and will escalate it. ",,,,,
" Worst airline in Asia, in terms of punctuality and service. I have encountered flight cancelled without refund (as nobody answers your queries its just a stupid bot), flight delayed without announcement, they irresponsibly made passengers wait and wait for hour at the boarding gate knowing connecting flight or arrival pick up would be affected. As a passenger, it's very poor management overall which made me concerned about the safety too. They also has a very lousy baggage weighing system that slows everyone down by making passengers repack their duty free into another bag but not necessarily cutting any weight. Price wise is good. But no value as they frequently cancel or delay flight without any refund. They should change their tag line from #everyone can fly To #fly at your own risk.",,,,,
 I have always found Air Asia over the years to be very clinical. Always on time and you get what you pay for really. It’s a low cost carrier with no frills. I have never had any concerns to fly with them. That will continue to remain the same.,,,,,
"  Flight attendant, George was very considerate to promptly change available front seats for us upon seeing my elderly mother struggle to walk. Appreciate the thoughtfulness.",,,,,
 Air Asia website has taken such a step backwards it's infuriating. No customer service to top it off. Trying to book seats on the plane and keep getting payment / booking error trying 3 different credit cards and the same issue again and again,,,,,
" Totally disrespectful to its customers, rescheduling flights many times to many hours from its scheduled time and no solution. It used to be good and punctual, but now avoid this airline at all cost.",,,,,
"  Worst airline ever, changed the flight time three times, so in the end we were not able to take the flight due to the airline constant timing changes. We had to buy tickets with another airline, and chose the refund that was presented by AirAsia as an option. After months of emailing we never received even a reply on the sent emails, and no refund was received.",,,,,
"  They deserve the title of best LLC in SE Asia. They have been doing this a long time, and still they are the best value for money with the best routes.",,,,,
 Very terrible experience with the check in crew. They wanted me to find a dust bin and put in the extra weight items which were sweets removed from my suitcase. They did not offer any support and the manager threatened me that she will not issue boarding pass if I don't do it.,,,,,
" Booked 7 flights with AirAsia around 4 months before my holiday. Around 2 month before the flights were supposed to take place the nightmare started. They started to cancel flights for ""technical reasons"" sometimes offering alternatives that were not too bad (same route, just a couple of hours earlier or later), sometimes they offered nothing. In the end of the 7 flights only 2 happened within 1h of the originally booked time. The highlight was a flight that was cancelled and begrudgingly I agreed to their alternative which was 14h earlier. After having re-arranged the other flights this affected, a couple of weeks before the flight, the alternative was moved to within 2h of the original flight's time. Even days before the flights they kept moving them around making my heart sink every time I got a message from AirAsia with the word urgent in the title. Their customer service chatbot is making it impossible to talk to a human or hand in a claim, you just go in circles with it offering you useless options. The positives were that if it was other AirAsia flights that were affected by these cancellations it was pretty painless to move them around and most of the flights were punctual.",,,,,
"  I was departing from the Kansai Osaka terminal 2. Terrible check in service. The person was in a terrible mood and it showed.  I checked in online and the website told me my check in was incomplete and I needed to check in at the counter. My turn in line came and the person took my passport. He asked for my seat number. I didn’t have it since my online check in was incomplete. We had a little dispute where he mentioned I needed to provide him a seat number and I told him I don’t have it and needed to complete my check in at the counter. I went to the colleague beside him since I just needed my tickets. He told his colleague to stop, asked me to stop wasting other people’s time, and told me to come back over. He eventually printed my tickets. Not to mention my checked in luggage was slightly off symmetrical from the luggage belt. He told me to adjust it. ",,,,,
" Rescheduled my flight at short notice. Sent an email saying the flight was rescheduled. Had a Flight Rescheduled Refund policy, refused to refund the flight because according to them 'the flight was not rescheduled on their end'.",,,,,
"  This airline has so many hidden fees, they will charge you fees plus penalty for any luggage weight exceeding 7 kg per passenger. The flight was a disaster with kids noise, and way too much passengers bags in the above-head compartments and under-seats storage.",,,,,
  AirAsia is weighing cabin baggage along with laptop bags and ladies hand bags. Any additional baggage beyond 7 kg (combined weight of cabin bag+ laptop+ ladies hand bag) is charged INR 1900 per kg. I faced this at Delhi Airport today. ,,,,,
" Worst airline I’ve ever flown with. I waited over 2 hours on gate K6 for departure however an announcement was made that the plane was delayed over 1 hour which I then waited patiently. 10 minutes before 5pm departure time I get an email stating plane departing from different gate which I headed to and missed the plane with my family and kids. I was then advised to go to level 3 and speak to AirAsia customer service to explain to them and they immediately requested that I pay 870RM as this is a special deal. All I can say is this airline is a total scam, stay away. I did rebook with AirAsia as now they were the only airline flying to Langkawi at 08:55pm however this time the plane was delayed 2.5 hours. Never again!",,,,,
"  Missed international connection because 3.5 hours late. Was supposed to fly at 10.00 am, delayed till 12.00 but actually took off at 13.30 hrs from Langkawi. Arrived Singapore 15.00 instead of 11-30 that’s 3.5 hrs late, my connection was 15.10 to Dubai. I left a gap of 3 plus hours for delays but obviously not enough. So cost me a fortune for onwards flight to Dubai and UK. So unreliable only realised when talking to other passengers it’s a common theme. lengthy delays and no show aircraft. Big mistake, will certainly not fly again with this airline.",,,,,
" The one hour delay of the flight was only communicated when I arrived at the airport, so I got stuck there. No apology or explanation in regards to the delay given, neither by gate staff, nor by the pilot. It’s the 2nd time this happened to me within a month, so it seems this has become the norm now. Otherwise uneventful flight.",,,,,
" For as much as I wish this was a positive letter about our experience with Air Asia, this is far from positive. And if I was able to give this airline a ZERO, I would. Plus this letter is written in behalf of my whole family of 18 who traveled to enjoy our trip to Palawan. On the morning of Sunday, April 23rd 2023, my sister in law pre-checked all of us in online prior to our arrival to the airport which she received an email confirming this check in to show at the counter. At approximately 1130 my family of 18 (included in this number was 7 children) of us traveling arrived at the Palawan Puerto Princesa Airport which was 3 hours prior to our departure back to Cebu Philippines which was around 1430, like everybody is instructed to do before every departure. At the time, they started calling for all passengers to check in their luggage for our flight, we arrived at the counter and my sister in law showed her our pre check in confirmation email. It was an overwhelming experience to our family. The policies and procedure were never clear. As the parting answer of the Manager, that the Pre-checked in option is never a guarantee that you will have a seat. My family and I took a 3 night trip to Palawan from Cebu. I, personally have traveled on numerous different airlines and never have I noticed so much unprofessionalism. And such a disappointment to most of my family members which was their first time ever being on a plane. Even though we had so much of a bad experience with Air Asia there is one police officer that show so much compassion, especially to my wife and sister in law, who were forced to stay back till they found another flight. Never again will we fly Air Asia.",,,,,
  Avoid at all costs! They cancelled my flight and put me on one that didn't work so requested a refund end of March 2022 and it is now April 2023 and still not received! They dont answer you or when they do it’s the usual your refund is being processed! This company is nothing but glorified thieves! Avoid.,,,,,
"  The airline is still processing a refund after 5 months. If you are lucky not to have your flight rescheduled and other issues, then you may be one of the few lucky ones. I am still waiting for my refund Air Asia!",,,,,
  Flight was scheduled to depart at 7.05pm and was retimed to 7.30pm. Then it was retimed to 8.10pm 3. It is currently 8.05pm and we have been told that it's now retimed to 9pm. Very well timed as this does not place them liable for any damages.,,,,,
"  My original flight was moved to a time I couldn't get there. The flight change notification promised a refund or a flight change. I needed to change my flight to a different airport so the agent told me I would need to just book a new flight and they would issue a refund for the original flight. I went ahead and booked the new flight, but never received the refund. I have tried everything I could and this company refuses to speak with me about the issue. I've tried submitting new tickets and cases since I can't get an agent to speak with me and they decline to refund, saying the flight wasn't canceled so it's not eligible for a refund. I have sent screen shots of the e-mail where the refund was promised and they are just ignoring me completely. ",,,,,
" Avoid Air Asia at all cost. They cancelled our tickets MNL-DPS-MNL, with less than a month's notice. No other flights to or from Denpasar were available - seems to me like they have stopped flying this route. Obviously, we then had to pay twice as much to repurchase tickets so close to the departure date, and so far, 3 weeks later, we have seen no sign of an Air Asia reimbursement. This company, it turns out, is in significant financial distress (PN17 status in Malaysia), so this must be a symptom of that. Don't risk losing your money with them - Air Asia seems to have gone from hero to zero, unfortunately.",,,,,
"  I flew with AirAsia twice this month, 1st from Penang to Langkawi, and then from Langkawi to Kuala Lampur, and both were top quality flights. The 1st flight arrived at the destination even earlier than the stated time, and the 2nd one was punctual as well, their cabin crew are all professional, well dressed, respectful and beautiful too! unlike Malaysian Airlines staff which were disrespectful and not good looking, If you're looking for domestic flights within Malaysia, they're the best option to choose imo, don't let the negative reviews scare you away, I bought one 25kg luggage and when I weighed it at the airport, it was 2 kg above that but still they said it was fine and didn't charge anything extra for it.",,,,,
"  Received a message 2 hours prior to departure that flight will be delayed by 40 min. Just at the moment boarding started, it was announced that the gate has changed. After another her 1h of wait in a cramped non ac waiting area, boarding finally started. Another 30 min wait, the plane finally took off with a 2h 10 min delay. The explanation was heavy air traffic over Kuala Lumpur, which wasn’t true, since other flight were not delayed. Flight itself uneventful",,,,,
"  Good airline, faster checkin. Less Queues. Only issue was lack of info on terminals in JKT. On time service from Jakarta to Bali. Baggage collection was fast",,,,,
" This is such a convenient flight from Chiang Mai to Hua Hin, as it eliminates the +/- 3.5-hour transfer from Bangkok to Hua Hin or +/- 3-hour transfer to Cha Am. Pity, it's only 2/3 times a week, usually on Wednesdays and Sundays. The aircraft, staff and service are what you would expect from any AirAsia flight. Efficient and cost-effective. No frills to the extreme - but worth every penny.",,,,,
"  All went quickly and even before time! We were almost late checking our bag, they packed the plane and we landed ahead of time. Cannot complain because it is rare that airlines run their operations ahead of time. No service but we knew about it so no complaints. Point A to point B, all went well. The pilot was very nice informing us when Kota Kinabalu will pop on the horizon, so we were ready and got some great photos of the beautiful mountain. Weather cooperated as well. Thank you and we will fly with you again.",,,,,
" First, when trying to manage our booking, it didn't accept our booking ref.no., but it accepted the e-ticket number. Our flight is from Phnom Penh to Colombo via Kuala Lumpur (self check-in in KL). It only gave me itinerary for the flight from Phnom Penh to Kuala Lumpur and only for one traveler, altough there are two of us. While trying to manage our booking, the booking confirmation was sent to a weird and suspicious e-mail and my contact number was removed and changed into a Chinese phone number. After I changed this strange e-mail to my e-mail address, I received the booking confirmation in Chinese only. All this made us very suspicious and we tried to contact AirAsia office with a number from their website. However, the phone operator informed me that this number doesn't exist. We are now not sure what to do.",,,,,
  Terrible airline. No flexibility and really poor customer service. Flight was delayed 2 hours due to operational circumstances. Missed our check in at our hotel which I made them aware of and didn’t bother putting us in a hotel. ,,,,,
"  Smooth experience from check-in until arrival at the destination. The flight are on time and proper boarding announcements and arrangements. The are no IFE but we can connect to wifi for entertainment - the wifi connection was pretty bad. Food was modest. Smooth take-off and landing. Kudos to the flight crew. Overall, very moderate experience with this airline.",,,,,
  Delayed for more than 2 hours. The boarding experience was a nightmare. Delay announcement via sms and flight announcement display. My in-flight experience are the same as my previous flight - very moderate. ,,,,,
"  The flight and check in was as expected, dull, nothing flash, adequate attention from check in staff and flight staff. But  I paid a small amount for the flight, so you pay for what you get. However the customer communication was awful, non existent in real terms. I needed to communicate with airasia about an amount they overcharged me. Their website and Airasia super app will only allow you to navigate a set list of questions and set answers. If your issue is outside those parameters, they are not interested. Their website and super app contains no email address or phone number to contact them about any issue out side the answers in the website. You keep getting directed to a ""bot"" called Ava. I managed to find on the internet 2 email addresses belonging to airasia. The response from both of them was ""not our dept, Ticket closed"". When asked which dept I should email, no reply. This issue has been going on 6 months now, it is not resolved. It is very clear that airasia wants nothing to do with ""actual customers"", I cannot comprehend how a company can still exist providing this non existent customer interaction and non existent customer servicing.",,,,,
" If you want endless frustration dealing with an AI instead of real customer service, then this might be the place for you. It is almost as if this company intentionally tries to make it difficult so they don’t have to help you.",,,,,
 Flight cancelled by airline shortly before flight but refund not received. Calling or chatting to human is impossible and AI bot gives irrelevant answers but doesn't solve your issue. Then after that says my details can not be verified or time limit is up so cut you off repeatedly even if you try different ways to refer.,,,,,
  Terrible airline. The outbound flight is delayed 3 hours. For the return flight they rescheduled it really early in the morning. We got to the airport then we had a msg that it has been put back to the original time. Missed out on my  hotel breakfast to waste 4 additional hours sitting round at the filthy airport.,,,,,
" Warning: AirAsia booking policies are deceptive! You can search for the best ticket price for a route and think that AirAsia is the lowest, but one page before you pay, AirAsia adds a significant ""processing fee"" without warning such that you cannot compare AirAsia's ticket price to another airline! The only way to check for the accurate ticket price is to go all the way through the booking process and almost purchase the ticket. This is unfair and deceptive! Stay vigilant!",,,,,
"  At every turn AirAsia try to scalp you for every dollar. Examples such as hoping you forget to check-in online so they can charge you additionally, purposefully allocating seat locations (if purchasing more than one ticket) in different positions on-board so that you're more likely to pay the 600THB (per person) to change seats and waiting to tell you last minute your meal option has been discontinued so you have to pay more to get a different meal. We expect more as consumers and preying on the technologically vulnerable is shameful behaviour.",,,,,
"  I book premium flatbed to and from KUL-Taipei, I spent over RM8000 for my wife and my tickets. We leave KUL on Christmas eve. The flight have been delayed first from 10 am to 1:30 and the gate was changed from one site of the large airport to the other side of the airport, we are asked to checked in but was usher to another room for more waiting. The flight finally left around 2:30-3:00 Pm for Taipei. At least we still have the flatbed seat we book to relax on the flight. Later on the return trip, the flight was delayed, and during checked in I realised the seat number are not consistent with my booking, so i asked the ground crew about it and was told not to worry as i still have my seat I booked .. it is a lie. We were shocked when we walk into the cabin as the configuration of the plane is different from our booking. there are no flatbed on this plane, up until now, no one have the decency to let me know about this changes. Later during the flight I asked one of the stewardess how to request for a refund for my premium flatbed booking and was told i need to make an online feedback on their website. I make the feedback after on the 3rd day after returning to KL and I didn't receive any email or message reply. last i check i have a RM400+ credit in my account which i assume is from that flight but i am not sure as i never received any response. This is a lousy way to treat your customer. I make a vow to myself not to ever fly AirAsia again. ",,,,,
"  We had booked our return ticket from Bali to Delhi via Kuala Lumpur at 1.30 pm on Jan 8th 2023. We get a sms which states the flight is preponed to 7am reason not known. Our flight to India is scheduled at 7pm, no other flight before that. We are forced to stay in Kuala Lumpur airport till 7pm.

"  I am on a trip with family of 4 on a leisure trip. We bought a ticket on 6pm flying from Tawau to Kuala Lumpur. But was informed about the flight change to 8:40pm after few days prior to departing. To make matter worse, the flight further delay to 9:25pm after we checked in on departure date. Bad experience of this airline, avoid at all costs if you can. ",,,,,
" First Of all, their website and app are trash. then, there is their scammy add-on system where initially they suggest adding premium flex but without allowing change in baggage weight. Later if I want to add luggage I have to pay exorbitant fees. Next, their flights are never on time and are frequently rescheduled. The staff are unprofessional and uncouth. Even the flight's interior is not clean! They make false claims of allowing free rescheduling but add multiple fees which makes rescheduling ridiculously expensive. Please for the love of god, never get on these flights.",,,,,
 ZERO OUT OF 100. Worst airline I have ever flown. Nothing on time. Nothing organized. Was selectively pulled out to have bags weighed and charged more. Extra 900 pesos for a carry on that weighed 8kg. Flight was delayed at every stop. Didn't arrive to catch our transport in Puerto Princesa on time. Then again leaving the flight was delayed an hour. Still sitting here as a matter of fact. Philippines Airlines and Cebu Pacific both moving smooth on either side of us.,,,,,
"  We had booked a flight (AK882) from Kuala Lumpur on 11.30am on 12/24/2022 to Bangkok. This flight was booked six months ago so that we can leave for Thailand after staying two days in KL. On 12/21/2022, we were notified by AirAsia via email that our flight (AK882) was cancelled due to aircraft downsize and we were re-scheduled to leave KL at 6.50am the next day (12/25/2022). Out of curiosity, we did an online search and we saw AirAsia still have other flights available from KL to Bangkok on 12/24/2022, but with higher ticket price, so we contact AirAsia support via chat and tell them that we have to be in Bangkok on 12/24 for our vacation activities and hoped they could re-schedule us to the same day flights. To our surprise, the support staff were not helpful at all by keeping on saying ""no, we don't have any seat available for flights on 12/24"". We ended up rebooking our flight with Malaysia Airlines to fly to Bangkok on 12/24. We are still awaiting the refunds for the canceled flight from AirAsia. ",,,,,
"  My worst flight experience ever. I travelled with my friends and I wasn't checked in, whereas my friends were. On being asked why, the guy at the counter said that the plane was downsized and there were no more seats! Just think of that! My ticket was already booked and confirmed way back in October. We wasted more than one hour trying to convince the guy to give me a ticket but to no avail. Finally after giving the an ultimatum, he finally checked me in, and can you believe it, there were 7 unoccupied seats on the plane. I'll never recommend Air Asia.",,,,,
" AirAsia cancelled / postponed my flight and allowed for one time change of schedule for free and this is all done through their chatbot called AVA. however, I made a mistake by choosing wrong departure date, this isn't fixable by their chatbot, but I found a way to actually get in touch with real human customer service through the chat service. Had to wait for an hour of 200 people queuing, when it finally my chance, I wrote my inquiries and they just disconnected without answer. It happened TWICE. Like what other reviewers said, be careful with customer service of this airline, as it is basically non existent. Not reachable by phone either. They will either let you speak with a chatbot or refer you to a human agent that just don't care and disconnect you at will.",,,,,
" Check in was easy, both flights were on time and luggage arrived without incident. That was the best of it. Every announcement was screamed at us in multiple languages. They woke the whole plane up with 2.5hrs to go (scheduled landing at 0330hrs) so they could serve breakfast to about three passengers. You can't bring water on board, and you pay for it on the plane. The passengers were generally pushy and rude. KLIA is a filthy dump and we will avoid flying Air Asia again to ensure we don't have to transit there in future.",,,,,
"  I was notified that my flight was cancelled, so I requested a refund. Today at the airport I saw the flight I had booked flew today. Asking for answers from AirAsia they tried to blame me “just to clarify, you are asking for a refund for the missed flight?” ",,,,,
"  Be careful on the Air Asia site as you think you are booking through Air Asia and then suddenly you are booking the flights you selected through kiwi.com - but it still looks like Air Asia! My flights were rescheduled to the next day but I was not notified. I turned up at the airport to find out my flight wouldn’t be until the next day. Air Asia blamed kiwi.com and kiwi.com blamed Air Asia. I was not offered any compensation for the lost accommodation fees or expensive Uber to the airport, nothing. Neither Air Asia or kiwi.com would accept any responsibility. I hate to think what would’ve happened if I had a connecting flight. Do not book through Air Asia or kiwi.com, it’s not worth the trouble.",,,,,
"  It's so nice to welcome back AirAsia after almost a 2 years absence since the start of the pandemic. After having had a few bad experience with Malaysia airlines quite recently. I chose Air Asia for the value of money. On Christmas day, flight was on time. Check in at the airport was orderly, premium flex customers perks and priority were observed. Boarding by the zone was very orderly also. Plane is clean and crew were lovely and welcoming. It really pays to get the exit row for the extra leg room and comfort. My pre-ordered meal of Bukhara chicken rice was delicious ad spicy, and it came with a small bottle of water. I was impressed at how efficient the crew worked, and they kept the 2 toilets clean at regular intervals as well. Landing was so smooth too. Luggage delivered in a timely manner and in good condition. For someone who is used to flying premium airlines in business class, I must say this was a very inoressive experience. I think in future for medium to short haul flights, I really don't mind to fly with them and save some money as well. Maybe party is also because, nowadays, many premium airlines cut costs so much that, more and more, they resemble budget airlines, except for the price tag.",,,,,
"  Online system allowed to buy hot seats but after boarded the plane, my wife and my son were asked to give up our hot seats for normal ones because my teenage son is below the age requirement. Manage to navigate a way to submit a case to the airline via the app. Within a week, the case was closed just like that.  Worst customer service.",,,,,
"  I like Air Asia for been a good low cost airlines. But when you have an issue, the problem are starting and you will find nobody at the end for a solution or at least an answer. Air Asia changed the flight schedule by 5 hours and this was not compatible with my holidays. So I asked for a refund on Dec 2. On Dec 16, I went through the long and inefficient talk with robot AVA until I get in the queue for a human agent with n°90. After an hour, I got an answer: your refund will be done in 2 days. On Dec 20, after playing again with AVA for half an hour, I was granted to the queue with number 144. And after 2 questions, the chat was terminated by the agent or ? and I still not get and answer. But every time the claim case was solved. I guess this is a great satisfaction for Air Asia to close claims, without answering their customer. In fact AVA was better than the agent, but both are inefficient. So I gave up with AVA, and called the phone voicemail service for Air Asia Thailand. I explained my case and  after 24 hours still waiting for a call back when it should have been done in 24 hours. But for urgent case I can contact AVA: joke. Form this experience, I notice that the customer service at Air Asia is non-existent, but also when you consider the price of the ticket (must check everything: seat, luggage, food), Air Asia is no more advantageous compare to a normal airlines like Malaysia Airlines or Thai. And for a small difference of the fare you can talk to a real agent instead of a stupid robot and incompetent agents. For the future I will be careful before booking at AirAsia, since this company reschedule and cancel flights many times since the start of COVID and the new normal.",,,,,
"  Miserable to non existent customer service, every single flight is delayed and no prior notice or updates are given. For the latest flight we were ushered into the gate area with no restrooms, no seating and no update given about the delay, there wasn’t even a person at the counter until well after the departure time. Easily the worst of budget airlines, please take your money elsewhere.",,,,,
  8 hr delay on flight take off. Land in Melbourne 3.5 hr wait for baggage. Need I say more. I have a nap sack I put under the seat and a carry on bag. AirAsia would not let me take my small bag on. So it got checked. And now the delays. And also last flight broken luggage. Avoid this airline.,,,,,
"  The flight from Kuala Lumpur 18:20 was first delayed and then canceled and moved to 3:30. At least 8 hours later. The explanation was bad weather. There was rain and also i heart thunder. But in the 8 hours we waited and had to sleep at the airport other airplanes flew. So it felt like there must be another option then to let us wait so long at mid night at an AirPort. We also had to beg for some food and drinks, which we eventually got, but it was not offered from first hand. Also no hotel was offered.",,,,,
"  Although having checked in online, for the baggage drop off you are being referred to kiosk / machine to print your own luggage tag, however most of these kiosks are out of order or suddenly run into an error while processing your request. After addressing this to the staff, you're just referred back to the kiosk and after insisting it won't work, finally being referred to a counter to drop off your luggage. At waiting your turn at the counter, the completely uninterested ground staff member simple wanted to refer me back to the kiosk again even after i've stated it didn't work. When i insisted she mentioned her counter was for checking inn cabin crew only, it was clearly she was lying as other passengers were checked by her before. In the end i got another staff member involved who told the lady behind the counter to actually assist me, after which my bag was checked in smoothly within 3 minutes. in the meantime many agitated passengers encountered the same frustrating experience! I truly don't understand why an airline would tolerate such rude and indifferent behavior. I've filled a complaint with AirAsia about this, but i only received an automated answer and the day after an email saying my case was closed (with no information given or anything). Flying with AirAsia? Never again for me.",,,,,
  We arrived 1.5 hours before our flight. Most of the kiosks were broken and we were sent to 4 different counters by the Air Asia staff.  After we finally made it to the front of the line to drop off our bags they refused to take our bags telling us we were too late. The lady at counter V16 was extremely rude and began criticizing me for not hearing her over the speaker system about the last call for dropping off our bags. I explained to her that we did not hear her because we were being shuffled around by their staff from counter to counter. She replied by telling me that she didn’t believe that I didn’t hear her and continued to criticize me further. She took zero accountability for their incompetent staff. We ended up missing our flight and had to rebook another flight. Later I returned to her counter to get her name so I could file a report but the staff acted dumb and told me they didn’t know her name. I then asked to speak to a supervisor and was told it was his day off?! None of the staff members wear name tags. We will never travel AirAsia again!,,,,,
"  I booked return flights Bandung - Singapore on 5th September 2022. I subsequently received an email from AirAsia on 15 October telling me that my flights were cancelled due to 'Operational reasons'. A promise is made for the refund to be made in 30 days. Now more than a month later, the refund is still in progress and no further advisories to enlighten me the status .... except from what I see in my account on their website. AirAsia has no customer service, no customer service phone number, not even an email address. All they have is an online chatbot named AVA, which is worse than useless. So you are on your own should any problems arise after you confirm your booking. Will definitely avoid flying AirAsia if I had a choice.",,,,,
  The worst airline I have ever dealt with. They would not allow me to book a pre-flight bag and then charged me $80 for a bag that was slightly overweight (10 kilos). I had no choice but to pay as I was on the way to the flight. They were totally disinterested in helping. Terrible experience all around.,,,,,
"  When the return flight was changed to another time, I had the option to change the date/flight to a new one. And I tried to do this, in the process to change it seems it doesn’t work and I get no confirmation email of the change. But so I find out they make up a new email which I have to register with on airasia website or some bullshit! So the ticket was changed and when it was time to check in for this flight, I also didn’t see any email to my own email and I lost my flight. Customer service is only a robot, and no phone number to customers support picks up the phone.",,,,,
" The worst flight! Of course was delayed! There was an accident with one of the passengers, help was provided late and because AirAsia are not providing stickers with the passenger details to the bags etc.. it took another 30-40 mins to find the bag of the passenger that was removed from the flight. Everyone was shocked and panicked, when I requested water after an accident it wasn’t provided, you have to buy it! Just ridiculous! Flight was 3 hours + and with all the delays we were in the airplane for more than 4-5 hours! Customer service is as low as it could be. Not talking about how uncomfortable and tight the seats was.",,,,,
"  According their check in process, they mentioned we able start online check 14 days before departure. However, in reality is 10 days before. They should make the correction. Flight return from Krabi to Kuala Lumpur, most of the inflight meal was sold out. Cabin crew mentioned only left “ Nasi Lemak option”. When they make this announcement flight already on sky of Selangor. I don’t know what the purpose they make announcement of food sold out when the flight prepare for landing. They should bring more food since they notice no restaurant operate in international terminal. A320 Neo seat is suck. Not comfortable.",,,,,
" Nice, uneventful short flight, clean aircraft, super nice crew. Left on time, arrived on time. Only ""negative""? Parked a bit far away from arrival at DMK.",,,,,
" Never again with AirAsia. I wish I could have given it 0 stars. This is coming from a loyal customer during pre-pandemic days. This airline unfortunately never recovered from the pandemic. Both sectors (inbound and outbound flights) were delayed by more than 1.5 hours. Finally landed in the domestic terminal and was ushered by a bus to go to international, before walking all the way to immigration, and then had to wait for luggage. Absolutely horrible and ruined my day/week.",,,,,
"  My wife has problems with her knees and has great difficulty with stairs so we notified the person at the counter, they asked can she do stairs, I said no she can not. They said ok and charged us for wheelchair. Then she had a wheelchair brought and said I was to push it. I declined and she sent for someone. We had a layover in Kuala Lumpur and when it was time to board no wheelchair, and a long ramp and then she had to climb stairs anyway. When we arrived in Danang again no wheelchair. And nowhere to contact customer service to get our money back. Never again.",,,,,
"  My flight was suppose to be at 4.35 pm on 31/10/22. The flight got delayed to 5.50 pm. So I waited. After half an hour the flight got delayed another time to 6.40 pm. Isn't this ridiculous? We need to be there 2 hours before departure and the flight is delayed than 2 hours. I for one did not have enough currency to buy any food  and I was like super hungry.. by the time I reached KL I was starving.  This was a very bad experience for me. The cabin crew was so unfriendly, never even greet the customers when they enter, busy talking to themselves.",,,,,
"  First of all I understand that AirAsia is a low fare airline but doesn’t mean that whatever that this airline management’s doing is right where I flew in this airline so many times and never flew on the time of they advertised initially when purchasing the ticket. We purchase the tickets suits our occasions but what happen always are rescheduling the flight, over delay and frequently change gates. Due to delay and rescheduling, I can’t attend my event. At least for not disappointing please provide some complimentary drinks for making your customers to wait for so long. Please be responsible on the schedule that advertising initially. After all this is low fare airline not free airline so please respect your customer’s time since we are purchasing tickets too. This is not fair at all where if we as a customer if late for few minutes, will the airline wait for us, no right, so again I’m telling that please respect your customer’s time.",,,,,
"  AirAsia has no proper customer support and not able to reach customer care. They have bot AVA with limited options that can't resolve your issues. Due to cheap quality website, I got duplicate ticket for same flight on same date. I raised a ticket and try to follow up with airasia.com in many ways but no luck.",,,,,
"  Booking for onward flights were correct, there was enough time to connect in Manila. Then the airline issued a ticket under i0ne booking number and mention connection guaranteed by carrier. Booking for return flight did not alert on any issue for connection. The connecting tine (1 hour and 20 minutes) was too short for immigration formalities and taxi to next place for connecting flight. I tried to reach customer service. After hours waiting for agent i got a brief message: the company had issued 2 booking codes (one for each segment of the itinerary) so it could not guarantee the connection. I had to buy another ticket for the connecting flight, 3 hours later, to be sure I would have time to go through immigration and to take a taxi to go to departure place for connecting flight. AirAsia should not show connecting flights with too short time to connect. It should show flights with at least 3 hours for connection, or it should inform client, when booking a Bangkok to Cebu flight that client will need at least 3 hours for immigration plus transport to second place for connecting flight. It is unfair to let client book and pay flight with insufficient connecting time and then tell client ""Sorry there is nothing we can do, yes you are likely to miss the connecting flight, you should buy a new ticket for a later flight"". ",,,,,
  Absolutely the worst customer service. Can't ever talk to a real person. Tried to cancel due to a medical issue with relative. Did not want a refund but merely a credit towards a future flight when illness over but refused through their automated chat. Again no live person capabilities. The worst airline service experience ever. I would never do business with them again. I'll pay more elsewhere. Beware!,,,,,
"  The system auto assigned my 8 yr old daughter to a seat 12 rows from me, which is against the airline's safety policy. When I contacted Customer service to raise my concern, they agreed to move her to a seat close by. But then at airport check in, I couldn't print boarding pass. Was told to go to payment counter and pay for changing my daughter's seat! After escalation, the manager even accused me of putting my daughter in a far away seat but now wants to move her closer, hence I should pay. I find her accusation so ridiculous. She finally agreed to waive seat charge, as though she did me a favor. I wonder why AirAsia system would assign young kids to sit by themselves.  My advise. Go with another airline!",,,,,
"  I booked on the airasia.com powered by kiwi.com website and found out today my flight has been moved 6.5hrs earlier to a time I simply cannot make (and makes the journey from Siem Reap to Singapore 13 hours long!). I am now being told I get no refund if I don't fly on it because it would be a 'voluntary' cancellation, and it will cost over $320 dollars more to rebook to a later flight on the same day. I thought maybe after covid the terrible travel services would cease, but I guess Air Asia does not care. Shocking treatment.",,,,,
" Had a flight from Bangkok to Osaka cancelled during COVID. They gave a partial refund but the rest remained as a voucher.  However, using the voucher is next to impossible. In March I wanted to go to Krabi but the voucher didn't work. I contacted the airline and explained the problem but they were so slow in responding that I ran out of time and had to book flights at a higher price and without the discount vouchers. When they finally got back to me they asked for my information and then I never heard from them again and they closed the enquiry without informing me. I'm trying to use the vouchers for another trip. I'm about a week away from when I need to fly and I still haven't been able to book flights because their customer service is so awful. I contacted them months ago via email (after they hung up on me on the phone twice!) and they asked me for my information again. They have so far confirmed that I have vouchers but haven't given me any way to use them either during booking or after booking. Once again I've waited so long that the flights I wanted have disappeared and I'll now be paying a higher price for flights I didn't want. The only way to contact them now is though their terrible online chat which never understands my question. I've managed to get in an online queue but I'm number 99 and have moved one place in about 30 minutes. ",,,,,
"  I booked this flight on August and AirAsia cancelled it so I had to reschedule. Then when finally came the travel time and I arrived at 7am at the Jakarta station, they told me that the flight to Medan has been rescheduled again this morning for 6pm so around 9 hours later. This was already bad because I booked a trip in Medan so I couldn't make it on time. And I didn't even receive any email or notification about rescheduling. Then around 3pm I got another email saying that the flight has been rescheduled for 1am of the next day. 5 min later I got another message saying the flight has been rescheduled for 1:50am. So 4 times rescheduled, together 16 hours of delay. They gave us ridiculously low amount of money as an excuse. When I started to think about a refund and I tried to book another flight at the same day with another company, AirAsia said that I won't get any refund because I rejected it. Which I did not, they told me about the refund and I said that I have to think about it. ",,,,,
"  My Bangkok to Phnom Penh flight in October 2022 was rescheduled and I received an email notification of the change of flight time. There was a 7.5-hour change of time, so I decided to cancel my ticket and receive a refund. I couldn't see any option to contact a member of staff, other than a bot on the AirAsia website. Since submitting my claim, I haven't received any correspondence from AirAsia. Luckily, it was a really cheap flight and I can take the loss. I certainly wouldn't book with AsiaAir again because I just wouldn't want to be placed in a similar situation. ",,,,,
"  Flight was cancelled more than 2 weeks prior to departure for ""Operational reasons"". Attempted to secure a refund but it took over 2 weeks just to get a response. AirAsia, decided that, rather than a 5 hour transit, an alternative flight a day later with around 15 hours of travel was a sufficient substitute. Over 3 weeks later and I am still waiting to understand if I will receive a refund. Will never book with AirAsia again.",,,,,
" Worst flight experience ever. Had double booked due to system error. Filed in a refund request for one ticket to AirAsia but seems they don't want to give my money back. The process took so long and no customer service available anywhere to give your complaint directly. D-1 before my scheduled flight, my morning flight got rescheduled to the afternoon without other option available to refund or even reschedule my flight. The system in the check-in terminal is slow. I think the company is facing bankruptcy.",,,,,
"  Had a flight 2.9.22 18:55 to Kuala Lumpur - I'm there an hour early - sitting at my Gate 6a it says very clearly 18:55 DPS-KUL AirAsia at the Gate. I go to board they tell me my flight its the other flight at 18:55 AirAsia to Kuala Lumpur at Gate 2 but it’s already left. I go to the other gate explain, they say it’s my fault because I didn’t go to the live checkin. And had I done the online checkin properly I would have seen. This is the text on the online ticket: ""you may proceed directly to the gate using this e-boarding pass"". The employee said there were tickets available the same day, but until I admitted it was my fault he would not give me one for today but instead for tomorrow.  I have never ever experienced anything close to this. In the end luckily I managed to get a ticket for the same day but had to pay the difference.",,,,,
"  I went to my gate entrance for my domestic flight at 2.15 when my flight is at 2.50. At the time, when the officer scanned my boarding pass the machine said ""not checked in"" even thought I clearly had the boarding pass. The officer said to try again in 5 minutes and the same result kept coming up until 15 minutes had passed and now the result became ""too late to board"". The officer told me to go to the service counter and they kept sending me to different service counters until I reached the rudest lady who initially told me that I can't board within 20 minutes of take off, even though I was at the gate 35 minutes before take off. I kept begging her to help me but all she said was ""please step aside, sir. I'm busy"". That was 5 minutes prior to the supposed take off and of course I missed the flight. After all of this I had to go retrieve the bags I checked in and that took over 20 minutes, at which time I found out the flight had been delayed by 40 minutes. I have to wait for the delayed flight to depart before I can take back my checked in bags. What kind of customer service is this? Also I was informed that they may help me with rescheduling the flight if I pay the difference even though 1 AirAsia employee told me it was the system's fault.",,,,,
"  Both flights from Jakarta to Penang back to Jakarta had three delays, and they canceled two of our flights, then delayed the final return flight to a 1:40 am departure. It caused us three extra hotel night expenses for a 2.5 hour flight. Horrible communication. We were not even informed of the delay.",,,,,
"  I submitted an app check in and it was successfully submitted. I had no check in baggage so I only went to the airport 50min before the flight to print my boarding pass and board the plane. But when i went to the airport it was not reflected on the system and they said I was not checked in and as such cannot check in anymore as counter is closed. The only solution was to buy a new air ticket. And I was not given a choice of seats and was asked to purchase what i later found out to be the most expensive seat on the plane, a hot seat, which I did not ask for. A simple trip air ticket cost doubled and totally ruined my trip. ",,,,,
"  Good value for money, uneventful short hop from JKT to KUL, early morning. Good value for money regarding pre-ordered meal, easy check-in and clean airplane. Nice crew.",,,,,
  I was weary of this airline because of my previous experience flying in from Manila last July 2022. However ground crew Cheska changed it all. She managed to make our check in from Dumaguete to Manila quick and efficient. Her loyalty and hard work deserves recognition.,,,,,
"  Return flights for August 2022, both changed to one that didn't work for me at all. Reason given was that getting me safely to my destination was their highest priority. Rejected the new flights and requested refund via their AVA bot. 3 days later, sent me email confirming the replacement flight booking that i had rejected. No way to contact other than ava bot. Messed up my travel plans and now adding to my problems.",,,,,
"  Tried to book a flight through their website. They process my credit card then the next day sent an email stating unsuccessful in the process. But credit card transaction went through. Now to get funds back, it will take 14 to 30 days. The worst customer service I have ever deal with. No support, no phone number or live person to talk with. ",,,,,
"  Flight was cancelled and retimed multiple times to exceedingly inconvenient timing. It is never okay to retime flights to another time because if it was, then I would have bought the ticket at that time and not the one that I choose. Airasia has no customer service whatsoever. A useless robot is not customer service. Airasia also practices Excessively draconian rules on baggage weight as if an extra 1kg of carry on baggage. Charges customers exorbitantly for baggage, food or any service under the guise of ‘low cost’. ",,,,,
" AA has gone from bad to worse, if that is possible! Tried to change flights due to a visa issue but the only form of interaction is with AVA - an auto-bot with limited information. I have been trying to reschedule for over 2 hours now without any success. This is tantamount to fraud and scam - AirAsia is essentially robbing us of our money. I will never book through AirAsia again. If the airline is unable to provide an adequate customer service, the whole outfit should just close shop or sell to a party better able to run the airline. What a waste of money!",,,,,
"  I ordered my round-way tickets months in advance, only for them to say my return flight will be canceled one week before the actual flight. I needed to talk to someone to get more detail about the process, but no human is available as their system is now only a bot.  The system offered to move my return flight to another day but none of the proposed timing fit my schedule, so I asked for a refund. I was given a pending case confirmation, without any detail whatsoever on the refund processing.  Since I couldn’t get any clarity, I decided to go down to the airport counter and asked some questions to the ground staff at the AirAsia counter.  She checked and confirmed the refund request was actually for both depart and return tickets, something that is not made clear in the bot chat. The ground staff could not void my refund request as this has to be done by AirAsia and not the airport staff. I had thought that the refund was only going to be for my return ticket but I had lost both tickets. Because of this, they couldn’t guarantee that I will still have my name in the booking system on my departure date. The ground staff said there’s nothing that can be done on their side as they have no way to reach AirAsia. Basically, I need to book another ticket which is way more expensive now that I have so little time left before my flight. So before you book your tickets think twice. It could just be a stroke of bad luck on my side, but I’m reading so many reviews that are similar to mine and they help solidify why I will never book from this airline ever again.",,,,,
"  Worst experience ever with an airline when It comes to hassles and changes. Flights from KL to Langkawi delayed. I received an email whilst at the airport getting ready to check in saying delayed. My original return flight from Langkawi to KL was cancel and we were bumped back over 2 hrs to a later flight. Then that flight was delayed after we checked in. Then to add insult to injury, the Air Asia flight going to KL that was scheduled for a later departure ended up flying out before my earlier flight. Then if you try to lodge a complaint about the service it is all virtual response now. Seriously such lousy service and terrible airline. I truly regret booking with Air Asia. Next time I will look for any other airline before I ever book with Air Asia again.",,,,,
"   I bought a ticket through AirAsia website for a flight on the 21st of August (Sunday), from Chiang Mai to Kuala Lumpur. I received an email last Saturday, notifying me that the flight had been canceled due to ""operational reasons"". I tried to understand what these reasons were but I could only contact an automated bot. I eventually got to talk with a so-called live agent (had to wait in queue for 3 hours) that pretended he was typing (the 3 dots pre-message symbol showed up for like 5 minutes) and eventually the conversation ""expired"". I came to understand that the flight they sold me (AK 857) doesn't operate on Sundays. I have another ticket bought from them, for the 25th August (Thursday), from KL to Krabi (AK 868) and I already checked Flightaware and found out that the flight only operates on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. I asked for a refund for the flight that got cancelled by AirAsia, but so far I haven't got my money back and from the looks of it, I'm understanding that the same situation will arise with the KL to Krabi flight. Don't trust AirAsia flights and always check on several sites if the flights actually exist and operate on the days they are selling them.",,,,,
"  Worst experience ever. Will never fly again. All they want is to find a way to charge you extra. Seats are cramped, unprofessional behaviour of the staff, late check in and late arrival, and overall a horrible travel experience. I have flown enough low cost airlines in the world, I would rate Air Asia as the worst ever.",,,,,
"  During the flight the food service was suspended right in front of me due to turbulence. Then they resumed it from the back of the cabin, but never came to me. When I called a flight attendant and asked for a meal, she told me that they have run out of it and added ""I'm very sorry"". Didn't offer even a glass of water. Throughout the whole 2 hr flight I was hungry and mad. I'll never fly AirAsia again.",,,,,

Checked my email the next day before my flight, didn’t receive any email confirmation that my additional 10 kg baggage purchase has been approved. I decided to only bring one check in luggage weight only 19 kg When I checked in in jakarta airport, i was forced to pay Rp. 223,009 for additional 10 kg baggage which transaction wasn’t successful or been confirmed. Tried to ask for my refund from AirAsia customer service at Denpasar airport was told to go through AVA which were very helpful airasia customer service hosted by AI, after waiting waiting for more than an hour, my queue was terminated,  Without email confirmation whether the transaction was successful, they just forced me to pay something you didn’t purchase?",,,,,
 Bangalore to Mumbai. Worst ever experience. No professionalism. Postponing flights and after that also nothing on time. I would never again go by this flight. Why do they write even for departure when they are never going to follow it. So much inconvenience.,,,,,
"  I will never take AirAsia again if there is a choice. Worst ever airlines I have ever experienced. They rescheduled my flight and changed me and my kids' seating from first row (hot seat) to a normal seat in the back row. And there is no refund for this change. I tried to chat in Airasia App multiple times but the only response I got was 'we are experiencing technical issue, please try again later.' It is really frustrating when the planned schedule was simply changed by AirAsia and the seat row (I bought first seat for the comfort of me and my kids as I was travelling without husband) was changed to normal seat. And is there is no refund for this row change.",,,,,
"  Would like to give big thumbs up to boarding crew Ms Noor at Tiruchirappalli Airport. We are four family, flying from Trichy(India) to Singapore).

  My mother travelled alone in Air Asia on 07 June 2023. The flight was very comfortable. Services were good. Ground staff was extremely helpful. Sincere thanks to the ticketing staff.,,,,,
  I will like to thank entire staff of Air Asia. We were on family vacation with my 2.6 year old child and got amazing cooperation. Without any hassle we could book seats and the entire journey was enjoyable. Will like to be thankful to the pilots as the landing on all the flights was smooth. I paid my gratitude to the staff personally too.,,,,,

"  I was supposed to be travelling from Bangalore to kochi on the AirAsia flight on March 23. We reached the Airport on time but because they didn't mention that the flight is in the newly launched terminal. We were late to reach the boarding gate but even though there was still time to board the flight, the crew didn't allow to board the flight. We knew this because when we where waiting to leave from the second terminal 15 minutes after not allowed entry another Airasia crew asked tried to help us to board the same flight 15 minutes after being denied entry. This is completely unacceptable behaviour unexpected from AirAsia India and we will make sure not to choose this flight again in future.",,,,,
 Airline staff helped me with last minute web check in cancellation also helped locating the luggage and provided the best support and service. 5/5 for such hospitality and customer delight,,,,,
"  First time flying with Airasia. Hospitality and customer service was excellent. I arrived late in airport due to my car got an accident and check in gate was closed. However upon requesting airline staff that I have international connection, they allowed and assisted me in getting to the aircraft.

"  I must mention about this this exceptionally great service rendered by AirAsia. I travelled in the Air Asia I5 472 from Goa to Mumbai on 18 December at 1 am. On arriving at Mumbai, my mother realised that she forgot to carry one of her bag from Goa airport to the flight. I can't explain in words how Air Asia has gone out of their way to get my bag from the Lost and Found Department, and send it to Mumbai by the earliest flight all free. The bag reached us in Mumbai safe and sound. I recommend Air Asia services as their way of handling their customers before flying, during the flight, and after flight is too good.",,,,,
"  Airline with most compact seat arrangements. Iwould avoid this but in last moment its fare was cheapest from Delhi to Jaipur. Icing on the cake was I got last row window seat as it was the only row which was Available, fortunately no one was there in the middle seat so little bit of comfort. Departed on time and reached Jaipur before time. Cabin crew looks courteous but as it was early morning 5 am flight so after boarding slept all time so never needed to interact with them. Seats are compact as i said earlier. Overall not a bad experience for less than hour ling flight.",,,,,

  AirAsia India is just pathetic. We were traveling in a group of 6 including an infant and on check-in the executive didn’t even bother to ask us or allocate the seats together as courtesy. All of us got separate seats and it was a nightmare to travel with a baby and no support from my family cause of these seats. Even some exemptions in the baggage allowance was close to nothing. Overall we felt the staff was not cooperative and the rules were way too stringent.,,,,,
"  Worst customer service at Ranchi airport and this is the 3rd time, each time they create a unique bad experience with AirAsia at Ranchi. I saw them charging extra fee luggage, where couples were carrying with 14 kg cabined for checking. When I intervened they came with some random rules. But for sure will ensure I never use their service again",,,,,
"  I booked my Air Asia tickets for 2 Nov around 2 PM flight which got cancelled and rescheduled to different flight at 4.25 PM same day. At morning I received a call that new rescehuled flight delayed by 1 hour. After reaching to airport I again received a message that flight is delayed for 1 hour more and then it got delayed for more finally taking off at 9 PM and landing at 11.15 PM. So my 2.30 hour flight was actually 9 hours long. In airport AirAsia provided lunch which was only 5 spoons of biryani and there was no food provided in flight. Due to this I had to pay for lunch and for dinner and finally taking cab instead of metro. All of this increased my budget. So disappointed with Air Asia, No value of our time, had to pay more and my whole day and plans was compromised. Please avoid taking AirAsia, I with my family had worst experience ever.",,,,,
"  I have booked tickets for 6 people. 4 hours before the flight take off I received a call from AirAsia customer service that the flight is cancelled due to technical issue. I was asked to take the next day 5 am call. I told them I had already started my commute to airport and try to find an alternate flight for the same day. 10 minutes later I got a call again stating that the technical problem got resolved and I can use the same flight. When I enquired with some of the co-passengers to find out whether they received similar call from AirAsia, none of them had received calls like that. ",,,,,
"  Yesterday we travelled from Guwahati to Chennai, unfortunately at the last moment of check in there was a problem for which we were not allowed to check in. Thanks to one of the employee of AirAsia Mr Soni who helped us to check in n get the boarding pass. Thanks to his generous behaviour and helpful nature.",,,,,
"  The seats were comfortable, leather covers on the seats provided premium look and comfort. Leg room was low as per my height (5 10), staff was good and services were also good. Ground staff was helpful. Due to some reason i wasn't able to check in and book my seat, i requested on the counter he allotted me the seat although he requested for a positive feedback to be written. ",,,,,
"  The service of the head Airhostess Ms Kadoyee was very impressive, she was very Humble, understanding to all our grievances and explained in details about the various facilities and services in the flight. It was a great experience flying with AirAsia. Luggage arrangements and boarding was excellent. Personal care with senior citizen was a great sign of humanity and consideration. Thank you",,,,,
"  Terrible experience with check in at Goa airport. I had paid for the much advertised Red Carpet service. There were only 2 counters open and both, (including one which was supposed to be red carpet) were crowded and disorderly. There was no premium feel and I had to go to the ordinary counter for baggage drop. Felt cheated for paying for a service that the airline could not offer and it appeared to be a way of fleecing customers. Check in staff were not sympathetic and did not care. Pathetic service. Will never travel by AirAsia India if there is a choice. To be fair to the airline, the only good experience was the hot and good food served on the flight.",,,,,
  Great fares. Excellent ground staff who calls you to let you know gate is closing. Awesome polite cabin crew. Comfortable seats. Excellent service. Good food.,,,,,
"  The ground staff Ms Piyalis at Kolkata behaviour was excellent. She helped us in completing all the process very fast, she was cooperative and very humble. Thanks to AirAsia for having such a lovely staff.",,,,,
"  From making a reservation first they canceled the morning flight, they shifted the passenger to afternoon flight. Boarding was delayed by 30 min. A small seat if someone is broad and and heavy weight. ",,,,,
"  On this flight as my travel agency had performed a group booking check in online was possible just couple of days before the flight. However when tried to print the baggage tags at the airport kiosks, I was unable to do so. The check in desks helped to drop the bag and I was pleased to note that during the boarding process, the staff was ensuring that people board as per their zones and this also helped prevent overcrowding during boarding. As the flight was a bit on the lighter side, the crew made me sit at an emergency exit row seat free of cost which was really great as the legroom was really good for a 2 hour 20 minute journey. The flight landed also on time and baggage retrieval was also swift. Overall a good flight. Appreciated the gesture of the crew allotting me an exit row seat.",,,,,
"  Vizag to Delhi and my experience was not pleasant. I booked international baggage and additional Baggage along with VIP for all 3 passengers. Other PNR only VIP. When I booked I had questions about baggage allowance showing 45kgs per passengers so called customer service (Twice) for clarification and suggestion for carrying 60kg per passenger. With the answers provided I was convinced and proceeded with the same. When i reached the airport at the check in counter the staff informed me that my luggage is overweight and i need to pay, initially i was trying to explain what's my understanding from customer service rep of airasia, immediately i was cut off by the line manager standing there in suit saying ""how can you believe customer service guys and you must know"". When I responded that i have call records he said ok lets play them now and listen to check in. When i was trying to play the record he again cut me off saying what exactly is my problem as i should be aware of baggage allowance policy and started laughing with his colleague. This was very insulting in front of my family as they felt very embarrassed to be treated like novice flyers. I responded saying I will deal with this later, let me get checked in and paid the extra money and while leaving the line manager along with other staff were murmuring and laughing. Soon one of the staff approached me, looking that we were upset, saying ""sir we will do what we can do to raise a service note of what happened here"" and apologised and left.",,,,,
"  Due to some unexpected scenarios, I came to airport few mins before the flight time and boarding time was supposed to be much before that. I was about to miss my flight but the AirAsia team cooperated a lot and helped me board the flight which was very kind of them. I would be thankful to them. I hope this kind of service continues for all the different airline carriers also.",,,,,
  I’m glad Air Asia allowed my tennis racquets in the checking luggage without extra charges both ways Bangalore - Bhubaneswar. AirAsia’s policy to allow normal size sports equipment without extra charges is highly appreciated. ,,,,,
  Absolutely worse service. No customer care agent available to speak. My flight got cancelled because of some technical reasons by AirAsia India and i will get the refund amount after deducting 1000 rs from the total amount i paid. Regret to choose AirAsia India. Will never choose it again nor will refer it to anyone. ,,,,,
"  I have taken flight with my family from Srinagar to Pune I5 737. Flight details was there will be 35 minutes halt at Delhi airport and Pune passenger will not be allowed to off board. When flight landed at Delhi air hostess announced that Pune passengers need to contact ground staff. We were total 8 Pune passengers which include kid of 2.5 yrs and senior citizens also. Ground staff told us that we have to off board and take another flight of AirAsia which will take off at 22.50 and handed us another ticket. The Srinagar flight landed at 22.20 then they take us from bus to exit and asked us to go from internal transfer with again all handbag checking. At ticket scanning the new tickets which they handed from that 2 tickets were not scanning and throwing some error in their system. So we have to wait there for 10 minute to get the clearance. After that ground staff was asking us to run till gate number 49 to get into another flight. With us as mention having senior citizens and also a kid, literally we had to run with all our hand bags. At gate 49 AirAsia person was saying to us that previous flight do not have that much of capacity. This is the worst management I have seen till now they are not aware about their flight capacity and asking passengers to take another flight in mid of journey. Thank you Air Asia for this pathetic experience and we will not travel with you any more.",,,,,
"  I strongly recommend not to use AirAsia India. I have to raise a very serious concern about baggage. On 21st May we two families landed Srinagar at 1:30 pm, out of our 6 bags 1 bag was missing on the belt, upon asking they said bag was left behind for scanning it will come in next flight, after several follow up they delivered the bag to , me at hotel but the bag lock was tampered, bag got damaged for which I have sent email to nodal officer but the reply I got from them was asking age of the bag, invoice of the bag, that means they can do this by compensating by age of the bag which I have used only 3rd time. ",,,,,
" I booked a flight from Delhi to Bangalore on 1/6/2022. I booked this ticket on 24/05/2022. Since I stay far away from the airport I choose the 9.30am flight. But on 27/05/2022 I got a message from AirAsia stating that they have cancelled my flight and they have re-accommodated me to another flight which is from Delhi to Visakhapatnam and Visakhapatnam to Bangalore but the problem was with the flight timing which is at 6.00am. If I need to get this flight I have to be at the airport by 4.00 am, which is impossible for me based on my location. I booked a premium ticket so I tried to change the date but I have to admit that I choose the wrong date in panic. Then I tried to cancel the ticket but the AirAsia agent told me that they can't refund the amount. It is their mistake for cancelling the flight and they won't refund for it. I usually prefer Indigo, I have never faced such problems but for a change I went with AirAsia for the first time and now I really regret my decision. I will never ever choose AirAsia again in my life time. This is opinion.",,,,,
"  I had worst experience with Air Asia airlines today with flight from Delhi to Jaipur. At check-in unnecessary harassment to my 14year old, first with ID, not convinced with Aadhar card. I had to rush to give money he asked to pay as compensation, as my child's boarding had started. I had no option but to give money. Allowed luggage is 25kg, which I clarified twice before doing online check in, this guy says only 15kg. Now again pay money for extra luggage.  Very disappointed with AirAsia India.",,,,,
"  I want to highlight 2 pathetic experiences of AirAsia India here; One is the latest one wherein my younger sister was forced to miss her flight when no assistance was provided to her and she was held back by the staff till 2.30 when she had reached the airport at 2.05 PM. No one had helped her by escorting her through the security check. My sister is 18 years old and was travelling to Srinagar, AirForce Station to my sister, I purposely booked AirAsia, because I being a Tata employee prefer Tata products and services and also my sister being travelling for the first time alone, I took the leap of faith in AirAsia. However, rather than getting assistance she was stopped and held back by the staff of AirAsia itself which led to waste her time and missing her flight. When tried to negotiate with the staff they offered her to pay them 8000/- INR for the upcoming flight. I tried to speak to one of the executives over the phone and she rudely responded saying that drop an email, I can't help. I am done with AirAsia India and would definitely make sure for everyone around me.",,,,,
"  I had booked this flight a long time back in February so the fares were much cheaper. The web check-in process was smooth and it is observed that if one selects the default seats, they are free of cost however if one selects any other seat then a small fee needs to be paid. The bag drop was in terminal 1 of Mumbai airport which was done in a jiffy. Boarding started well ahead of time and the leather seats were good however for a taller person they might be slightly cramped. I was pleasantly surprised to know that I was entitled to a corporate meal as that was booked during the time of booking and so a small veg roll with some mango juice was provided on the flight which was quite good. The crew were friendly and welcoming during boarding / de-boarding. All in all a satisfactory flight.",,,,,
"  I booked an air ticket from the Air Asia website and paid with my MasterCard. A transaction fee was also deducted. When the flight was rescheduled, I opted for a refund. It was confirmed in the WhatsApp chat. The refund was processed on 12 Nov 2021. But the money was not received on my Card. I contacted them repeatedly regarding this issue, but every time I was informed that the money was paid from your end. I repeatedly had long queries at my bank. The bank checked everything and said no money was issued to my MasterCard. I have been contacting them for more than 2 months at least 10 times. No effort was made by them to refund. Only empty words. This has been a terrible experience for me. 
",,,,,
"  We had booked tickets to Bangalore back in January where the fares were pretty reasonable. It was observed that during the online check in, once can do the process 12-14 days before the flight and also the default seat selection was free of charge which is well appreciated as other LCCs usually need the passenger to purchase the seat. The baggage drop was smooth process and the boarding also started on time and was greeted upon boarding by a crew member. The seats were comfortable enough however on longer flights this could be an issue where the seats might be cramped for someone on the taller side. The flight itself was uneventful however before landing, the crew distributed small perfume bottles which was a very nice and unexpected touch because in this era where airlines try to look for every opportunity to charge passengers, this gesture of providing free Titan perfumes was much appreciated. I would consider flying Air Asia India next time for the right price.",,,,,
  Worst experience from AirAsia India as the service offered were horrible and non professional. They cancelled the direct flight a day before our journey and reschedule a long connection flight for travel without our consent which made us sit in the airport waiting area for 10 hours without any customer service from the airline.,,,,,
"  Possibly the worst airline you can board. The staff is terrible and seems unpaid as rude behaviour reflects upfront. They will cool down the cabin temperature to below 18 degrees and then start renting out thin blankets for 400-500 rs. They change the gate frequently and wont send you any message. When you confront them, they will simply shrug their shoulders.  No words to define how low they can go to harass customers. Experience it on your own to know more. Do not opt for this airline. It may save you couple hundred bucks but will give you nightmares of life time.",,,,,
  Terrible airline. Please don't waste your money by choosing to fly with them. They will charge you for every ounce of luggage including laptops. Do not recommend them ever,,,,,
  I recently booked flight tickets for me and my family to fly from Hyderabad to Bangalore. But due to the bad weather condition in Bangalore and due to the heavy rains I decided to off my journey and when I decided to cancel all of my tickets the airline showed me a refund amount of not even 10% of the amount I paid. I can say that it is the worst airline ever. I not even showed up and I am cancelling it far more than 24 hours but still the refund amount is low where I felt very bad. ,,,,,
  It was a early morning flight and I was unable to do web checkin. I approach to the AirAsia desk and staff was totally unprofessional. She just ignored and start attending the other customers. After waiting for a while she just walked out from the window. I will never recommend AirAsia India. Horrible ground staff.,,,,,
" After a long time, I had decided to fly back to Bangalore on Air Asia on this afternoon flight as the timing was convenient for the arrival. A point to note is that the check in for the flight has opened almost 2 weeks before the departure of the flight as opposed to the usual 48 hours which is present on the other flights. Also another point to note is that the default seat selection which is provided by Air Asia seems to be free of cost, however if we try to change our seating rows, then a charge of Rs 250 needs to be provided for the window / aisle seats. As me and my wife were travelling together, I had decided to go with the default seat selection so as to avoid the extra seat fares. During the check-in the staff was proactive enough to accommodate me and my wife in a separate line which was faster than the usual long queues present. Also the crew wanted us to provide a feedback on the check-in process and how it could be improved and this was a pretty fun thing that was done. Boarding started well on time and one thing to note is that, if you are a person on the taller side, the seats could be a bit cramped. I have flown on other low cost carriers and Air Asia seems by far the most cramped when it comes to seat pitch. On short haul flights they are fine however on flights of more than 2 hours it could get uncomfortable. Also during boarding, I did not see the crew welcoming everyone on board which is something that was surprising considering how well the staff at the check in counters were. Flight landed well ahead of schedule and baggage was also retrieved quickly. For the money that was paid, the service provided was nice. However seat pitch is something that needs to be kept in mind.",,,,,
"  We booked our flights for 21st sep 2021 from BBI>DEL,& on 28th sep 2021 from DEL>BBI (direct flights ,no stop-over) in advance on 13th August 2021 so that we did not suffer by anything. Today we received a notification that our direct flight is going to be connecting now from BBI>PNQ>DEL (with almost 7 hour of halt in PNQ). Now my elderly parents have to wait in Pune airport for 7 hrs which making me furious. You are not able to give me earlier or later (+- 2,day flexibility) flight because you do not have any direct flight so its none of my problem. I purchase for some service and I deserve the same. ",,,,,
"  The AirAsia airline was pretty good. My height is 183cm even then I felt comfortable with the leg space. The airhostess were very polite and helpful they changed the seats too, those are willing to change there seat can change and he arranged the passengers who are sitting in middle seats to window or side corner seats and it was in budget. Tthe ground staff were also good but not so good in politeness But overall flight went well.",,,,,
  There were 3 passengers (including a kid of 2 years) and 3 cabin bags. Total weight of 3 bags was less than 21 kgs. It was just that one bag was 8kg and others very light. So it should not have been an issue. But airline staff insisted on redistributing the luggage among bags. I see no point in doing that.,,,,,
"  Made an online booking since the fares were cheaper than others. To be fair to them the flight crew were helpful and attentive on the outward journey. The return flight was cancellede. We were promised a refund. After a month of waiting, started communicating via e mails. Absolutely no response. Calls and mails received but no refund. After much follow up and constantly asking received my refund after 6 weeks.",,,,,
 Extremely wonderful. Definitely worth flying with again. Wonderful and attentive crew members. Cheerful and always with a ready to help attitude. Keep up the good work.,,,,,
"  I would like to share the pleasant experience I had, flying the Air Asia from Bangalore to Jaipur via Hyderabad on 19th Feb'21. It was my 15th Yr wedding anniversary and I wanted to make it special for my wife. So, I checked with the cabin crew if they could do something special for the occasion and they immediately obliged and made a special announcement wishing myself and my wife and the entire cabin crew came and wished us and sang for us which was amazing. They surprised my wife with the gift I had bought for her and made me propose in the flight which was romantic and nice. The cabin crew members Bindu and team where really amazing and they did a fantastic job. Like to thank them and the captain for making our day special and something to remember forever. ",,,,,
  Kudos to the entire team! I had a morning flight from Bagdogra to Kolkata. It was a short flight but I must say I had one of the best experience so far. Smooth and Comfortable! A special mention of in-flight attendants Anjita and Deepika they definitely deserve praise especially in time of COVID. The safety was well taken care of. They were extremely hospitable and at the same time professional. Keep up the good work!,,,,,
  They are not responsible and do not care about their customers. They haven't approved a cancellation of my ticket since 2 months now. Also there is absolutely no one taking the responsibility. The flight timings were changed and I cancelled the ticket due to that. I have no idea what is it gonna take for them to respond to their customer.,,,,,
  Pune to Jaipur. I paid for a flight I didn't even get on due to lockdown.  I applied for cancellation right away but so far got nothing in return for that flight. And since the day I applied for cancellation I kept contacting the flight but they kept wasting my time for a month and still I got nothing. ,,,,,
"  Mumbai to Delhi. Reaching 30 minute before departure time, the staff didn’t let board. I got stuck in roadside traffic on the western expressway. I requested a lot with the available staff but he didn’t listen my request and denied. I complained on AirAsia India feedback but they just close my case without any investigation or taken any steps. ",,,,,
"  AirAsia India is not customer-oriented air carrier. In Covid-19 spread issue, they are allowing to cancel tickets but refund will be in the form of credit points which can be used later. And allowing to reschedule the itinerary with payment of ticket difference amount. ",,,,,
"  Melbourne to Amritsar via Kuala Lumpur. This is one of the worst airlines out there in terms of getting into contact with. They have no telephone service in countries outside India so it is impossible to get into contact with them when you need help. Their AVA service on their website is completely useless. For the low price, which is technically not because with all the add ons such as seat prices and bag prices  all add up to be normal prices of flights with other airlines.",,,,,
"  Delhi to Bangalore via Hyderabad. We had extra luggage of 6 kgs and we were ready to pay for it, but the lady responsible for our check in was determined to make us pay extra (first she told for 1kg extra luggage we will have to pay 580, which should be 400, we were 2 people and the total check in baggage was exact 30 kg - one 18 and other one 12 - she said if we pay her 1100 extra, then only she will be able to allow both luggage, then she said that the cabin bag is bigger than permitted size and we will have to pay extra.  It was a very bad experience for me since I had to move a lot of things right over there in order to balance the weights. ",,,,,
"  I booked my flight from Chennai to Delhi in February, travel date March 21st. 4 tickets including 2 kids. Because of coronavirus I asked to cancel my ticket. But they told me cancellation charges will apply. This critical situation also they not waive the cancel charges. Return flight I booked with IndiGo, they waive the cancel charges and refund full amount.",,,,,
"  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality Of AirAsia India. In fact the cabin crew was really 5star in service, especial thanks to Manthan the cabin crew purser on our flight from Pune to Jaipur on 9th March.",,,,,
  Mumbai to Srinagar via Delhi. Selected the flight due to least trouble of not changing the plane at Delhi and paid extra fare for seat selection. It was good till we landed at Delhi. There I was handed a new boarding pass and was made to run from one plane to another boarding gate undergoing the security once again. The airline had changed the flight and even changed the seat as per their choice without a word of sorry. ,,,,,
"  Bengaluru to Mumbai on Air Asia India was taken this early morning and the check in process was smooth enough at Bangalore where after getting the boarding passes printed out at the kiosks. As my check in baggage weight exceeded the 15kg free allowance as I had extra luggage packed, I was made to pay around 375 Rs for every extra kg and the staff there were generous enough to waive off 1 kg extra in exchange for a South Indian breakfast on the flight which was reasonable enough. The boarding started on time and there was some nice funky boarding music being played and the seats were comfortable enough although on longer duration trips, it could be uncomfortable. The flight departed on time and even though the flight was full, the crew were very nice and after takeoff I even got the South Indian breakfast which consisted of an idli, medu vada with sambhaar and upma. The meal was decent enough although if one has to purchase this directly in-flight, it was quite pricey at around 350 INR and maybe the quantity does not justify the price. But then again, low cost carriers aren't exactly known for being generous when it comes to inflight food and beverages. Landing was on time and retrieval of the baggage was also swift. I would say that the flight was quite nice and even though low cost carriers try to maximize revenue through ancillary services (meals / excess baggage) they provide the best functional experience when it comes to taking you from point A to point B. And Air Asia does that pretty well. I cannot think of any area which was lacking on this flight. Keep it up.",,,,,
  Delhi to Chennai. Not on time departure. Senior crew member doesnt know how to respect the passenger. Went on to an argument with the crew for money exchange. I was not handled properly. Didnt get a message either for the delay I had to rush and come later found the flight was delayed. Staffs in Airport were awesome. Corporate meal info was not mentioned on the ticket. Need to learn a lot from Indigo.,,,,,
  Chandigarh to Delhi. Worst experience ever. Made me pay more for luggage than I did for the flight. Also flight was late and nobody from the staff was at the gate to answer any questions. Not traveling from this ever again.,,,,,
"  Delhi to Ranchi . Worst service, it got delayed for 2 hours initially then for 1 hour and after that they stopped informing about how much more delay will be. It was super frustrating for everyone, we pay money for comfort and service and it is worst in all cases and also asking for another ticket or refund they did not answer to that and made it even worse for us. ",,,,,
  Bengaluru to Mumbai. I  booked AirAsia India flight for 18th Dec 2019. I wanted to reschedule it. When I called airline to ask for cancellation first they told they can not reschedule it.  They are taking 2000 rs penalty charge for rescheduling. This is an unreasonable demand. ,,,,,
"  Was supposed to fly from Bangalore to Kochi on 12th November 2019. As per the timing on the ticket which I booked in May was 9.35 AM. I reached the airport early at 6 AM. I proceeded to check in counter, and was shocked to find out that the the flight took of at around 5.20 AM. But in the ticket the time clearly shows 9.35 AM. If you had rescheduled the flight it's your (AirAsia) responsibility to inform the passenger or issue a ticket with the right Timing. Before booking I checked the timings with 2 travel agencies and on make my trip and all mentioned a flight at 9.35AM I never got a message not a phone call about any change in time. ",,,,,
  Pune to Bangalore. I had ordered a meal (non-veg) by prebooking it. However I was not served the meal which I had ordered. I want the refund of the prebooked meal. I am disappointed with the service that the airline provided.,,,,,
"  Mumbai to Bengaluru. The staff at check in told me about the extra hand luggage, but did not inform me about the exact cost that could be charged during boarding. For check in, they charged me even for 1kg extra. Zero tolerance. At the time of boarding they demanded Rs 4000 for 2kgs extra hand luggage. They said that they would not let me take the flight without paying 4k. Untrained and manner ess staff.",,,,,
 Ranchi to New Delhi. Extremely poor services. Flight delayed with no information. No staff ready to talk at the airport and behaving as a layman. Extremely poor. Feared of missing my next flight from Delhi as it would put me in a heavy economic and social loss.,,,,,
  Jaipur to Kuala Lumpur. Very frustrating experience. Really felt humiliated by the behavior of staff. First he told me to arrange luggage according to the pnr. We had 2 bookings. And there was total check in baggage allowance of 120 kg. But 2 of our members were not present so total 80kg baggage allowance was allowed. Thats okay I can understand this. Then next the guy told us to make 20kg according to the pnrs. He was not ready to consider both bookings simultaneously. . One of our group member doesn't have last name so booking was like First name and staff there was not ready to allow us to board. One of their staff was talking in a very rude way. Then we moved to airline's next boarding pass check station. The guy there also stopped us and kept us waiting for 5 mins for the same issue (first name and last name). He told us to wait so that he can confirm at the check-in desk.,,,,,
 AirAsia India from Bengaluru to Delhi. The original time of departure was 00.05 hours however there was a delay of 15 minutes which was communicated in advance. The boarding pass print and check in of the baggage was performed at the designated points. Boarding was slightly delayed and as a result of which we ended up being delayed by over 20 minutes. The seats inside the Airbus were comfortable enough although it could be uncomfortable for longer flights. Seat pitch was comfortable at 30 inches and for someone who is 5'10 it was okay. The crew were very proactive and good. I observed that the crew even provided infant seat belts and snack items. We landed at Delhi around 20-25 minutes behind schedule and the baggage collecting took some time on the coveyor belt. Overall I'd say that if you get this flight for a good price and for a reasonable distance it is okay.,,,,,
Mumbai to Bengaluru. This is the first time I flew AirAsia but I had a wonderful experience. I normally feel sick during take-off and landing but I loved the smooth take-off and landing. Would love to fly only in AirAsia henceforth. Thank you,,,,,
" Extremely wonderful customer support service as compared to other competitors in the market. My query was resolved within 5 minutes, that was through live chat rather than waiting for hours holding the call. Very happy with the service. ",,,,,
"  Mumbai to Kochi. The flight got rerouted, the was no transperancy by the airline. They shuttled us around for over 6 hours and were not cooperative, they lost our luggage. Reboarded us in Bangalore and didn't offer refund. They were not open to providing food or accomodation. Where we could not go and settle into a hotel. Had to spend the night in the airport without our luggage.",,,,,
"  I came from Bangalore to Mumbai yesterday it was delayed half an hour. Today I am going back to Bangalore, which I have booked at 6:30 but it’s delayed to 10:50pm - again it’s delayed departure time is 11:40pm. This is first time am using AirAsia India but very bad experience. These people are not professional.",,,,,
"  Hyderabad to Mumbai. Absolutely horrifying experience with the staff, after a delay due to heavy rains in Mumbai. The staff had no information, no updates given to passengers. Later our boarding passes were revoked since they wanted us to fly by another airline after 7 hours of delay, and only to find out that the other airline is already full and boarding gates have been closed. There was chaos at the airport, clueless till then end about their actual journey to Mumbai.",,,,,
"  Hyderabad to Delhi. This is my second trip on AirAsia India and I came to know only after reaching the airport. No call, SMS etc. During my last travel also, there was no prior intimation and the flight kept getting delayed after I reached the airport. I had to take an off from office the next day due to AirAsia. I understand that airlines have operational issues causing delays but not informing the customers is unacceptable.",,,,,
 Kochi to Mumbai. The seating was very uncomfortable with less legroom. The flight crew as well was unfriendly and unpleasant. The upright position of the seat itself was difficult to deal with. Overall a pretty unpleasant and unfriendly flight experience. Not recommended at all.,,,,,
"  Delhi to Hyderabad on 16 June 2019. The flight landed one hour late in the night and I couldn’t find my baggage in the belt. When I checked with AirAsia customer support they told me that the bag doesnt come with the flight and I need to wait for the next flight for my baggage. Since its already late at night, I asked whether they could deliver it to my home. They said they cant do that because this facility not available for domestic flights. Then I had to sit near to their counter and continuously enquire about the status.  I called the customer service to find alternate option and they suggested me to fill some feedback form from their website (I didnt understand how that will help to get my baggage). They are not even accepting that its their mistake.",,,,,
"  The company doesn't have any live customer care people to talk to which in times us really needed to get important information easily. Their so called virtual assistant AVA is of no use. I tried checking my flight rescheduled time number of times and all the time the result was ""there are no flights"". Thirdly, the flight which was supposed to be departed around 8pm it got rescheduled 3 times which in turn made the flight to be departed at 1 am next day. The boarding in the plane started at 12:45 am which delayed the flight further. Lastly, there were no announcements being made regarding this matter. ",,,,,
  Kolkata to Bangalore. Amazing quality. One of the best experiences I have had while flying. Just that there were not a lot of choices for food items. A few flight merchandise were expensive. Otherwise its an amazing experience to fly by AirAsia.,,,,,
  Pune to Delhi. I was asked to pay more for a couple of extra kgs luggage and on top of that the rep asked if i would like to buy a better seat. When i confirmed the seat she still chose to not to hear it and give me a seat in Row 26.,,,,,
  Hyderabad to Delhi. Flight was delayed for 4 hours. First we were asked to report at one gate and then they changed the gate no 3 times. No one was bothered to inform us properly for the cause of delay.  I will never fly with AirAsia India again.,,,,,
" Bengaluru to Delhi. Low cost carrier that provides low leg space, below average food menu, average service and zero tolerance to excess baggage. Avoid if you can pay a little more for better comfort. Clean aircraft and helpful crew.",,,,,
"  Hyderabad to Delhi. We were to fly from Hyderabad to Delhi, schedule departure was 2025 hrs, departed at 0005 hrs. Horrible Customer experience: Gate changed 5 times in 3 hours. Caused so much inconvenience for kids and the elderly. Some passengers were initially allowed to board a bus to the flight. They were deboarded and the aircraft was rerouted to Kolkata. Delhi passengers had to face the brunt. Finally, they brought an aircraft which was in HYD and same was used 4 hours later",,,,,
  Guwahati to Delhi. We get it its a budget airline. But if the flight is getting delayed then you should let the passengers know about the delay beforehand and not 1 hour before the flight.,,,,,
"  Guwahati to Bangalore. I was travelling with my 2 year old son who was down with fever. The crew was very kind and empathetic and took personal care of us. On board one staff in particular made the journey very comfortable. Ground Staff was very helpful in Bangalore airport. Thank you very much to all the staff. Despite the flight delay, they were all so warm and helpful. I look forward to flying with AirAsia again.",,,,,
  Flew from Indore to Goa on Air Asia. Check in was easy - we opted for the paid front row seats and got them easily. Flight on time and ground staff were well trained. Crew on board however were very casual. The inflight supervisor spent the entire time while boarding was going checking her phone and chatting with other staff. Flight otherwise quite okay.,,,,,
"  Bangalore to Kochi. One of my most favorite flight is now AirAsia. All the flight and ground staff are so amazing, good and polite. The most important thing for a passenger is the quick response for their queries. Its easy to connect with the representative and clarify everything which we require. Most attactive is the staff performance and dedication towards their job.",,,,,
"  Ranchi to Bangalore. This was my first and last time traveling with AirAsia India. It was okay when the flight was rescheduled, but got frustrated after taking boarding pass, flight got rescheduled again 1 hour. I can understand there will be rescheduling but this is a very bad experience. Had a bad time for over 3 hours in this flight.",,,,,
  Goa to Hyderabad. The service by the inflight attendants was very good. The flight was the smoothest of all I had ever experienced. Even though the take off was a bit delayed the captain saw that we reach our destination on time. And the landing was the smoothest I ever experienced. The food options in their menu was also awesome.,,,,,
  Bangalore to Hyderabad one of the worst trip I have experienced. The bus to the plane was all tightly packed and the ac was not working. Aircraft seats not at all comfortable neither the plane was cool. ,,,,,
"  Pune to Kolkata. Lowest leg space provided by AirAsia India in the domestic sector. No self check in kiosk facility available. The seats are preassigned as per their convenience and they don't change it as per your preference at the airport. I had flown this airline last month on the same sector, but thought of giving it another chance. All I got was disappointment. Low cost but low quality of service.",,,,,
"  I recently booked a travel from Chennai to Kochi and paid about three times the fare as excess luggage fees. But due to an emergency 3 hours prior to the departure time, I had to cancel my trip. I called the customer service and explained my situation. They didn't even offer me partial credit for a later flight. I ended up buying another ticket, at full price, including the luggage fees, for the following week.  I would strongly recommend avoiding AirAsia at any cost!",,,,,
" Goa to New Delhi. My flight I5 799 got cancelled at the last moment. Then my ordeal started to reschedule it. The customer service is totally poor. I called 6-7 times and each person gave a different story. I did a web check in before the flight got cancelled. It took them 8.5 hours to uncheck and they kept me sleepless throughout the night saying give them a call after half an hour so that they can reschedule. They don’t have any coordination and they live in a different world isolated from customers. My dream Goa trip ended a nightmare because of this poor, unorganised, stupid care persons of this worst air line. Never ever go with Air Asia!",,,,,
"  Delhi to Kuala Lumpur. I would like to applaud the staff at the check in counter at the new Delhi airport for Air Asia. Two gentlemen in particular provided an excellent customer service in what could have become an issue for us and caused us major delays. They took extra initiative, made phone calls and assured us that the problem would be resolved soon. By keeping us in the loop and ensuring we made our next connecting flight on time. Thank you.",,,,,
  Jaipur to Bangalore. Worst airline to travel. Reschedule flight 2 times. No intimation for the same. Poor seating arrangement. Bad leg space and seat recline system. Other airlines offer better leg space. Overall bad experience.,,,,,
"  Jaipur to Pune. I was on a family vacation with my wife and 2 kids. I could not do web check-in and I see all the seats gray out saying seats are booked and not available. Auto allocation of seats provided my both kids seats on 3rd Row and for me and my wife in the 28th row. At the counter on airport, when I asked to provide seats for all members in one row, they say either you sit on the allocated seats or I have option in paid seats. So to sit with family I had to pay 750 RS extra.",,,,,
"  Bangalore to Delhi. We are a couple travelling. We are tried doing web check 10 hours before the flight and it showed us seats at different places. Hence we didn't do it. We came to counter 1 hr 30 mins before and the attendee allocated same seats which were showing while we tried web check in and she was saying no seats left, only paid seats are left. Now we have to come at least one day before to do check in.",,,,,
" Vishakhapatnam to Bangalore. Me and my young daughter were travelling. We were given seats in different parts of the aircraft and ground staff said if we want to sit next to each other we need to pay for the seat. This is really cheap tricks. if they want us to pay for this, why don't they include in the ticket price? I will never travel AirAsia again. Pathetic",,,,,
" Bengaluru to Chennai. We were made to wait for half an hour in the baggage drop line. Line was short, staff were inefficient. Our e-boarding pass expired before our flight and we had to get a new one with different seats. We had to wait for the bus again for 10 minutes in the hot sun before we could board the flight. We took AirAsia from Chennai to Bangalore as well. Similar experience. Staff are inefficient (ground crew) and processes terrible. Not recommended at all.",,,,,
" Travelled to Banglore from Hyderabad in AirAsia. It was my first experience with them. It was a nice experience and the staff were kind and gentle. The main problem we faced was the price of food and drink. What were those prices? Those amounts were too much to be paid. We paid good amount for the travel, then why do you charge so high for food? The rest of the facilities were great.",,,,,
" Guwahati to Delhi. The flight arrival was not on time, they said there are weather issues as reason for delay which there was not. Normal weather outside at time of landing, booked cabs missed, reached home late, was veryhungry and tired. I requested a window seat but they denied that as well.",,,,,
  I had a connecting flight from Okinawa to Osaka that was delayed by two hours. That airline made every accommodation to help me to make the AirAsia flight to Manila. Despite sprinting through the airport and arriving at check in 50 minutes before the flight was supposed to depart AirAsia would not check me in. I didn’t even have check baggage. ,,,,,
"  Our flight was cancelled 2 weeks before departure. We followed the instructions in the email for refund since Oct 2022, we are still waiting for our refund. We are a group of 7 pax, nobody receive the refund yet. Apparently, this is a common practise from Air Asia. I feel I'm being scammed. Never encounter such lousy customer service for a refund. ",,,,,
"  Flew this airline for the first time from Manila to Tokyo Narita (roundtrip ticket). I get that it’s a budget airline, but it was disappointing.  In my opinion, when you add the budget fare with add-ons such as bags (bags are only 1 piece, 20kg), you’re paying even more than you would a 5-star airline where there is at least 1 free checked bag, 23kg.  The ground staff were friendly enough. The boarding passes were printed on receipt-like paper, a cost cutting measure I don’t really mind. While waiting at the gate, there was no announcement that the gate had changed. There was just a sign  facing away from us indicating where the new gate was. Good thing my group saw a friend on the same flight, who had checked in much later, and we found out that they had a different gate printed. The seats were cramped and uncomfortable. The cabin crew were fine.",,,,,
"  Horrible experience all around. Purchased 2 tickets at the same time for my girlfriend and I, the airline sat us in different seats without resolving the issue. Technical difficulties at the counter which caused long check in times. I do not recommend flying this airline if you're not from the region. I don't recommend flying this airline even if you are from the region.",,,,,
"  The food on board are salty and expensive. Our flight going to Phuket was delayed but the boarding crews didn’t inform the passengers. Coming back to Philippines, check in crew was grumpy and the boarding crew was not friendly",,,,,
"  Checked in online, we already have e-boarding pass but we had to fall in line again to check in again and again. We thought that online check will be easier and hassle free. Not in this airline.",,,,,
"  Takes ages for a bag drop off in Manila after online check-in. Attendants, although pleasant, ask too many questions. Aircraft was so hot, we stayed on tarmac for half an hour, 30C in the cabin, no drink offered. I appreciate wider seat as a plus size person!",,,,,
"  Awful airline, avoid at all costs. Firstly it was over an hour delayed with no explanation. The organisation by the staff was a total mess. Then herded into buses to get to the plane and left waiting on the bus for nearly half an hour while those in the previous flight got off (why couldn't this be done before?). Then totally inflexible and clueless cabin crew and took forever to get bags the other end (again zero communication or explanation for this, no respect for customers).",,,,,
"  On Sunday 13/11/22 I was going back from Iloilo to Manila and had a connection with Emirates. Between 2 and 3 am I got an email that my flight is delayed by like 4 hours. Of course I was only aware of this around 8 am when I woke up. So needed to rebook the Emirates flights which I barely managed to do because of time concerns and cost me an extra 260 pounds. Also what if I can't rebook it how do I get home? When I asked for some kind of compensation they answered since I didn't have an insurance I am not eligible for one. All I got was a little rice with McDonalds chicken and some water. If this was not enough after we boarded they made us wait another hour inside the plane so the originally 13:15 flight took off around 17:50. The first 25 mins they announced, but the rest was not communicated at all. This was my first and last travel with the company. I am disappointed and can't recommend at all",,,,,
" Late late late. A short trip from Boracay (Caticlan) back to Manila. We were originally booked on flight Z2 224 buy when we checked in at Caticlan (MPT) they moved us to the earlier Z2 226 because 224 was delayed. 226 ended up delayed anyway, so we were still late. Whilst I cannot recommend them based on punctuality, the cabin crew were lovely (and apologetic), the seats were fine (we had 8D and 8E, so quite near the front) but looking at Flight Radar 24, the plane is 15 years old and this was very noticeable. I had a snack on board and a coffee, and these were distinctly average. The human element to this flight was excellent (ie the cabin crew) but everything else was average at best, and bad at worst.",,,,,
" I cannot fault this flight - a short hop from Manila to Boracay. It's only a 45 minute flight, we left on time and arrived early. Like many budget airlines, Air Asia doesn't offer major luxury or anything, but for the price paid, for the punctuality, the polite cabin crew, I was very happy. I travelled with my partner in seats 6A and 6B, and being at the front we were very comfortable and able to disembark quickly.",,,,,
  Booked flight to connect with my international flight arriving in Manila. Airasia brought forward the flight to a time which I couldn’t make due to my flight arriving later than the rescheduled time. Tried many times to get refund but just get invalid claim due to flight not being cancelled by AirAsia. There is no way to get in touch with them to get refund. I still don’t have refund.,,,,,
  I booked a connecting flight from Manila to Tacloban few weeks ago then Airasia cancelled and rebook my flight 1hr after my arrival from international flight. Then when I tried to re book the customer service is doesnt want to entertain my issue. I had no choice but to rebook it the next flight. I have waited 9 hrs at Manila then 2 hrs before the scheduled departure they announce again there will be delay of flight. ,,,,,
  Worst airline ever. I’ve never known an airline that makes so many schedule changes a few hours before boarding time. We’re already on our way to airport then suddenly I receive an email from them that our flight schedule have change from 6pm boarding to 10pm. I cannot recall how may times they’ve change our schedule but i got home at 1am.  I will never fly again with Airasia!,,,,,
"  Worst airline ever. I’ve never known an airline that makes so many schedule changes a few hours before boarding time. A few days ago they’ve changed the flight time to 6 hrs later, and on the day of the flight, they’ve changed it to at least 4-5 times. When I got to the check in counters, it’s the longest of lines I’ve ever seen in different queues with literally no one specifying which category is which. ",,,,,
"  AirAsia Philippines has thus far refused to refund the sum of a cancelled flight back to my bank account, even though it promised to do so. Out of all airlines I have used, this one seems to be the worst. There are no words for the lack of service I have received after putting so much trust in them. ",,,,,
  Hopeless airline for advance planning and reserving hotels etc. Twice now I have booked AirAsia from Clark to Catilclan and both times they have changed the flight dates with only one month before flying. For Boracay it is a requirement to have pre-booked hotel accommodation so this now has to be changed - assuming we can. Last time we had to book an extra night in Caticlan as the flight date and flight time were changed. Why are they so useless at planning their schedules. Trying to book and then change hotel dates is a nightmare with Air Asia flights. They need to sort out their schedules in advance and stop being unprofessional. I know they are a budget airline but they need to try and up their game and stop behaving like one.,,,,,
"  The worst experience with dealing with an airline, that I have ever had in my life. My two friends and I booked 3 flights with AirAsia as it came up as the cheapest option on our routes. What are the odds of one airlines messing up all three flights? Well, somehow AirAsia managed to do exactly that! Two flights they cancelled before our travels commenced. This meant we had to rebook our flights with a different airline at a much higher late as it was closer to the travel date. More than 2.5 months after AirAsia cancelled their flights, we are still waiting for a refund. They are taking this long to refund us for flights that they cancelled. I have followed up multiple times with no success. The third flight was moved earlier about 4 hours, which was frustrating as we had to get up at 4:30am to be able to get to the airport on time. It was annoying but we did it because we were just grateful that they didn’t cancel this one. At the airport it was absolute chaos, they had one single queue for all of their flights, so we stood in line for about 2 hours for check-in. It was getting close to the time that our flight check-in time was going to close, so we proactively approached the ‘last call’ desk to let them know the situation and request that we be able to check-in. The Air Asia staff at the counter told us we couldn’t yet as our flight hadn’t been announced for last call and to return in 20 minutes. So, we waited for 20 minutes as she had told us to and returned to the last call desk to check-in after that. Now their staff told us that we were too late to check-in and we couldn’t board the plane? After telling us 20 minutes ago that it was too early for last call check-in and to wait for 20 minutes, they changed their story and said we had missed last call check-in and were unable to board. The first staff member had given us incorrect information, her superiors apologised for her miscommunication but still would not let us board our flight. AirAsia took zero responsibility for the mess that they caused. We had to book our flight with another airlines for 3x the price of our original flight plus bear the cost of the missed Air Asia flight. We also had to wait at the airport for 4 hours and miss the activities we had planned for that day.",,,,,
"  This is the airline I experienced that the system will choose the seat number. We are 3 on board, checked in 5 hours before the flight, checked in together and how come that we are seated far from each other. As per the staff, seats should be purchase online. Really? Way to make money! Our flight was rescheduled and there is no even sign of gratification even having just the great service to compensate the delay.",,,,,
"  Second time i have flown with AirAsia Philippines, reason being the flight time was ideal for my connection coming in from London, it gave me 2 hours to transfer from Term 1 in Manila to Term 4. Well that's what i thought until Air Asia decided to cancel my flight and transfer me to a flight some 7 hours later with no explanation. Upon checking in no apology was given, however my blood shot did cause a stir, i explained it was a burst blood vessel which was confirmed by my doctor in the UK, the member of staff on check in, told me to wait as she needed to consult her supervisor. I was told by the supervisor i needed to see a doctor who was based at the airport, i tried to explain but he wasn't having any of it, it was either i saw the doctor or i wasn't be allowed to fly. Eventually i was seen, firstly by a nurse, who took my blood pressure & asked me a number of questions about my eye, i did inform her that i was not feeling any discomfort, no itching, no blurred visor, in-fact nothing at all. Even telling them i had flown some 7000 miles for 15 hours from London with no problem. The doctor as soon as she arrived said it was ok for me to fly if i sign an indemnity, after all that i asked why they were so interested in my eye, yet no tests / questions were ask regarding Covid, no answer. Once on board all was ok, I am not a mask wearer as this is not required at home, i know ""when in roam"" but within the airport & on the plane I was never asked to wear one. ",,,,,
"  One of the worst airlines have to deal with. Air Asia cancelled the round trip flight from Cebu, Philippines to Davao, Philippines for June 25, 2022. Requested via email to refund my money but refused. Was credited the amount for further flights but explained to them that I no longer am able to fly with the airlines because I am just gonna be there on vacation. Why am I not allowed to get my money back when the Air Asia was the one who cancelled the trip not me. Just like a lot of reviews online with Air Asia, it is very very very hard to request anything from them. They will make you go through a lot of verification and protocols over and over again. Such a disappointing experience considering this is my first time with them.",,,,,
"  AirAsia is not a reliable airline, often flight schedule changes, and does not care for customers welfare. It is one of the worst airlines I have ever flown with. My flight ticket was from MNL-CGY and vice versa. First, my MNL-CGY flight scheduled at 14:20 was moved to 19:45, though there was one email prior notice. However, on my CGY-MNL return flight originally scheduled at 14:10, upon arrival at Laguindingan Airport, I and other passengers were told that the flight would be moved to 20:30 without prior notice. As we were waiting patiently, time has passed and the earlier announced 20:30 became 22:00. Air Asia ground crew did not even show courtesy by asking for apology nor give any explanation, and did not even offer water to the customers during the tiring and frustrating nine hours of waiting just to appease our disappointment. The company did not show any care or respect to their customers. I strongly discourage other flyers to try flying AirAsia.",,,,,
"  We booked AirAsia Philippines as we still have a credit from the covid cancelled flights. The flight from Caticlan to Manila was okay, however, there was a delay by air traffic control. Then we had to check in for our flight from Manila to Bohol (Tagbilaran). Arriving at Manila Airport 3.5 hours before departure was a good thing as we were standing for 2 hours in the check-in queue. The had only 4 agents for 500+ passengers. The agents were working very slowly and made long explainations to the customers. According to the security working there, it happens every day. The Cebupacific check-in was working much faster. There is no family check-in. Everyone had to stay in the queue in the terminal. After boarding we had the next unpleasant surprise. When the plane made it to the runway the captain reported a technical problem and we had to go out of the broken plane and enter a replacement plane. So we were 2.5 hours late in Bohol.",,,,,
" This airline ruined my long-planned vacation after canceling my flight from Boracay to Cebu which left me with only 2 choices, travel fund or reschedule a month after the original flight booked because they canceled the route. I asked them to fly me from Caticlan to Cebu via Manila because they still operate those flights under AirAsia Philippines, but to no avail. After spending almost 1000 dollars on advanced bookings, my only option is to purchase new tickets which costs almost 8 times more than it was before with another airline. AirAsia is selling fake flights to grab your money and keep it with them as much as they could, limiting your options to impossible and doesn't care ruining your holiday. I've been reading several comments on their Facebook page even way back to 2018 postings, this is a common practice for this airline as ranted by thousands of people who had similar issues as mine. I wonder when the government would revoke their franchise for fooling a lot of people already. The major swindler of the airline, probably in the whole world. My only wish is for this airline's closure.",,,,,
 Airasia calcelled my flight from Bali to the Philippines because of covid19. I was promised to get a refund for this specific cancellation. After waiting for it for 4 months they rejected the refund. Even tho it was even promised on their website. So now i dont get refunded nor i get credits and lost 200€ for a flight that never went up in the air. Plus it is impossible to contact AirAsia  in any way accept for the automatic AVA. ,,,,,
"  The only number available to call anyone for help is long distance to India and after waiting on hold for an hour (paying for a call to India), they say they only handle domestic flights in India. At least the Indian guy confirmed that there is no other number and you have to ""chat"" online, and the wait is over an hour for that too. And there is no countdown to your time to chat, and no audible alert when your agent is available, so you have to literally stare at the screen for an hour and hope you happen to see when they show up. If you don't respond within 60 seconds, they end the chat. If you are waiting for the agent to type or look something up for longer than 60 seconds, it ends the chat. So you have to keep typing ""still here."" Absolutely ridiculous. I was contacting them because they had sent an email saying I am eligible for a flight credit for my flight that They cancelled, but their website is so bad it didn't let me claim that credit. Nothing but errors and missing flight information. Then the agent said I wasn't eligible for a credit, despite the email They sent affirming that I would get a credit. I sent him the email, and he didn't budge. ",,,,,
"  
AirAsia Philippines the worst airline I have ever booked and flown with. They ghost their customers regarding refunds, constantly disconnect/change the phone lines, don't have email support, and no one answers DMs on Facebook or Twitter. The only other support you get is Ava which is a useless, infuriating bot. I tried to go to the airport to speak with them but the security told me AirAsia Philippines doesn't allow face to face.  I had my flights canceled four different times, and finally on the last one I just went to the airport and asked to be put on another flight because there were empty seats. They kept saying it was full. I insisted that this was unfair and pointed out several examples of hypocrisy and finally they let me on, but not before charging me $120. I had $150 in credits but they wouldn't let me use that towards the flight even though I purchased travel insurance and premium flex which is what this is for. They are trying to avoid letting people use their credits. ",,,,,
"  My original flight was cancelled one day before the supposed itinerary due economical reasons by AirAsia. A full refund on the credit card was promised. After 3 months I got a credit for future flights without having an option to choose.  In the end I tried to move to flight to a later date without any success. I was the chat several hours waiting. The emergency hotline if you get connected kicks you out after 10 min in the waiting line. When i got connected to service staff, she was not helpful to move the flight.  Overall contact from the customer to the airline seems not to be wanted from the side of Air Asia.",,,,,
"  Manila to Bangkok. This multiple cancelations of flight due to COVID has been a total nightmare with a system like this. Since they did not have any live chat I went through their chatbot to see the recourse available for those no longer willing fly. Going through their available options I made a case for voluntary cancellation since there were no other options for cancelations and their offer here was to give you flight credits valid for one year for the same amount you initially paid which I figured was better than nothing, after three days after filling my case I was sent an email offering me an option for a full refund since my flight was canceled due to the government banning all flights. I took up the offer and filled for the full refund case. I checked with the chatbot to cancel my initial case since I wanted the full refund instead but no option was available. I tried to get in touch with them so many times so that I can remove the initial case and only go through the full refund but I cannot reach anyone. After a month they processed the flight credits refund, I got in contact with their live chat (yes I had to way and hour) to explain my case mix up but they're adamant to just give me the flight credits rather than a full refund! ",,,,,
"  Caticlan to Manila. They make it impossible to obtain a refund on flights they cancel because of covid19. The only way they will allow you to interact with them is via a chatline, which invariably takes hours to get through to. Once you're through, they try to fob you off with a credit and when you insist on your legal right to a refund, they tell you it could take 6 months and even that is not guaranteed. Don't be put off by taking a credit if you don;t want that.",,,,,
"  Manila to Tacloban booked for September 2020. I booked a ticket no problem using a combination of miles and cash (paid by credit card), but after a month I received an email saying that they couldn't process my booking with miles so I have 48 hours to pay the extra fee, otherwise the ticket will be cancelled and I will get my money back. However, after more than 2 months I haven't received any money back. I tried to contact the airline through Twitter, I received a message saying that the payment was late so there is no booking, I asked them to return my money, as they promised in their email, but no reply since then.

"  Cebu to Davao. Has been delayed and delayed with no reason? My flight Is at 7am. Has been delayed with no reason to 8:30am, they start to say “due to operation” and delayed again to 9am and announced again with just saying “further delaying” to 10am. I’m not sure if I can take this flight today. There’s no respect to customers at least have to provide a reason or something.",,,,,
"  Worst experience with an airline. Very disappointing I bought a flight ticket to Hanoi with a transfer in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The Taiwan government site says I do not need a transfer visa as long I don’t leave the airport. However AirAsia doesn’t have the facility that allows me to remain in the airport without a visa, so I couldn’t get in the flight and they didn’t refund me. They should have given the information when the purchase made.",,,,,
  Cebu to Puerto Princesa. The web site is slow and if you get it to work it will not be transferred to the airline. I paid twice for additional baggage to be told at the counter there was no record of the online transaction.,,,,,
"  Davao to Manila. Kite bag wasn't accepted as sports equipment. I've been to kite festivals in Philippines, China and Indonesia and never had a problem. The thing that made me mad was when the supervisor laughed at me when I paid the extra money.",,,,,
"  Puerto Princesa to Manila. Flight was delayed for 1hr 20mins with no notification. Only realised when the boarding time exceeded its stipulated time and no ground crew were seen at the counter at all. After half an hour, the crew finally appeared. Asked the ground crew what time was the flight arriving and they said they don't know, just wait, with a bored face. Flight finally departed 1hr 20mins later which caused me to miss my next connecting flight. No notification, no information provided, no apology and no help rendered. ",,,,,
" Our flight was smooth at first. We enjoyed our trip from Manila to Cebu. But during our return to Manila, our flight was delayed from 5pm to 5.50pm then to 7.20pm to 7.10 pm to 7.25 pm and lastly to 7.50pm. Due to these changes every minute, we have been confused and were not able to go to the gate 20mins before the final time of departure. We arrived 6 mins late and were not accepted on the gate. Our flight was forfeited and we need to book another flight to be able to return to Manila. It was so devastating and heartbreaking as we have to incur another expense to return to Manila that costs us same price of round trip from Manila to Cebu and vice versa.",,,,,
"  Manila to Taipei. This is really good, the flight attendants were pretty kind when entering the plane. They have food I like, the seat comfort is good and the landing is smooth.",,,,,
 Singapore to Cebu. Very sad about this airline. I have flown with them 3 times and all my flights with them have been delayed. ,,,,,
  No reasons given for the delay. They'll just announce that there is delayed and that's it. 2 hours delayed without nothing. And no timing as well if which time will it depart. It's difficult for us traveller of if we dont know anything regarding the flight. There are some reason that are valid or not but still have the right to know.,,,,,
"  I flew round trip from Davao City to Cebu. On the flight to Cebu I had my dive gear in an Akona Bag and was going to carry-on my regulator. They stopped me at X-ray and told me I could not carry on a regulator, so I had to go down a check it in as a checked bag. Coming back from Cebu. I prepaid for 25 kilos for my dive gear but did not tell them it’s sports equipment. So, when I checked the Akona bag in, they said it’s sports equipment and I would have to pay between p3000-5000. They said I cannot put clothes in with sports equipment. I only had that bag and a carry-on back pack for me and my girlfriend. They said I have to take the clothes out and put them in a separate bag (which I did not have). He called his supervisor and let me get away with the way I had it this one time only. ",,,,,
" Singapore to Cebu with AirAsia. Overall disappointing. First, departure was postponed for 2.5 hours. (and you can only get the money back if it is 3 hours and over!) then departure was postponed 2.5 hours. The plane was filled up and the staff spent a lot of time placing hand luggage. The seats are miserable. ",,,,,
"  Cebu to Manila. Crew were not paying attention after I ordered food and paid for it, I was told that they will heat it up for 7 minutes. They did their usual selling merchandise after offering meal and after I followed up my meal, the stewardess just said ok, but didn’t bring back the food. Until they passed by the row of my seat, I had to ask them for the food again and it was brought to me cold as the 7 minutes turned out to be about 20 minutes!",,,,,
  Cagayan de oro to Manila. Would it be hard to inform passengers that their flight will be delayed almost 4 hours? We have amongst us those who have to transfer to another flight. Passengers have to stand up and and approach staff when it is clearly their job to inform and update us. ,,,,,
"  Boracay to Manila, a 45 mins flight, zero info about delays, no screen to let people know, a few announcements here and there and a 4hr delay plus being stuck in the plane on arrival.",,,,,
"  Manila to Seoul. I checked in my luggage at Terminal 3. When arriving at the Immigration there were very long queues. I tried several times to overtake it and to talk to the Immigration Officers asking them to process my payment for resident aliens and my passport. I was told that I had to go behind the line. Once I paid my fee I was asked again to go back to the end the other lines for having my passport stamped. During my time waiting I saw ground staff of Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines and Cebu Pacific asking for passenger for their flights and accompanied the passengers to overtake the line and to be attended to immediately. Nobody from AirAsia was in that area. Arriving at the gate, I was told that the flight was closed and that my ticket was forfeited. My luggage was offloaded and I could retrieve it from the check-in counter.  I had to purchase a new ticket. I tried to claim some amount from AirAsia's insurance company who rejected my claim.",,,,,
"  Manila to Puerto Princesa. I’m not sure how some travelers rate this airline above a 3. Nearly every encounter I have with them is at best mediocre (can’t get seats together with my travel companion) to horrible. Horrible includes the fact that they are always delayed but if you are running behind they charge you a $100 “rebooking fee,” which is about what it cost for a ticket anyway. But they will tell you that a ticket costs $200 one way, which is nonsense. If I could find another way to my destination I would never fly them again. They price gouge and are inconsiderate. In fairness, their staff although appearing to work in a chaotic environment, are courteous. I sympathize with them for working for such a terrible airline.",,,,,
"  I purchased a round trip for my in-laws to visit us in Korea and made the reservation by phone direct to Air Asia Philippines. After accepting and charging my card successfully, their fraud/review department declined the transaction on the same day. I was only able to find out by calling them again the day before the flight. My in-laws ended up paying in cash at the counter in Manila and made the flight. One month later, I am still trying to get my credit card charge refunded. After 4 different support case numbers, I am still waiting 'for their investigation' even though I received an email stating the refund was made/authorized one month ago. My bank shows no incoming transactions and Air Asia would not/could not provide their transaction number that initiated the credit card refund and state that the delay is from inaction by my bank.",,,,,
"  I booked a ticket via Expedia for my girlfriend to fly from Cebu to Manila on 14th January at 17.40. The flight was confirmed to me via email along with the seat number allocated. However, when she arrived at the Air sia desk they refused to allow her to board saying that the ticket was not paid for. I insisted that the payment was made but they still refused to allow her to board. The following day I noticed that my account had been deducted for the full cost of the flight from Air Asia. I wrote to Air Asia to complain about the service and demand a refund. I had a letter of apology from them yet more than 15 days later still no refund. ",,,,,
"  The fight got delayed from Kalibo to Malina for almost 3 hours on Jan 1, 2019, for that I missed my international flight, when I asked them for a solution, they rebooked my flight which is 2 days later, they said that's the only flight with an available seat. I have to bear all the losses, my schedule has been shattered, I have to pay two days accommodation fee and extra costs, but those were not the worst part. At the check-in counter, I asked the check-in lady to provide me with a paper for the delay, so my hotel I was supposed to stay could redeem me, the lady reassured me that they would bring the paper at my next check in, that is Jan 2 10 pm, flight took off at 00:05 am, and I asked them to not forget the paper. On my next check-ins, no paper, the check-in lady was not willing to help anyway, she is very reluctant, I asked her many times, she just said ""wait"", still nothing is done. ",,,,,
" Clark to Cebu. At first, I was very happy with the price. But then I went to fully pay and the credit card processing fee was a whopping 15%! That is insane. Then I get to the airport and they tell me my toothpaste and wires need to be checked! They assured me that this was normal. I had to pay a lot extra for a checked bag and then they had a terminal fee, again overall so many hidden fees that made me furious. Just give me the right price, not some made up price and in nowhere in the world is it ok to charge someone 15% on a credit card.",,,,,
"  Manila to Taipei. It was our first time flying AirAsia. The flight turned out well, the ride was safe. We experienced some turbulence because of the bad weather, but overall it was a good experience. The seats were a little tight, not enough leg room. If you’re looking for an aircraft for short distances, try Air Asia. We also flew with AirAsia going back from Taiwan to Manila. The flight was better, and the plane and boarding were on time.",,,,,
" Davao to Manila. Swift checking again, having used this airline many times when travelling internally in the Philippines and I cannot fault their service. Crew are always friendly, cabin always clean more so price wise very competitive.",,,,,
  Manila to Davao. A very pleasant experience. The flight was so smooth and relaxing. We had a great time. The plane arrived ahead of Schedule and we arrived at our destination almost 30 minutes earlier. True value for the money we have paid. I will be flying with this airline again.,,,,,
"  Bangkok to Manila round trip. Don Mueang to Manila was 1 hour late and the return leg nearly 3hrs late due to technical problems with the aircraft. Check in in Bangkok was a zoo, Manila a little better. Flights themselves were no frills fine apart from the delays and in neither case did the captain apologise for the delay or even acknowledge it. Fare price was cheaper than Philippine Airlines or Cebu Pacific but routing through DMK instead of BKK resulted in more hassle than I'd like. Not a good choice if you have connecting flights.",,,,,
"  Manila to Puerto Prinsesa. Flight was not delayed, our flight was 5:55 we were boarded 5:20. But the aircraft didnt leave until 6:20. While waiting inside the aircraft I can hear was how annoyed the cabin crews at the back. The crews were not friendly. There was little legroom. I’m writing this review while waiting for my delayed flight going back to manila.",,,,,
"  Cebu to Manila on 16th March. More than 75 minutes delay and add to the delay with ferrying passengers by bus. No timely or accurate information about the delay. At one point the announcement was that our aircraft had not yet departed from its originating Airport, it took a passenger and his app to show the ground staff that the plane was actually half way already.",,,,,
"  Cebu to Manila. AirAsia delayed for 4 hrs to depart from Cebu bound for Manila, and their delay caused me losing my international flight bound for Doha. This led me to spend US$230 to revalidate international flight for next flight schedule and stay in Manila city for two nights. When I complain and ask for compensation AirAsia don't recognize the claim and simply gave me a nonsense reply just to wash their hands. And after they reply in next 30 mins they send another email ""Congratulating me that they successfully close the case"". What a shame. Anyone who is concerned about right use of money, time and has next flight commitment should not use AirAsia at all.",,,,,
" As I sit typing this review, our flight originally departing at 8.40pm has been delayed more than 4 hours and we have yet to begin boarding. Estimated time of boarding was at midnight. Upon check-in at 5pm this afternoon, I inquired upon an earlier flight since we have had a sudden death in the family, namely, my grandmother. We were supposed to attend her wake this evening. I was informed by airport staff that there were no earlier flights we can transfer to. Since then, we had to wait in the over-crowded and freezing cold pre-departure terminal. Food stands ran out of food due to the volume of passengers waiting at NAIA and we have been informed of delays pushing back every hour, preventing us from being able to make a decision on the most comfortable arrangement with regards to changing or keeping our flight in lieu of an overnight accommodation in Manila. Suffice it to say, we will never be flying AirAsia Philippines again and would not recommend this airline.",,,,,
" If you want to wait 2-3 extra hours due to delayed flights, AirAsia Philippines is the airline for you. Along with my boyfriend, we experienced at least a two hour delay each way from Manila to Puerto Princesa and back. The flight attendants are kind, however, all of the check in staff from Puerto Princesa airport were rude and careless. Even though you save a couple bucks with this airline, save yourself and book with a different airline even if it costs a few extra dollars.",,,,,
  We are frequent flyer of AirAsia Philippines since we find it affordable and we're comfortable with your company. But there's a need to be calibrated when it comes to your hand carry bags requirements. We're able to fly from Manila to Tagbilaran via AirAsia on October 14with our backpacks as hand carry but when we were about to fly back they insist one of our backpacks to be checked in because of the size. We asked them how AirAsia manila was able to allow us without checking it in and they are not. They are not even accomodating to help us. ,,,,,
"  Cebu to Puerto Princesa. Upon our arrival an hour in advance at the pre-departure gate we found it crowded and full of other passengers from a different flight and seats were all full, we had to wait a bit farther away from our gate. Our aircraft arrived earlier than scheduled and the gate was opened for boarding 30mins than what was posted. Boarding in our plan was organized and peaceful as passengers were called in with respect to their seating assignments. The aircraft turnaround time was quick and methodical. Our flight to Puerto Princesa began with no incident and we landed safely in the new Puerto Princesa Airport 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Overall the flight was simple and straightforward like any one hour domestic flight should be.",,,,,
"  Manila to Cebu. Delayed. Unfriendly staff. We were transferred from one plane to another. Our baggage arrived earlier than us, we end up in Cebu looking for our baggage and we do not know where to find it took us 3hrs before we got our baggage.  The staff shouted on us and said that we are not paying attention when our names were called!",,,,,
"  Manila to Caticlan. AirAsia Philippines is the most disappointing airline. Our flight going from Manila to Caticlan was delayed for 3 hours. Which meant we had to wait in the airport for 6 hours altogether. When we actually got on the plane we waited for a further hour until moving. The crew was apologetic however they were giving different reasons as to why we were being delayed. One reason was that the runway wasn't free and the next was there was a problem with a machine to get the engine going. Me and my boyfriend were expecting to spend 2 and a half days of sun in Boracay, however, because of this we wasted a day off our short holiday. Despite the low fare, the waiting isn't worth it when you could get to your destination on time by spending a bit more money on a different airline.",,,,,
  I was supposed to travel AirAsia Philippines from Cebu to Manila. AirAsia Philippines changed the flight departure time from 20.10 to 23.20. No compensation and an unengaged staff that couldn't care less. Will never fly them again.,,,,,
"  Kalibo to Manila. We purchashed our tickets online prior to arriving to the country. We were surprised by the online booking fee that appears right befor paying. It was in the amount of half the actual fare per person. Once we arrived in the Philippines we received an email to inform us that our flight from Manila to Kalibo was going to be delayed.  Once we arrived to the check in counter to see if we can get on an earlier flight they were able to accommodate this. Our original flight was for 530pm. We were able to get on a 330 pm flight. We had to check in 1 baggage with a weight limit of 21kg that costed again half the cost of the flight?  Sitting around the airport we were informed that this flight will be delayed, not once, not twice, not three times. Our rescheduled flight was now 530pm.  On the way back, they decided a checked in baggage weight maximum of 10kg, so going there you are expected to drop half of what you brought? If we arrived 4 hours earlier (who does this for a domestic flight?) the fee would be cheaper. So another surprising fee. So now we are here and our flight is delayed for an hour and a half and this is the first flight of the day from Kalibo to Manila. I wonder if we are delayed 4 hours if I would get the difference back for the fee I paid to check in my 10kg luggage. I am so happy we did not bring our children on this flight, it would have been a nigtmare. Lovely staff, but why all the hidden fees and information?",,,,,
"  Manila to Tacloban was delayed for almost 3hrs, however, Air Asia was prepared by providing snacks. Tacloban to Manila was on time. Consistent on board service. Friendly cabin crew. Online booking still smooth. Keep it up. I am still happy with the overall experience.",,,,,
"  Great flight with AirAsia Philippines flying from Kalibo to Manila. Boarded the aircraft exactly 40 mins prior to departure which is extremely unlikely for it to be so efficient, especially with a budget carrier. Plane was clean, staff were great as per usual and the flight landed 25 minutes early which was even better!",,,,,
"  Check in staff at Seoul Incheon were unenthusiastic and seemed bored to be at work. My flight was rescheduled from Manila to Cebu and they reluctantly put me on the flight before as they told me to wait until I arrived in Manila but in 4.5 hours time maybe the early flight would have been full with others that had the same idea as me. Nice flight to Manila, when I arrived in Manila we were stuck on the plane for an additional 30 minutes as they couldn't connect the air bridge to the aircraft. Luckily the Manila to Cebu flight was delayed so I had an extra 25 minutes, the security staff at budget terminal 4 were unbelievably rude. The second A320 we were on to Cebu was so old. The only saving grace was the always great onboard service.",,,,,
" Manila to Kalibo with AirAsia Philippines for a Boracay visit. Being a low cost carrier and short flight we didn't expect much except being on time. On the Manila to Kalibo leg our flight was delayed by almost 2 hours with very little communication from the ground staff. We are sitting in the Kalibo departure lounge right now for our return flight to Manila. The flight should have left 30 minutes ago. Ground staff told us that it will be around 45 minutes late. AirAsia website and Flightstats however show the flight to be 105 mins late. No word from the ground staff yet. AirAsia's communication is unbelievably miserable. Their customers are forced to inform themselves about their flights departure time. And don't expect your online check-in boarding passes to be emailed or sent to your smart phone. Tried both and we are still waiting. As said before, I don't expect much, but I expect to arrive at my destination on time and be proactively informed if there are delays. AirAsia Philippines gets an F-Grade on both. Never again.",,,,,
"  I have been flying with AirAsia Philippines for a number of times, and also a member of their loyalty program. I said that because I have been used to their flights being delayed that its no longer an issue for me. This trip Manila - Cebu - Manila was no exception as both flights were delayed. However, I will still give them a better score as the other factors was generally OK. From their online booking, to their online check in, to their ground staff, to their cabin crew, all were excellent. I haven't had a bad experience from them. I just hope that they will be placed in a better airport in Manila, this is not their fault.",,,,,
" Cebu to Manila with AirAsia. The positive thing is that they are very affordable especially when you book a week before and all the flights have become quite pricey. The downside is that more often than not, you get what you pay for in terms of quality and service. As I was boarding back to Manila the gate staff were extremely rude and unpleasant. They tore my boarding pass carelessly without a bit of finesse. When I passed they abruptly went after me and rudely said that they had to weigh my bag. They weighed it and it exceeded 1 kilo more than the allotted 7kg. I brought the same things I did when I came to Cebu last week so I was surprised, but they demanded I pay. Luckily I have someone with me who’s carrying less than 4 kg worth so they got my excess 1kg but the staff were extremely angry and unpleasant. It made my flight tense and uncomfortable. The plane was half empty by the way. Staff were so crass and unrefined for the hospitality business. I understand that for a low-fare airline we get what we pay for but I don’t think it should come with cheap staff and cheaper service. Truthfully, AirAsia is a big help to a lot of people and travellers, but would it hurt to treat them with respect?",,,,,
"  Manila to Tacloban with AirAsia Philippines. First problems with the check in, the day befor we traveled from Copenhagen to Manila we had 2 bags with 25 kilos each, but when we check in the next day there is 8 kilos too much and we didn't add anything? And they told us the flight is delayed about 3 hours because of problems with the runway.  It was around 5 hours delay in the end and we didn't get any food or water the first 4 hours form AirAsia. Just a lot of bad excuses so they don't have to do anything. ",,,,,
"Our flight from Manila to Hong Kong from NAIA Terminal 3 was delayed by an hour. Our flight was supposed to be at 6:15pm and they delayed it by 2 hours (8:15pm). At the time, that was tolerable. But going back, they delayed our 6:50pm flight and already told us before the day that they delayed our flight again for 2 hours (8:15pm). Then today, they delayed it for almost 3 hours (10:50pm).  We've been at the airport since 4.45pm. I don't think I want to fly AirAsia ever again.",,,,,
Flight from Kalibo was delayed 8 hours. Arrived in Seoul at midnight when the rail system is shut down. A bus provided to Seoul Station but this is useless as only a hotel is helpful now. Requested hotel but was denied. No remuneration or anything for 8 hour delay. Planes don't even have a flap on the back of seat to put your water.,,,,,
" Love the 2-3-2 seat configuration. Super clean aircraft and friendly efficient service you come to expect from AirAisia. Great prices, even with two checked bags to avoid excess baggage fees - it is worth it.",,,,,
"  Do not fly this airline for a business trip! They lure you into booking a business class flight with a lie flat bed only to end up with a budget airline economy seat after changing the aircraft last minute. To be fair they offer a full refund or change of flight at no cost but what does it help you if you have connecting flights booked and meetings scheduled for the next day? I know it happens that aircraft need to be changed sometimes but they don't have sufficient aircraft to at least cater for their business class passengers and you end up in a budget airline economy seat. So if you have to travel for business, stay away from Air Asia, it is not worth it.",,,,,
" I booked extra baggage for the wrong trip, once you booked it, you can't change it from going flight to the return flight. I tried to call them multiple times but couldn't get to the customer service. I had to purchase baggage later on for a lot extra and I had extra 5kg. She asked for 260 MYR but I refused then I had to empty my bags at the airport, the back and forth caused unnecessary delays of 1 hour to us because of their stupid booking app that I used which made me book the 2 bags on one way. I ended up wearing 3 layers in the middle of the heat in KLIA2. They will not see a cent from me, they have some of the most uncomfortable seats among airlines. Overall when you book cheap airlines you'll get cheap service, for me as a budget traveller, I just went with them.",,,,,
  I booked a flight with AirAsia from BKK to SYD in October for a Jan flight however a month later they cancelled the flight for a 10 day trip and gave me a new flight 6 days later than booked. The event i was going to would have finished by that time so i cancelled the flight and Airasia agreed to refund me on 18th Nov 2022. Some 4.5 months later there is no refund. Online it is a case in progress and a refund will be forthcoming? However they manage to take the money immediately on booking and after agreeing a refund nothing has happened after 4 1/2 months. There are no contact details and the only communication is through a unhelpful and useless Chat Bot. There is no human interaction or anyone to contact which leaves you very frustrated. I have flown with this airline several times pre Covid and been satisfied. Now this airline is uncontactable and the delay is refunding me is annoying and the delay is unreasonable.,,,,,
"  Flight D7532 25th of March 2023 I booked premium with meals from Osaka to KL and then to Kota Kinabalu return for my work. Before departure I was emailed with notice that a change of aircraft had occurred. So before leaving KL to go to Kota Kinabalu I reconfirmed with AirAsia staff at KL that I had a seat in premium for the 7 hour return journey to Osaka and that my meal had been booked. The ground staff at KL assured me this was correct. However, on my return journey from KL to Osaka I was directed to an economy seat. When I complained that my work had paid for a premium seat I was ignored by cabin staff, then a staff said he would contact the ground crew and then an English speaking cabin staff said that I could ask for a refund. I told her I didn’t want a refund as I don’t want to spend 7 hours in cramped conditions. She then said I would be removed from the plane if I didn’t sit down, so I had no choice but to return to the economy seat. When I returned to my seat someone else had taken it as they wanted to sit next to their friend. This then resulted in meal confusion.  There was no soap in the toilet I used. ",,,,,
  I paid extra to get a quiet zone seat but they downgraded passengers to economy because they changed plane. No notice. I paid extra so I can get aisle but shoved in the middle. And they make make it impossible to ask for refund at the airport as they do not have physical counter at our airport. I know it is budget airline but at least give people the seat one paid for.,,,,,
"  My flights had been cancelled and rescheduled with short notice. The customer service is a bot that isn’t helpful with your needs and when you do speak to someone it is hard to communicate in English. If you don’t book baggage it’s $60 for 15kgs and around $20 for every 1kg over. If I book my luggage earlier it’s 20kg for below $60. The lineups for check in were endless. So far when speaking to someone from AirAsia at the airport, they have been nice and helpful though. No tv’s for longer flights.",,,,,
"  We flew AIr Asia D7213 with 5 adults and an infant on Friday 13/1/2023 and checked in a baby stroller which was collected by ground staff at departure gate just before boarding at 3pm. Upon arrival at KLIA2, the stroller had gone missing and ground staff at Ground Team Red were incredibly unhelpful. We were told to complete the appropriate property irregularity report and left forwarding address for the stroller to be send if found. It has been 5 days and we have not heard from Ground Team Red and was unable to contact them. Meanwhile we have to purchase another stroller for use in Malaysia.",,,,,
" AirAsia IS NOT READY to carry passengers after COVID hiatus! They sell you a 5am flight, but claim it leaves at 11pm, then on the day of departure you get a nasty SMS that ""your flight was re-scheduled from 11pm to 5am"". Now you'd have to book an airport hotel (owned AirAsia as well), get up at 5am, just to learn that the flight is ""re-scheduled"" AGAIN, now to 6.15am. Next 7am etc. Wasting WHOLE day of your holiday to sit in the worst terminal in SE Asia (KLIA). All you get is a 20RM meal voucher that NO SHOP accepts. Nobody of the ground staff knows what's going on, claiming it's a 'medical issue', but if you check past days departure times, ALL these flights were delayed by 6-7 hours! 200 people stuck in the airport, no hotel, no food, no information. Ruined holiday for all, and AirAsia is not even apologetic. Every single person of the ground staff just points finger at each other, and nobody knows what's going on and when the flight will leave. FLY SINGAPORE OR THAI, avoid Malaysia at all cost!",,,,,
"  You pay for what you get I suppose. No in flight entertainment. No complimentary anything.., not even a cup of coffee. And worse they lost my checked bag. After I did everything they asked. Was there well above their asking time. Waited patiently in line and they STILL lost my bag on a direct flight. ",,,,,
"  Was suppose to fly at midnight, but the flight was rescheduled 4 times and is now leaving 13 hours later. Every few hours I get a notice of reschedule. I spent Rm1k to change to this date to make the wedding and I will now miss it and lose the rm1k flight change fee that I paid. Worse airline and will never fly AirAsia again. ",,,,,

" Melbourne to Taipei via Kuala Lumpur. The worst online chat that I have used. I have an AirAsia X voucher that was automatically given to me even though I wanted a full refund. When I finally went ahead to book a D7 flight as per the terms and conditions, my voucher code did not work. I read through the whole T&C and deduced that it should work. Staff could not offer any alternative and kept asking me to refer back to the terms and conditions or alter the flight date/route. The problem is not the flight, it is the voucher. He did not seem to get it. I used to love this airline, but not anymore.",,,,,
  AirAsia X cancelled my flights last April 2020. After confirming they were refunding my money in 10 weeks nothing happened. It´s 2021 and I'm still waiting for my money. ,,,,,
"  I was amazed at their decision of a no reply email sent to me after 9 months of trying for a refund to my personal account in which you had already promised me and have registered.

"  We've had to jump through so many hoops to finally get our refund. But we did finally get it, 10 months later! It should be noted the information herein would only apply to people who received a refund/credit option after flights were cancelled, not those only receiving a credit offer. Time line: 13 Nov 2019: book flights for 7 April 2020. 18 March: flights cancelled, received email from Airasia offering refund/credit options. 18 March: log in to Airasia account, open chat, select refund, informed to expect refund within 3 weeks. 22 March: Australia closes borders. 9 April: (the end of their 3 week processing time) to 8 September, multiple attempts to contact them, all fail. Chat bot completely useless, go around in circles, contact via Facebook, no call centres, no email contact, again, all designed to make it almost impossible to contact anyone there. 8 September: file chargeback claim with visa card. 10 October, chargeback rejected by Airasia, conveniently 2 days after the validity time of the claim, thus no possibility to have the claim re-examined by card provider. 12 October: File complaint with our local consumer protection agency. 12 October: Consumer protection contacts Airasia, they obviously have an email address for a real person, unlike the rest of us who have only Aisasia chat bot contact. 13 October: Airasia requests bank account details for refund, with the same processing time frame of 3 weeks. 12 November (4 weeks later) refund received.

"  Denpasar to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur. I paid for my ticket, 6 days later the flight is cancelled, there are no available flights for a month. 3 other carriers are going my route. Airasia refuse to refund the ticket. Insisting I take credit for flights not even available. We all understand that flying during Covid 19 is difficulty. This policy is shameful if you cannot carry the passenger return the payment. To contact AirAsia you have to use a robot called Ava or social media. Ava put me in a 3 hour queue where I have to watch the screen was there is a 60 second window to get access. It took me 10 hours to be watching at the right time then the result is no help or refund Alternatively you can use social media, my DM on Twitter to support is idling in the their box for 48 hours with no response. I recommend that passengers be very early of AirAsia at this time they post non existent flights then take your money and keep it.",,,,,
"  I booked a round trip ticket from Australia to Sri Lanka in December 2019. I was due to departure on 26.03.2020. I was informed on 22.03.2020 by E mail that my departure flight is canceled. I understand that cancellations are unavoidable due to the prevailing situation. I received a generic E-mail that AirAsia will refund our money (though they encourage us to get the credit). This was two weeks ago and I am still unable to submit my claim. I am disgusted with the process of submitting my claim through the AVA (virtual assistance service). I have tried to submit my refund request, as instructed by them. There AVA is a nightmare. I have spent hours and I am going in circles for the last two weeks. They do not have an Australian address, telephone or e-mail to contact them.",,,,,
" Bangkok to Fukuoka. AirAsia has the worst customer support ever. I could not be able to reach them and been trying multiple days already. The only way to contact them is through website chat, which is a not so smart bot first if it cannot handle your request and try to send you to another link, that's where I have been wait forever. No email inquiry and no phone. The 24hour support is totally scam.",,,,,
"  Our family of five (2 adults & 3 kids, aged 12, 11 & 7) recently flew Air Asia from Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne. Air Asia ""auto assigned"" seats at online check-in that separated our group, which placed our 7 year old seven rows behind the rest of the family even though there were plenty of seats of 5 together on the flight, leaving us no option but to purchase seats. Also, we hired their tablets for entertainment but one didn't work. The cabin crew advised us to contact their customer support who weren't interested.",,,,,
  Taipei to Kuala Lumpur. Flight departed and arrived on time.

Meal service was rather slow as it took a long time before anyone passed by for me to order some food. Cabin crew were hit & miss - Some were professional while some looked like they would rather be anywhere but serving customers on a plane.,,,,,
  Traveled from Kuala Lumpur to Chitose on Air Asia. It was an overnight flight. I found it a comfortable flight. Check in was easy and was able to relax when on board getting a window seat automatically allocated. I believe I had a spare seat next to me so I was comfortable. I will fly them again.,,,,,
 I traveled from Kuala Lumpur to the Gold Coast on a rather full Air Asia X flight. I was able to sleep a little bit on the flight. I will fly them again.,,,,,
  Kuala Lumpur to Sydney. I want to commend two cabin staff that were wonderful ambassadors on my flight back from Kuala Lumpur to Sydney on 24 November 2019. Their names are Krijana and Bina. They were the two most hardworking members of staff on that flight and the patience and courtesy displayed by them made my flight comfortable and enjoyable. They were friendly and patient and served passengers with a smile. I will fly Air Asia anytime as long as you have staff like these two young ladies.,,,,,
"  Perth to Denpasar via Lombok. It puzzles me that I can fly by AirAsia internationally and carry 23 kg then have to dump 8kg if my connecting flight is domestic with them. Where was I to put this, in the extra bag of course that I did not have. So at Rp100000+ per kilo excess that's an easy profit for them. ",,,,,
  Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur. I request for an aisle seat in the middle row. They say it is a full flight and I need to pay for an aisle seat in the quiet zone. I found out there were empty seats on this flight. I feel cheated.,,,,,
  Children under 5 in a sleeper cabin? Fortunately the mother was very attentive to her children's needs however the half dozen times they did get upset and cry was enough to wake us each time rendering the choice of a sleeper cabin redundant and had we been informed of this we would have chosen a ‘hot seat’ saving 600 each. Also attitude of attendants was the worst we have experienced. ,,,,,
  Osaka to Bangkok. Very adequate service throughout for a budget airline. Food small portions but tasty. Plenty of toilets and room to walk about. Nice clean aircraft left a little late but arrived early.,,,,,
  Kuala Lumpur to Perth. On October 9th My husband and myself boarding on flight D7 239 at KL airport ready to come home to Perth. Our flight before was delayed so we had to rush to this flight at 11.25pm so that the plane could leave at 12:05am. During this time we had no time to get anything to eat at the airport as the boarding gates were already open for us to get on to our flight so we just figured we would order food and drinks on the flight. We got on the flight and asked if we could get a movie package to which they said yes. When it came to paying for some entertainment and food and drinks the lady would not accept our debit mastercard as that was all we had for payment. So for 5 hours we were hungry and thirsty with not even water to drink. Next time we will pay extra money to fly with a better and more efficient flying company.,,,,,
"  Kuala Lumpur to Fukuoka. A refurbished older plane, boarding is quick with a full flight, crew was showing restlessly eager and impertinent at this midnight red-eye flight. Crew disappear after meal service. Dark mode cabin for passenger to rest. The Korean Sweet and Spicy Chicken (Dakgangjeong) prebook meal is hard and cold and seat 29K the seat pitch is not satisfying. Thanks to the tailwind we land early.",,,,,
"  Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur. The plane was delayed by 20 minutes because they were waiting for a passenger. I have never heard of this happening before. On the way back to Melbourne I was sitting in the hot seat which is positioned just at the back of premium class. The hot seat is in the quiet zone where there are supposed to be no babies, however there was a baby in premium class who was crying much of the time. I paid extra to sit in this area and did not get what I paid for.",,,,,
  Gold Coast to Kuala Lumpur was an eight hour flight. Boarding was orderly. Announcements were few. It was a bit cramped in my row. I had a meal which was nice. I will fly them again as they do great job.,,,,,
"  Phuket to Melbourne via Kualar Lumpur. Barely existent customer service and their seats are so cramped making a long haul flight a nightmare. The lights are on for a good chunk of the flight making it difficult to get any shut-eye. They have a nonsensical policy that phones must be ""turned off"" for takeoff and landing - not switched to flight mode, but turned off - and they enforce it. Prior to booking, there was an issue with the booking and trying to speak to their customer service left me fuming. Their Australian contact number was engaged on the 10+ times I tried to call it. To chat with them online you have to get past their online bot which is a real pain when it doesn't understand your problem. The person I spoke to was absolutely rude and unhelpful. The chat closes after 60 seconds of inactivity which is infuriating when you have to go off and find information. ",,,,,
" Bangkok Don Mueang to Osaka with AirAsiaX. Delay after constant delay. Even boarding the plane is delayed by half an hour. The motto of this company should be ""never on time"". Horrible experience, not even counting the nickle and diming.",,,,,
"  Kuala Lumpur to Gold Coast return. The outgoing flight was okay, as a night flight there was nothing much to do but try to sleep. The return flight was a day flight which leaves OOL at 1035am. The crew on D7 201 from OOL to KUL on 6th July 2019 were the best airline crew I have ever encountered in about 40 years of flying! They were polite, pleasant, engaging and nothing seemed like too much trouble for them. I was just overwhelmed by their service and grace. Well done to Air Asia. The downside is that their seats are awful, they fit an extra seat into the A330 economy section which means 3-3-3 abreast instead of 2-4-2 in most other airlines. The seat width is terrible, aisles are very narrow but the seat pitch is okay. The food was good, plenty available for purchase on the way out but they seemed to run out of many things on the return flight to KL. The ground staff at KLIA2 are awful. The seem so ineffectual and when boarding, there was no announcement over the loudspeaker so everyone just got up to board, ignoring the families with kids and older people. They need to sort out their boarding procedures in KLIA2. The ground staff at OOL are a little brusque and in particular, a rude lady who was on the plane prior to departure. She snapped at passengers as the crew wanted to do a head count and some people were still standing to adjust their luggage in the overhead bins. I would fly them again just for the crew.",,,,,
"  Beijing to Kuala Lumpur. Most uncomfortable flight I've been on. The cabin was freezing. As a low-cost airline, a blanket had to be paid for and water also cost extra. Meals were provided to those who reserved in advance or buy onboard. No in flight entertainment, no place to charge electronics. The seats were hard and ramrod straight.  I will not ever be flying this airline again.",,,,,
"  Red eye flight from Kuala Lumpur to Perth on 17 April. The flight leaves at 0005 and arrives into Perth at 0530. Boarding was shambolic as there was one lady in charge up front and she spoke fast and her speech was so unclear that nobody understood her and everyone just got up and boarded anyway. It was storming before takeoff so we waited on the tarmac after boarding in the middle of a thunderstorm. The flat seat was comfortable and they provide a duvet and a large pillow for sleep. You are given a small complimentary bottle of water and a tablet with noise cancelling headphones. The tablet is loaded with a limited number of movies and TV shows and lasts about 4 hours. I don't understand why they serve you food at 0030 (I was not given a choice, just handed a tray of food) after takeoff instead of serving it before landing. The cabin crew were very professional and pleasant but boarding announcements were appalling as the purser was a Japanese man and although no fault of his, his accent could not be understood by virtually anyone on the aircraft. Quizzical looks all around! All in all, they were punctual, efficient and pleasant. One drawback. They turn on the lights about an hour before landing when we easily could have had an extra 30 minutes of sleep. Points to improve: your staff need elocution lessons on clear speech.",,,,,
"  Our return flight from Langkawi to Avalon through Kuala Lumpur started with a flight time change, originally departing at 6pm our plane was re-scheduled to 7:55pm. As we proceeded through the gate to the tarmac (Premium Flex) we were instructed to wait at the stairs as there were 2 elderly people in wheelchairs who needed to board via the lift system. After some time we were then told to board through the back of the plane. After approaching the rear stairs we were then waved back by the pilot to the front. We ended up being one of the last to board seated in 1B and 1C, boarding was totally disorganized. A further delay due to this meant we arrived even later to KL airport, however we proceeded through customs before anyone and made our way to our connecting flight. With 2 x Premium Hot Seats we were able to navigate our way onto the next flight with little issue. On arrival into Avalon we were once again through customs quite quickly as we were able to exit the plane first. However our luggage didn't arrive. How was it that no-one in KL was able to ascertain that our luggage didn't make the flight? They had 8 hours to call ahead, actually 9 hours seeing we waited over an hour for our luggage. What disappoints me is the treatment from the staff and total lack of communication from AirAsia. You cannot contact AirAsia in Australia, teir Sydney number goes back to KL. We never received a call, text or email from AirAsia X. We left all our details at the airport for them to contact them. But the saga continues. After multiple emails to KL I found out that our bags were placed on 2 different flights. One later in the day and the other one the next morning. The bags arrived on separate flights and were separates in the lost luggage area of Avalon Airport, one even included a large hand written note saying ""Waiting for other bag arriving on D7 218"". The bags continued to sit there separated for a further 24 hours, still no call, email or text. Ringing KL they said the bags were there but yet once again you can't call ANYONE in Australia. Instead they give you the number for AVALON, which welcomes you with ""Welcome to Jetstar"" and had no reference to AirAsia. It was only though the assistance of a lady at Avalon Administration who knew the Air Asia supervisor that a direct call was made. Finally my bags were reunited and given to a courier at 7:30pm 3 days after departure. I was told they would be with me by 8:30pm. At 9:30pm I received a call from the courier saying he won't be coming until tomorrow as he'd also had to go to Geelong. I stood my ground, told them they had destroyed my evening and had no choice but to bring me my bags. Finally I received them at 11:30pm that night. Close to a week has past and I still have not received a call, text, email or apology from Air Asia.",,,,,
  Kuala Lumpur to Sydney. Why bother with self service to speed up the process to then have only 2 counters for document verification? The queue is long and slow. If you have done so much to speed things up why let this final process to taint the effectiveness and efficiency? I always fly AirAsia. It is economy airline and they have done well on a lot of fronts and to come this far itself is an amazing achievement. I am just very curious why this decision and this process?,,,,,
"  Flying from Bangkok to Tokyo. Plane left as scheduled, arrived on time in tokyo Narita. Very friendly inflight staff, and good ground staff as well. Nothing particular on the flight itself, no free food, no inflight entertainment, it's a low cost airline. I felt cold in this flight and I suspect the airline to lower the temperature inside the plane to make you buy there cover, so just prepare a small jacket and that will be fine. Seats are okay, better than short flight budget airline.",,,,,
"  Flying from Seoul Incheon to Bangkok. Well, was not too bad at all. Plane was on time, arrived in Bangkok a little bit early, thanks to good wind I suppose, inflight staff member were really nice and smiling. On the other hand, there is the lack of inflight entertainment, but with some movies on my PC it was ok, and no free food. I bought some snacks before taking the plane and it was enough. But I suspect the airline to lower the temperature inside the plane so you will have buy them some cover. I felt really cold compared to many other airline I took...fortunately I had a jacket with me.",,,,,
"  Bangkok to Auckland via Kuala Lumpur. Fantastic value for money especially when one finds a promo or random very low fair. The food was good and very cheap too as well as the beer. Bought a warm meal for under €5 and beer was around €3. Will be flying this airline over the major carriers when possible, after all what do you miss out on, free food and drink and an entertainment screen? Seats are a little cramped but not enough to grumble about really. The layover in Gold Coast is an annoying factor in this leg though. Not once were my carry-on bags checked for weight so could have easily packed more in my luggage.",,,,,
" Tokyo Haneda to Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia X. Flight departed and landed on time. Did not pre-book a seat and was allocated a middle seat, which was not comfortable to say the least. Cabin crew were a little slow in starting meal service and hence I had to wait some time before I could purchase a drink. Was an overnight flight so largely napped for most of the time.",,,,,
"  Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo Haneda. Flight departed on time & arrived early, although was forced to wait on the tarmac as parking Bay was occupied by another aircraft. Was randomly allocated a seat in the Quiet Zone, a welcome stroke of luck. Pre-booked an onboard meal, chicken Teriyaki rice, which was pretty decent. Flight attendants were professional & polite, and the captain was clear & prompt in his announcements. Overall a satisfactory flight.",,,,,
"  Seoul Incheon to Kuala Lumpur. The check in counter only opened 2 hours before flight and the queue to check in was so long. There were no self check in kiosk. We were in the airport 5 hours before flight. We were in a rush to catch up the flight as we had to take train to the gate. After we boarded the aircraft and put our luggage in the compartment, the aircraft was out of power due to problems with Ground Power Unit(GPU). The pilot did an announcement regarding it but no estimation time given. Passengers were still boarding at this time with limited light and small aisle. It’s really not worth it to pay for hot seats and having to face awful stuff. But kudos to one of the cabin crew on the flight who  saw me having difficulties dealing with crying babies and changed my seat after take-off. ",,,,,
  Denpasar to Auckland via Kuala Lumpur. The seat was not confortable and the leg room was so small. Definitely it is not recommended to travel with AirAsia X for a journey more than 2 hours. Entertainment system was not available on board.  The flight attendants are getting better. ,,,,,
"  We bought return tickets in early March 2018, flying from Kuala Lumpur to Osaka in end October 2018. There were 2 cancellations made by AirAsia without notice. Both had no notice or email given until we noticed the changes ourselves when we were surfing the website to purchase add-on. The 1st cancellation was made somewhere in June to early July, original flight to Osaka cancelled and they moved it to 2 days later than the original. We filed complaints through email and Twitter, and expressed our dissatisfaction on the cancellation and changes without notice immediately, and request for flight change as the date is not preferable. Entitled for free reschedule, we moved the date to early November. The 2nd cancellation was made soon after the reschedule done in early July till early August, same scenario as previous, no notification! We noticed the changes ourselves in the website, filed another complaint through Twitter, and the only thing we can do is either get a refund or free reschedule. Nothing else. Noticed there were complaints about the delays and difficulties in getting the refund from Airasia, we decided to make another flight reschedule to late November. Our departure flight now is 2am on 24 November (tomorrow). And this early morning (today) we received an email informing us that there will be a delay in our flight for 2 hours. We are now so frustrated and yet worried there will be another delay in the flight later. Another note, the response from Airasia's customer care or support team is very disappointing. Response received from Twitter somewhat acceptable, which they took about 5 hours to 1 day to reply, but as long as you have decided the date to reschedule to, they somehow managed to get it done quickly. However, there was no response from our email complaints about the first cancellation that we made in mid-July, until end-August where we have already made our second reschedule (in mid-August) after the second cancellation without notice. And the email was only reflecting the first cancellation and first reschedule that we made in July. Soon after the email, Cancellation Notice was sent to my inbox to notify the first cancellation, after 2 months, and it wasn't even valid at that time anymore.",,,,,
  Amritsar to New Chitose via Kuala Lumpur. Very happy with the 2 flights I had with AirAsia X. Flights were on time. Staff were friendly. Very reasonable price. Seats are comfortable and leg room is sufficient.,,,,,
"  Kuala Lumpur to Sydney on low-fare ticket. Service was manic and disorganised, often bordering on rude. For an 8 hour flight I wasn't offered a free glass of water. Essentially they know you're going to pay. Emailed them with some feedback and took them more than 6 weeks to reply. Pay the extra and fly with an airline that actually has some thought about their passenger.",,,,,
"  We bought return air tickets from AirAsia X for travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Sapporo-Shin-Chitose  on last Sunday (9 Sep) and return on 17 Sep. A strong earthquake hit Hokkaido on September 6, damaged buildings and infrastructure, airport and caused many landslides, airport closure and power outages, AirAsia published an announcement on their website news room later on the same day for the service recovery options for guests traveling on these flights from 8 - 11 September. We were afraid most hotels, restaurants, and shops would remained closed, we decided to retain the value of our booking in AirAsia BIG Loyalty account. We monitored our mailbox and SMS closely but never receive an email from AirAsia for so called service recovery option. We called multiple calls to AirAsia Malaysia call centre and tried to reach to their customer support via LiveChat, Twitter, Facebook, and even wrote to them and completed e-form several times since 8 Sep till today 12 Sep. All methods we have tried but not hearing a word from them. We did not take flight but we did not get refund in any form. We bought value packs which includes standard seat selection. However, I noticed AirAsia is charging us the seats when we tried to select standard seats on the website after the booking is confirmed. Even we tried to get hot seats, the initial seats are not refund. There are many unhappy, frustrated customers like us.",,,,,
"  Colombo to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur. My wife and I have travelled from Sydney to Trichy in July. I purchased the baggage for 25kg each but the actual weight was only 15kg each. The airline said that they cannot downgrade the allowance once it is paid. When we came back from Colombo to Sydney in August, we got 6kg over weight. Therefore I have tried to increase the allowance from 25kg to 30kg for each. I have spent about 5 hours in my phone and several attempts to increase the allowance, but the Airasia system did not allow me to do so. Although it is their system issue, I was charged for the extra luggage at very high rate at the Colombo airport and I was advised to get the refund at KLIA. The customer service person at the KLIA advise me to try the telephone customer support team. The telephone customer support team asked me to fill an eForm to get the refund. But the airline has treated me with suspicious instead of investigating the failure of their system. I have only requested the refund of surcharge fee at the airport (i.e. difference between the online fee and the airport fee for the additional luggage). ",,,,,
"  Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne. Upgraded to flatbed only to be advised on boarding that the seats were double booked and sent back to cramped seats with no leg room. Advised I need to request them to investigate via e-form to get my monies returned. Told the investigation may take a week or so and then only if approved I will get my money back for a service they never supplied. So far its cost me $800.00 for nothing. Not sure if they will refund or not.  Thought I would give them another chance this time, what a mistake that was. ",,,,,
"  I've flied with AirAsia many times, the seats are quite cramped and everything costs extra but the prices are very cheap when booked in advance. However at Kuala Lumpur (Klia2) airport I got lost and had a lot of luggage so I had to use the lifts which would only take me up one floor at the time - it took me ages to get to Departures. I was able to check in at the Self check in machines and I even got my luggage tags but when I arrived at the Baggage drop 5 min later, the staff said that she can't accept my bags anymore (the flight was leaving in 55 min). I went to complain to the Customer Service desk and the staff was very unhelpful and rude couldn't care less that I was going to miss a flight because of a few minutes error. I asked about different options and they only offered to ""change"" my flight for next day which would have cost me AUD 960 - I had paid AUD 160 for my flight. I ended up sleeping at the airport and taking another flight next morning through Bali with another company which was a little cheaper than the option that they had offered me.",,,,,
"  Gold Coast to Kuala Lumpur. A male aircrew who had served me at the same flight made my worth experience with AirAsia X. I was kind of in panic at that time under strange surroundings and my bad condition with long journey. However, I was impressed when he asked me ‘may I help you?’ at totally out of his field and he took care me till I could go to my stay safely, more than 2h. As a person who does customer service too, I was more grateful that I can understand it is hard to do after hard-working. Doing so, even though I cannot really remember his name, I want to say thank you to him by this review. The moment inflight was not bad, it was right there what I expected. Nevertheless, his service- mind changed my mind to head to AirAsia again.",,,,,
"  I recently had a flight from Sydney to New Delhi with a 1 hour 15 minute layover in Kuala Lumpur. Apprehensive about the layover, I called Air Asia customer care to check what happens if I miss my flight and I was assured that if the first flight is delayed, the connecting will also be delayed and I will not miss my flight to New Delhi. But I did miss my flight thanks to an hour long delay in Sydney. I was then asked to either stay at the airport for 5 days (I didn't have a Malaysian visa since it was transit only) or fly to another city in India and of course I picked the latter. But then I had to book another flight for myself early in the morning at for 2am to get to my home city with exorbitant charges. They refused to compensate in any way.",,,,,
"  I have always been a regular traveler for Air Asia since it started year during the late 90's. And thanks to Air Asia, I had been to many countries that I had never thought I would be going. This May 2018 I'm flying for the first time to Shanghai via Kuala Lumpur from Miri. My flight was suppose to be 5:30pm but it was delayed until 8pm, and my connection flight was 11:30pm from Kuala Lumpur to Shanghai. The time I arrived Kuala Lumpur it's already 10:45pm and I have to run like crazy person in order to get to my departure gate. The seat was not comfortable for the 5 hours flight, but I had flown before more than 5 hours, so, I have to accept the seat was meant to be like this, and I just need to find my own way to have a good rest. I would say the best part of the flight was the food actually, which I pre-ordered and I really enjoy the meal. I like also the interaction between the Cabin Crew with the passengers. I would definitely fly again and again. As long as the price is affordable, and the food is good!",,,,,
  Melbourne to Phuket via Kuala Lumpur. Just want to say we were pleasantly surprised. We had not flown Air Asia before but the cabin crew and a special mention to Joyce who was very friendly consistently smiling throughout the 8 hour flight and helpful.,,,,,
  On 22nd June I fly on AirAsia from Kuala Lumpur to the Gold Coast. I had to do a document check and it was carried very efficiently. Lots to do in the airport so my transit did not seem that long. Boarding was smooth with extra check taking place to ask security questions. At KUL you stay in the gate area until they open the gangway. I had seat 48C an isle which was comfortable and easy to go to the bathroom. I like AirAsia and I will fly them again.,,,,,
"  Fabulous flights with AirAsia X yet again. Both long flights were overnighters so the lie flat beds are brilliant. Service was excellent as was the food. First two flights on time but coming home half an hour delay from Phuket to KL & then the flight into Gold Coast was half an hour late arriving too but, very minimal. Didn't use the entertainment. Just slept & read. Just brilliant that these Premium/Business class flights are affordable even by us. Could never afford it with a full service airline.",,,,,
"  Honolulu to Osaka. When booking I paid for 2 checked bags at 30 dollars a piece, not bad. When returning we had extra bags which needed to be checked but we had not pre-paid for this. At the airport, they demanded a counter fee for checking in at $123 dollars a piece! This is extortion. 4 times the price because you did not check a box online? It was not just me that dealt with this as no less than 10 passengers around us were irate with the same issue. ",,,,,
  Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne. I enjoyed the flight. It included the use of the Air Asia Lounge at KLIA2 which was a nice surprise. Check in was efficient and friendly and the plane left on time. The pre purchased food they served was very tasty. Much better then Jetstar. It was a pity they couldn't offer a choice of a continental breakfast in the morning including cereal and juice although I was happy with Nasi Lemak. IFE was not worth the trouble. Very limited music and films. The quality of sound was poor as well. I was also amazed that it was only possible to by 3 cans of Tiger Beer! It was not possible to purchase one only. Not a sensible decision.,,,,,
  Gold Coast to Kuala Lumpur. No inflight entertainment. Seats are rock hard and sit too upright. Absolutely freezing so make sure you bring a coat as they charge you for a blanket. They entice you into a flight with great prices to realise they charge extra for everything a full service airline give you as standard.,,,,,
" I was very skeptical about this, as people had informed me that the flight gets delayed, they cancel the flights often due xyz reasons, but I took a shot and booked two way tickets with meals and checkin baggage as an add-on. I travelled Economy. Web Check In Process: Seat Selection automatic, and three step check in, even if you have not purchased baggage, meals at the time of purchasing the ticket, it can be done at the time of web check in, at the same cost. The Meals served were of the best quality, quantity and taste and value for money. Pre-booking a meal saves you 45% of what you pay for the same on board. Yes water is chargeable on these flights, do carry your own water bottle. The seats for the AirAsia X flights have ample leg space and are good enough for an 8 to 9 hour journey. Staff are courteous and very well groomed, no complaints from that side, very pleasant people. Inflight entertainment has to be carried on your own, ipads, laptops as seats dont have screens, but for the price we pay for ticket I have no regrets. The flight infrastructure from the interior is good, even the toilets are always clean. So except for the water part which was a surprise to me, paying 3 Ringgits for 300 ML Water, approx rupees was a bit disappointing. The rest was a pleasurable experience.",,,,,
  Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City via Kuala Lumpur. Fantastic flight to KL. I had recently broken my toe and was an Economy passenger. The help and consideration I received was outstanding and my thanks and appreciation to the staff on that flight. I have never flown AirAsia before and I must say I had low expectations of this budget airline but I was pleasantly surprised indeed. Many thanks for ensuring I had a comfortable flight. I will definitely fly AirAsia again!,,,,,
" On the 15th December 2017 I travelled from Pattaya, Thailand to Jakarta, Indonesia on Air Asia. I had to change in Kuala Lumpur for my second and connecting flight. The connection was bearable. The service on board was pleasant. We arrived very early in the morning in Jakarta so I had to sleep for a few hours before catching a local bus to Jakarta City. I always try and fly Air Asia.",,,,,
"  I travelled AirAsia X from Osaka to Honolulu on the 2nd February 2018. I booked in economy for the seven hour flight, I ordered a chicken meal in advance which was given to someone else sitting in front of me even though they had seen my boarding pass a minute or two before. I made a protest and got my meal back slightly opened, but not eaten. All around a reasonable flight. I will fly AirAsia X again.",,,,,
"  Tokyo to Denpasar Bali. The worst flight we’ve ever had. We are on our honeymoon and had to pay the equivalent of $100 for each bag (two 8kg backpacking bags). When we sat on the plane, we were not together. The plane was almost empty - we asked to switch and they hesitated and then told us a specific area we could sit in. Why wouldn’t the check in counter seat us together? We had prebooked our seats, but that didn’t matter. No water or tea service is served free. We bought one small meal and couldn’t afford anything else. The toilet was out of soap and paper towel. Honestly all of that would have been fine if it wasn’t for the $200 charge for bags and not being able to get free water.",,,,,
  Sydney to Delhi via Kuala Lumpur. I got a great price on the premium flatbed and decided to try it. The seat is an angled flatbed but was remarkably comfortable and I managed to get a good few hours sleep. You also get an Ipad with entertainment and a meal but you have to pay for drinks. The crew were really friendly and efficient. For a budget airline they did a great job. I was surprised at how good the journey was for a 15 hour trip and I didn't feel at all tired when I arrived. ,,,,,
" Beijing to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur. Will avoid this airline like a plague in the future. I lately thought it was ok to fly with AirAsia and quickly realised it was not the case. The phone customer service was friendly but the ground and inflight staff have horrible attitudes. Just because you are budget airline, you are not being paid to be rude and treat customers like low class citizens. My stupidity led me to fly long haul where I was assigned a seat right at the back of the plane. For $100-200 I should have chosen another airlines. Lesson learned the hard way.",,,,,
"  Osaka to Honolulu. Flight was so full, some of the attendant is rushed, impatient and surly, while it was fun chatting beside galley while it last. The prebooked meal for bento was delicious but selection choice should be more varied. The cabin is hot mostly.",,,,,
"  Osaka to Kuala Lumpur. After checking in online I'd still have to queue for a long time to drop my bag. Also, what's the point of having mobile apps if the mobile app doesn't even work? I can't even view my boarding pass there and the apps keeps shutting down.",,,,,
"  Kuala Lumpur to Gold Coast. My pre-book meal delivered without any mistakes. Food is acceptable , clean and tidy. Staff are very polite professional. When fasten seat belt sign come, They follow strict rules. Toilets are kept clean throughout the journey. Must better than some full paid airlines. There are no television which is good you can sleep without disturbances. Well worth for the money.",,,,,
"  Lovely flight from Kuala Lumpur to Osaka with AirAsia X. Plane was on time and clean, staff were really friendly, plenty of food and purchase food options although they had run out of ice-creams. Return flight issue was that on-line check in was not working, see picture which meant I had to pay for additional luggage even though we had already paid for 3 bags on the first leg because we only used 1 bag on that leg we still had to pay £45 extra. The guy at check in could not waive this fee even though he understood our issue but he moved us to extra leg room seats as a compensation. Good total price paid and both airports are excellent so will definitely use this route again.",,,,,
" My mother and I were really excited to be flying with AirAsia X as it was considered the best low cost airline. However, our flight from the beginning until the end was a disappointing experience. To begin with, the ground staff didn't even greet us with a smile as if she was mad whilst doing her job. Then we realised our seats weren't together so we asked, and she rudely told us that we had to pay extra to be seated next to each other (we don't mind paying the extra fee, by the way. But we would've appreciated it more if we were told about it nicely). Then the whole entire flight, not a single smile on the faces of the crews. One crew member, whilst doing the safety procedures sighed and made an eye roll. Thankfully, the person sitting beside my mother was really nice and was helping her out throughout the flight but overall, we were really disappointed with their service and we have experienced better service at other low cost airlines.",,,,,
"  Sydney to Bangkok via Kuala Lumpur. I resently booked a flight with AirAsia X and chose the wrong date. I straight away tried to contact AirAsia. After 1 hour in the waiting line for the live chat I was informed call again during their office hours. For the date change I was charged about the same amount as the flight itself. Plus got a flight with a 12 hour long waiting time at the airport. AirAsia X used to be one of my favorite arlines, but the customer service experience was very disappointing this time.",,,,,
  Perth to Bangkok via Kuala Lumpur. My wife and kids flew on AirAsia and we're quite delighted with the lie flat seats and service on board. It was really great. Thank you. The food though needs a little work and could be improved. On a negative though is the communication using the app. We were charged for lounge access when it should have been included in premium. It does seem the booking system makes errors with charging and I see on the return we are being charged for food when we selected that option in our fare. In essence there is a lot over double charging which I don't appreciate. I have just tried the app to complain and it says I have already completed a form yet I have not. It is a shame because it seems that are getting a lot right in the air. A pity that the systems lead to overcharging and frustration. ,,,,,
"  I have booked return tickets from Singapore to Tehran, with a transit at Kuala Lumpur. The outbound flight from Singapore to Tehran was all fine, but during the return flight I had to get out at Kuala Lumpur airport and get in again without any reason given. It wasn't a very good experience since there was a huge line and immigration checking took around 3 hours, not mentioning the visa on arrival costed extra. Until now, no staff has given me a valid reason.",,,,,
"  Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh City via Kuala LumpurWe try to fly on a budget, and we have flown on various airlines. I have an online account with Air Asia so that I can make bookings when we fly. Now, when talking about experiences, overall, it is what it is - nothing spectacular, nothing bad. We decided to organise a small holiday for my wife's family in Vietnam, to travel to their hometown. Later, my wife decided she wanted to join in, so we made a booking for her, with Air Asia being the cheapest at the time of booking. As time progressed, my wife had gotten pregnant. So, we needed to cancel our flight.  Unfortunately, due to Air Asia's terms and conditions, we could not get our money back. Their cancellation fee was massive too. With no other choices I agreed, submitted all the paperwork required. What happened next was just a series of frustrating emails back and forth, as calling them was useless as they couldn't do anything, but would refer you to use their online system. Going through that meant 1-2 business day waits for replies. And the issue I was having was they would not give me the account credit. They said that they could only give the credit to the passenger's account, or to the person who made the payment. So my account doesn't count, because the passenger was my wife, not me. In the end, I had to make a new account, one for my wife, so they could finally give the account credit. Fine, after all the hassle, we have the credit, substantially less than what we paid. Going forward, since we can't fly as my wife is pregnant, and I need to work and save up money, that credit goes to waste. ",,,,,
"  Sydney to Kuala Lumpur. Relatively painless baggage drop and boarding process. Clean cabin although low interior lighting most of the time and toilets were messy half through an 8-hour flight. Staff were friendly, efficient and impressively firm with some guests standing up and making mobile calls when taxiing for takeoff. On board food and beverages have also improved noticeably. Overall a positive experience with this D7223 flight.",,,,,
"  Kuala Lumpur to Perth. Best low cost airline. On time departure, nice clean aircraft, excellent options in food and beverage, staff with excellent service attitude, decent pitch between seats. It was a great travel experience at a very low cost, excellent value. I will travel and recommend Air Asia anytime",,,,,
"  Flew premium flatbed from Perth to Kuala Lumpur then A320 onto U-Tapao. Premium flatbed is great. Not exactly flat and if you're 183cm tall like me your feet do hang off the end of the foot rest but a huge improvement over economy. 1 small bottle of water provided plus another with the pre-booked (included) meal. Meals are large and tasty for a budget airline. Tablet provided free with movies/TV etc but a rather limited choice. Alcohol, soft drinks and additional food can be purchased. The 2 centre seats are probably best as you do not have to clamber over people to use the restroom and row 1 they seem to have more leg room than the other seats due to the position of the bulkhead. For night flights row 2 is probably more preferable as the light from the galley can be bothersome in row 1 although it is turned off after main service. Provides complimentary access to Premium Red Lounge which is OK. Limited complimentary food and drink offerings but it's somewhere to relax. Smaller planes do not have flatbeds (A32x) but you can sit in row 1. Booking on 1 ticket does allow ""fly-thru"" meaning luggage automatically goes to final destination and you don't need to pass through Malaysian immigration. However, sometimes this works out considerably more expensive than booking the 2 flights separately, but then you do have to pick up luggage, pass through immigration and re-check-in for next flight. I did this on my return and was a bit of a faff but did save me nearly $150 compared to ""fly-thru"" on the 1 ticket. All up for the price I paid it was very good and I would fly again in a heartbeat if prices remain competitive.",,,,,
"  Xi'an to Kuala Lumpur. It was an overnight 5 hr flight and we purchased Premium Flatbed class. The tickets included meals as a separate line item. We checked in online but were told to check in again in the airport. The check-in counter for Premium class was very slow. Once in the aircraft we had one bottle of water each next to our seats and nothing else was offered.  In flight service in general was non-existent. Flatbeds were great. It was first experience when the airline neglected to provide part of the service. Most likely, we would never fly AirAsia X again and wouldn't recommend it.",,,,,
"  Perth to Siem Reap return via Kuala Lumpur. I always fly with ear plugs in my ears and I recommend anyone who doesn't have hearing loss to consider purchase these before flying with them. There are non-prerecorded announcements occuring approximately every 45 minutes on a typical 5.5 hour flight. The volume of the announcements is set to a level that is painful and wakes you from your sleep even if you have hearing protection. The food is not bad and they run on time. But please just turn the volume down, dim the lights more and pre-record your messages so we can actually enjoy travelling on you more often.",,,,,
"  Flew AirAsia X from Sydney to Kuala Lumpur to Phuket then the same on the return. Planes were new and in great condition, all flights bar a little turbulence were smooth and I am not a good flyer. You want a bargain price with good decent planes I recommend AirAsia, I was hesitant in booking with them and after 4 flights in their planes I'd book with them again at their prices.
",,,,,
"  Flew from Kuala Lumpur to Taipei. Arrived at the airport 2 hours before the flight and hard the announcement that we had to proceed to a check-in counter immediately. Walked to the counter but no one was there and the 'closed' sign was up. When the attendant finally appeared, I asked what the urgency was or if the flight time had been changed. This was out of curiosity as both our flight to and from Bali the previous week had been delayed. The attendant immediately gave a very curt reply ""your check-in time closes at 9.00 and if you're late, we cannot be responsible"". There was no need for such rudeness. I then pointed out that passengers should not be summoned to a counter simply to find it closed. Her reply was, ""well, we can't satisfy everyone"". Ironically, it was all for nothing as I am now sitting at the gate 40 minutes past the stated boarding time and there is no movement. Undoubtedly, it will be our third Air Asia flight in 10 days to be delayed. I should also add that even when some of the reviews mention the delightful array of food on offer, there is almost certainly no chance that you will get your choice if you haven't pre-order.

"  Kuala Lumpur to Auckland via Gold Coast. This was my first time to Auckland, and I decided to take AirAsia X as the fares were much cheaper than other airlines servicing the route even though their flights were direct. It was a pleasant flight and the landing at both airports were good. One thing which bothered me, though, was the checking of bags and belongings at OOL. The food that I ordered was a bit overcooked. Other than that, it was perfect.",,,,,
"  Auckland to Kuala Lumpur with a short stopover at Gold Coast. The flight was not that full, and the plane was able to depart 5 minutes early. The flight was smooth all the way until a few hours before landing, turbulence was evident but the captain was able to minimise it. This time, the food that I ordered (roast chicken with stuffing and cranberry gravy) was really dry, and the accompanying vegetables were unpalatable. Landing at KUL was a bit bumpy.",,,,,
" Sydney to Cochin via Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia X. Was pleasantly surprised by the legroom offered on both the aircraft. Their punctuality is to be praised. Pleased with the selection of food and beverages available for purchase, that too at a very reasonable price. AirAsia X offers good connections to Asia from Australia, with seamless transfers through KLIA2. Would highly recommend for budget travelers.",,,,,
"  Been through flying AirAsia X more than 15 times and service can be inconstant.  On my recent flight from Auckland to Gold Coast, the flight was barely half full for the evening flight, so we departed early, After the seatbelt signs turn off the cabin staff did not appear until about an hour later starting the meal services. The pre-booked meal out of Auckland was overcooked, bland and small portion. They didn't give a set of plastic cutlery, instead only giving the spoon for the meal. When asking the knife and fork one of the FA reply that the meal only need spoon and we have deficient for the fork for this flight. A complimentary mineral water was not served until asking them. At Gold Coast we disembark with stairs and after the transit check we board again with new set of crew, for this 7hr 50 flight , a lovely Australian or New Zealand FA serving my row was most friendly that I have had encounter with - she kneeled down when interacting with every passenger.",,,,,
"  Kuala Lumpur to Tehran. It was my first time taking Airasia X and I didn't expect too much from it, since it is a low-cost airline. I almost missed my flight (because of the traffic in the airport), but the plane has not departed, even though it had passed the boarding time. Inflight, the seat is small but everything looked okay-ish, nothing special. During the flight, they served free meals. The meals were decent. Surprisingly, they gave you free mineral water (served in bottle) which was unexpected, since they usually charge you for that (at least a short-haul flight).  I ordered a food online, but they did not serve me, which was disappointing. Overall, it was okay.",,,,,
"  Flew Perth to KUL, 11 December, D7233 in economy section of the quiet zone with Air Asia X. At Perth airport, boarding was announced according to zones which was totally ignored by passengers and gate crew alike. The check-in was prompt and efficient but lacking any friendliness but that's fine as long as the job is done well. On board, the seats were horrific. They are 3-3-3 abreast on what should be a 2-4-2 arrangement. If you are anything more than a medium sized person, the seats are narrow and uncomfortable. Surprisingly, the leg room was reasonable for economy. The crew were great; efficient, polite and pleasant, in particular Korean flight attendants. The food was the usual minuscule portion but there is an impressive selection of things that you can buy on board for reasonable prices. Unfortunately, most things were ""out of stock"" as the phrase goes in Malaysia as they had run out on the flight over from KL. All I can say is that it's an uncomfortable flight made easier by nice crew. The flight was 5.5 hours in duration and any longer and it would have been unbearable. The toilets were dirty and the sink was clogged and that didn't change throughout the flight. Although this was the quiet zone, the premium cabin in front had a crying baby which pretty much destroyed the atmosphere of the quiet zone.",,,,,
"  Kuala Lumpur to Sydney return. Great for budget-minded travelers, but the seats could get a little uncomfortable for long-haul flights. The crew was amazing and the take-off/landing was smooth. We managed to make it to the destinations earlier than scheduled without delay (which is a surprise!), so no complaints there. Would certainly recommend AirAsia X for the KUL-SYD and return routes.",,,,,
"  Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo Haneda. Another great flight with AirAsia, this time with AirAsia X their long haul company and it was fantastic, I could not recommend it enough, low fare, great onboard service. I would recommend booking a seat at the rear of the aircraft if you're a couple as the configuration in economy thins from 3x3x3 to 2x3x2 and I was very happy here.",,,,,
"My wife and I flew Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur with Air Asia X on an Airbus A330. We were in Premier Flex which includes what is called a hot seat in the front row of the child free quiet zone, priority check in, boarding and exiting, 20kg baggage, one hot meal and a bottle of water. Any thing else you pay for. Left and arrived on time, crew fine. Great value for money.",,,,,
" Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo Haneda with AirAsia X. Price for air ticket alone is fair enough but not until you add on luggage and meals. Legroom is perfect, while seat width is unbearable for a 6 hours+ flight unless there is a empty seat beside you. KL to Haneda plane is showing sign of ageing and cleanliness of cabin and lavatory is terrible. However, flight from Haneda to KL is superb (on-time and clean, with attentive FA). Onboard purchase for food and snack with good and reasonable pricing. Overall, recommended for flight shorter than 6 hours / not midnight flight.",,,,,
" Kuala Lumpur to Perth with AirAsia X. Midnight departure and the boarding gate was crowded and cramped, managed by a solitary attendant. The PA system was scratchy and he could hardly be understood. Boarding was not organised. On board, attendants were efficient but not overtly friendly. They were a bit slow in giving out blankets but once done, the lights were switched off and the whole cabin was horizontal. Announcements on the plane were awful, especially the safety announcement. The flight attendant spoke fast and her words were not clear. There was only one attendant displaying the safety procedures in the business cabin and I could hardly see him from the other side of the aircraft where I was seated. They seemed rushed in everything that they did, or were they trying to be efficient? The food was a very small portion of coconut rice and spicy sambal (nasi lemak) which was gone in five spoonfuls. Not worth the money for that tiny meal. The rest of the flight was uneventful.",,,,,
  I was on AirAsia X flight from Seoul to Kuala Lumpur. The flight duration was 6 hours plus and the cabin was warm. I was seated at quiet zone window seat 8K and had to endure the warmth. Informed the air stewardess to check the air conditioner and she replied would check with captain but she never returned nor the condition had improved.  The seat and leg room are narrow and designed not for comfort. Food quality dropped too. The Pak Nasser nasi lemak is not fresh and tasted salty.  Not happy with this flight.,,,,,
"  Melbourne to Manila return via Kuala Lumpur, booked for Manila Clark but close the route earlier this year. Good flight in all outbound both left on time, return both sector slightly delayed, seats are ok, food was to be honest very tasty for my taste and service was better for those who book in advance. KLIA2 is a fantastic terminal find it hard to believe it is a low cost One. Only downside really was the Red lounge of AirAsia, the experience was horrible, on arrival no food available no selection of drinks, food only came out after staff notice there are people coming in. The  only good side is it only cost me 29AUD but would not use in future, instead will try the other lounges. In all what you pay is what you get, will definitely fly them again.",,,,,
"  Tokyo Haneda to Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia X. The flight was delayed by 15 mins but it has a great service, very nice Flight Attendants. The flight was almost full and I was seated at row 42A, the food was delicious. On the return leg, the flight depart on time an arrives 45mins early. On the return flight there is this very nice FA who smiled throughout the whole flight.",,,,,
  Manila to Kalibo. I am a frequent flier of AirAsia. I am always happy with the service that I am getting. Staff are really friendly. This is a short trip to fulfil a holiday and fantastic service. The best part is being able to sit within the exit row without paying for this.,,,,,
"Now everyone can fly because of cheap fares. In a way this is a good thing. However, I don't think it brings about all good things. Low cost, on the other hand, can also mean low quality. You basically get what you pay for. My flight with Air Asia Zest to Hong Kong from Manila had more of the negatives than the positives. To begin with, our flight was delayed for over three hours at Manila Airport. The aircraft was delayed in an airport somewhere. We were asked to move gates three times that just made everyone confused. None of their ground crew came to inform and reassure passengers at least. When the aircraft finally arrived, another complication happened. The air bridge was not working, so, we had to go down the stairs to the tarmac then stairs (again) to the aircraft. Perhaps we burned some calories but all of us got wet - it was raining heavily then. Passenger comfort was basic and the food I pre-ordered was not to my liking. We arrived four hours late in Hong Kong. AirAsia will get you to destination, that's it. Customer service and passenger comfort is not a priority for this airline.",,,,,
"AirAsia Zest is a low-cost airline with weak ground service and delayed on my flight, with misleading information on when the flight will depart. Aircraft look nice, but there is no entertainment system. They can have very cheap flights, but costs are sometimes hidden and if the flight is canceled or seriously delayed, a cheap ticket was of no help.",,,,,
"My AirAsia Zest flight was a short flight from Manila to Cebu, but a good trip. I arrived 20 minutes earlier than scheduled, my seats were upgraded for free and my check in luggage arrived on time in the baggage claim. Everything was good but unfortunately during my flight they took off the headrest covers on the seats, and the head rest looks unclean. For money I paid for and the service I got I was satisfied.",,,,,
The ground staff in Puerto Princesa Airport and air crew of flight Z2 427 were so kind and understanding. I have traveled via AirAsia (Philippines) 4 times and I haven't encountered any problems with them. I always find their crew friendly. The online booking is easier to navigate and payment process is smooth compared to the trouble I experienced with the other local airline. ,,,,,
"Airline ground counter staff very unfriendly and unprofessional, unable to make any decision in favor to the customer. Though I checked in very early as sequence no. 3 the system assigned me the very uncomfortable middle seat B. The ground staff at KLIA2 fortunately helped me to find another seat since the flight was not fully booked. Cabin staff most of the time busy with themselves, took them 2 hours after departure to serve the first meals and drinks. The passengers who pre-ordered meals got served first, the rest had to wait more. Scheduling and cancellation policy worst ever. Flight scheduled for 23rd of August was confirmed by mail on 19th of July but suddenly cancelled on 29th of July. At a very short notice I had to book another flight which was of course more expensive. ",,,,,
Airport used was the old Manila Domestic Airport dubbed the Terminal 4 and confuses you of a newer terminal but in fact it's an old terminal with no jetbridges and there is very poor ventilation. Zest Air is a disaster for Air Asia because it cannot be a part of the best budget airline in the world. Their airport staff in Manila are not friendly. Seat of your choice cost PhP100 even on check-in which is free-of-charge on other airlines. Their aircraft's are old and the painting is filthy (dirty) and the seat covers are torn and dirty. The cabin smells and the air conditioning is very poor. The plane I was on had several defective lights throughout the cabin making it darker. The flight attendants were friendly though but still the whole experience was a nightmare. I will never fly this airline again.,,,,,
Airport staff this time were as efficient as you can get. Check in was kind of a slow process and they do need to learn how to prioritize their lines. Not once did we get a final check in or express check in at the check in counters. By the time I got to immigration we had 20 minutes until our flight left luckily enough the immigration let us cut the line. It didn't really matter because we arrived at the gate to basically stand there for 15 mins. Our departure was at 10.50am we are boarding at 10.50am. Onboard the aircraft my seat was cracked. Staff were quite rude constantly asking us to sit down while they played who to blame for the delay. Captain didn't say anything which I found rude. It was only after 30 minutes that he informed us we missed our time slot. Cabin was quite hot. I never seen such picky flight staff in my life asking anyone who moved seats why they were moving and to proceed back to their seat. For dinner there was no stock left no meal no sandwich no coke. We finally arrived in Cebu only an hour late. “You get what you paid for and I paid only $120.00 for two tickets.,,,,,

Flew TAG-MNL or at least attempted too on a low fare. After waiting 4 hours at the airport flight was canceled. Next flight with space for 8 people (my extended family) was in 3 days. We ended up taking a ferry to another city and taking another Zest flight which was itself late. No vouchers for hotel or food. Pure mayhem. Don't be fooled by the fact that Zest has a new airplanes (they do) as this missing part is how to operate them with efficiency.,,,,,
Afraid I have to join the majority here. I had booked the 21.30 flight from Kalibo to Manila on 6 July 2013 with Zest. A day in advance I got an SMS and email that this flight was cancelled and we were moved to their 23.50 flight. It is almost that time now and we were informed the flight will come in around 2 am arriving in Manila at 4am. Instead of an easy night in Manila with planned arrival 11.30 pm I now foresee a night deprived of sleep. With hindsight I should have paid 8 Euros more for Air Philippines that departed nicely on time.,,,,,
I flew several Times with Zest MNL either to TAG an CEB. My flights were never on time and very poor customer service at all stations. Comparing it to the same price level airlines which are offered with in the Philippines I would recommend not to fly with Zest Air.,,,,,
Kalibo-Manila. Flight was 2 hrs delayed on June 20 2013. Flying back to Manila-Kloilo flight Z2 330 was 2 hrs delayed. Horrible airline and poor customer service. Not recommended.,,,,,
My trip from Manila to Tagbilaran was moved by 2 hours and 50 minutes got a 3 day notice from Zest Air 3 hours of wasted time and they refused to rebook me for free. Same thing happened to my return flight Tagbilaran to Manila. This time there was no notice that the flight was delayed by 2.5 hrs.,,,,,
Had a flight December 2012 from Manila to Shanghai. Flight delayed for more than an hour. Other than that I had no complaints on that flight. Seats are spacious and comfy enough. I also booked a returned flight from Shanghai and had to cancel it due to personal matters. Calling customer service via long distance call is quite a hassle but anyway my cancellation was confirmed and they told me it'll be refunded. Well now (5 months and counting) I still do not get my refund. Can't reach customer services. Very disappointing.,,,,,
Manila-Cebu return. They changed the flight time for both my flights (1hour and 2.5hrs) but failed to inform me properly so I was first rushing to the airport because I thought I was going to miss the flight. Then had to wait in the airport for 3 and 6 hours respectively because of their wrong texts! Both flights were delayed by 1 hour. Their online booking system works only occasionally. I'm never flying with them again.,,,,,
Had a great time flying Zest Air. The staff were courteous and very accommodating! Had a 10 min delay on my outbound flight from CEB-MNL I guess that was because of the heavy rain but it didn't really matter that much. Another 30 min delay for the return flight from MNL-CEB but it was ok since I had enough time to rest at the airport terminal.,,,,,
Have flown other local carriers within the Philippines and think Zest is a step above after my recent flight from Manila to Cebu. Fares were cheap staff friendly at check-in and onboard. Domestic Terminal in Manila is basic but not the worst in the country. Plane was new and flights on time but a limited inflight food and beverage offering. Would fly again.,,,,,
MNL-BCD return. You get what you pay for. We got the early morning flight to Bacolod only to find out the flight was cancelled. Had to go back home for the afternoon flight. Same thing with our return flight to Manila - morning flight out of Bacolod cancelled. Hotel staff at Bacolod informed us it is a usual occurrence. Such a big inconvenience if your vacation time is limited or you have to catch a connecting flight. Would rather fly with Cebu Pacific or Air Philippines.,,,,,
Bacolod-Manila return. Flight times changed on both flights from early morning to late afternoon with only a few hours notice. This caused many problems. Plane from Manila delayed again. Plane itself was ok but given the delays we do not have confidence in this outfit. With three other airlines serving this route we won't be flying with Zest again.,,,,,
MNL-CEB-MNL . Excellent airline good value and on time. Friendly and helpful cabin crew. Domestic terminal is small but quick and easy to negotiate.,,,,,
Legaspi to Manila. What a refreshing airline the aircraft we used was modern and on time pleasant staff.,,,,,
Flying to Manila from Bacolod using a brand new A319. A bit of a Delay but not a problem as the staff and crew were being very professional and handled it very well. Zest air recently renewed the cabin interior of their aircraft and they truly did a good job. The crew were very friendly and very helpful the entire time so it made my day! The landing was very soft and the entire flight was very calm. Not mentioning the spacious leg room and clean cabin environment!,,,,,
As experienced by most of the travellers using Zest Airways I got my taste of it too last weekend. My flights from Manila and Busuanga were all delayed by a minimum of 2.5 hours. The lesson of flying with this airline is seared into my brain that I won't forget it. So long Zest Airways.,,,,,
MNL-PPS return in aging A319 out of old Domestic Terminal. When Cebu Pacific transferred to T3 the experience at the old domestic became a lot more pleasant. Had a slight hiccup with my youngest since she was booked as infant fare when it should have been child. Ground staff sorted it out within the hour after a few well placed phone calls. Snacks and drinks for purchase but not necessary due to the short flight. Departure and arrival both legs were on time and crew was pleasant for the short 1 hour hop.,,,,,
Manila to Legaspi. Ticket bought 1 month in advance via Internet for about 15EUR no problems paying by card. Unfortunately had the same experience as Mark - the flight was cancelled. The official reason was bad weather in the target destination but later on met people having travelled to the same destination the same day but with Airphil. A majority of passengers were rebooked for the next day (they basically merged the 2 flights – was the low number of passengers the reason for the cancellation?). The next day everything OK the flight without problems. If you don’t care about time fly with Zest – it is cheap.,,,,,
Kalibo (Boracay) to Manila flight was full. Booked 2 months in advance for roughly 1100 PHP taxes inclusive about 20 Euro. Could not complain more legroom than on Air Berlin. Flight on time and crew efficient.,,,,,
Flown Zest Air 9 times and on 8 occasions the flights have either been delayed or cancelled. The customer service staff on the ground are generally incompetent and unprofessional - listening to their ipods and eating instead of serving customers. They frequently provide inaccurate information about flight delays and the customer complaint procedure will leave you pulling your hair out. So why do I fly with them - because they are cheap and thats the only reason! Would I recommend them - No! Unless you don't mind frequent delays and a cheap price.,,,,,
MNL-CRM-MNL. Aircraft outdated but not really an issue. Flight delayed but treated well by the ground staff. Gave us lunch and refreshments which was unexpected. On way back couldn't utilize the tickets but was refunded really easily. Call center very prompt in taking calls and staff very efficient. Good value for money!,,,,,
Caticlan-Manila. Crew and ground staff very friendly. The MA-60 is far more comfortable than the De-havilland Dash8 operated by other airlines on this routes when the weather is quite rough.,,,,,
Flew with Zest air on recently launched Manila - Marinduque service got through the airport and desks with great ease. The aircraft was a new Xian MA-60 very clean. No service onboard as it was a very short flight. Reading materials great. The flight was comfortable and smooth. The crew was nice and helpful.,,,,,
"  They didn’t send any check-in information on email or SMS, like every other airline company I’ve travelled with does. Then they charged us an extra €70 for airport check-in.",,,,,
 What a splendid surprise. airBaltic has leased plenty of aircrafts for summer 2023. First leg was Cyprus Airways. Old plane and the cabin attendants looked like suffering from the work. Oh take me back to warm Cyprus. Last leg by Carpatair. First class service with smiles and a new aircraft. I am now giving 10 points because there's was absolutely something extra ordinary offered by AirBaltic. Otherwise you're normally just sitting bored at the plane at least in economy class.,,,,,
"  Flight from Riga to Munich. Should have been leaving at 5.35 pm, when we got to the airport, no indication of delay, however, flight was delayed by more than two hours, no room for hand luggage, got stored throughout the aircraft, when asked for this staff super unfriendly, said you can wait when leaving the aircraft",,,,,
  I booked AirBaltic Flight to travel from Berlin to Riga and two hour before the departure they cancelled the flight. I had a very important appointment at the Embassy regarding my Visa renewal. Because of their Flight cancellation I missed my appointment and the next appointment which I got after 4 weeks. Because of their cancellation I have to reschedule and re-book whole travel and accommodation. When I claim for my compensation they’re not ready to pay,,,,,
"  Tallinn to Dubai. Departure time on second leg Riga to Tallinn changed 3 times. One day before departure flight Tallinn to Riga cancelled so I had to call and rebook to an earlier flight. Stay over instead of one hour, now 8 hours. Flight back from Dubai to Riga delayed by 2 hours and flight from Riga delayed by 2 hours. All that without as much as a free drink for 2 Euros offered. A free upgrade not to dream of. I can say easily the worst airline in Europe.",,,,,
" 6+ hour tourist route from Riga to Tenerife with one operational toilet in economy class, the other being ""temporarily"" closed. What a shame. People queueing up to row 20, entry into business class lavatory was firmly declined. Pre-ordered food was delivered by some random schedule across the plane, taking over two hours to be received and several check of the boarding pass (knowing the seat should have suffices). Add to that the not too unusual rudeness of some of the flight attendants and non existing leg space (on a mid-haul flight) - you get an airline that is best to be avoided.",,,,,
  Had a good prior experience with this airline but after not allowing me to board on the flight I simply cannot recommend travellers to use this company. No apologies or refunds provided either. ,,,,,
"  Not bad if you can find a flight at the right price point. Return flight ARN-DXB via Riga. Okay, lets get the worse thing out of the way - one toilet for a 7.20 hour flight does not make the grade. On the positive side. All flights were on time. Equipment is new. Both check in and cabin staff were better than average and price was exceptional compared with the premium carriers. No luggage police were on duty (unlike Ryanair). Seats a tad uncomfortable for the duration but reasonable legroom. Would recommend and book again",,,,,
"  Nice new plane. My flight was delayed over 3h, but what surprised me was how easy it was to talk to airline about that. I got clear instructions what to expect during delay when I called customer service. Also I did not have to jump through any hoops when requested compensation - all done in a simple form and without any issues.",,,,,
"  The flight was cancelled and I was only informed 2 days before the flight. I have completed their claim form for the compensation as I am entitled to it. But now they are stating that I was sent a cancellation message on 20 June, which is a lie. Up until now they couldn't explain why the flight was cancelled, and couldn't explain why I was only informed 2 days before the cancelled flight. ",,,,,
" Vilnius to Dusseldorf via Riga. Decent airline, all good but nothing special. A220 are fairly new, good seats, plenty space in the overhead bins even when boarding late. Crew professional. Low cost on board product, very easy to understand: You get nothing included. But that wasn’t a surprise as this was made clear during booking an the many upselling attempts via email. Even without buying a seat reservation there were plenty seats to choose from during online check in at no charge. No playing games or hassle concerning luggage at drop off. First leg a bit delayed, stopover in Riga (within Schengen) easy and well organized. Overall decent, but nothing great to remember. Can recommend to fly, if the price is right.",,,,,
"  Everything was nice and fast until we got into the airplane. On speaker they said we will leave in 10min, but instead we waited for an hour to depart (without any one saying why). So toilet for an hour was unavailable. Flight cost 300$ from Paris to Rīga and airBaltic do not offer free glass of water. It just felt cheap for what I paid.",,,,,
"  Being unfamiliar with eastern European airlines, and booking myself from Canada, I chose AirBaltic for times and cost. A huge mistake! My dislike began at checkin at Gatwick airport, when the young woman at the desk looked at my passport, determined that I was a North American, and was therefore beneath contempt. She screamed at me, ""Do you have a visa for Russia?"" I said, ""I am not so dumb as to go to this country without one."" Then she put a tag on one of my bags, but not on the other. When I pointed this one, she grabbed the untagged bag, and nearly ripped it. On the aircraft I received no attention whatsoever. At Riga things improved somewhat, as a staff member met me and showed me where to board my connection. The flight from Riga to Moscow was without any assistance or comment from the staff. At Sheremetyevo it took ninety minutes for my luggage to be delivered, at 1.15 a.m. ",,,,,
"  First at all checking in by internet was disaster site not working, charging extra money for no reason etc. Airline send mails to buy food on board. At airport we discovered that plane from Riga is late. but biggest surprise was on boarding -instead airbaltic plane was other company plane. At least plane and staff was ok. Biggest surprise was in Riga. We booked airbaltic and we found old old old Aircarpat fokker 100 instead. The plane so old and dirty. It was worst flight in my life. Try to avoid this conection in Riga because carpat air plane is not plane you want to fly.",,,,,
  The flight from Larnaca to Riga was about 2 hours late and there was no time for a connecting flight from Riga to Helsinki. The plane was told a completely wrong gate where we have to go and there was no connecting flight. In the middle of the night at Riga Airport without any information on how to proceed how to get home. No notifications were received by phone or email. Three hours of searching for information and bags at the hotel to sleep and finally 15 hours late arriving in Finland. I asked Airbaltic how they like to fix this. No answer,,,,,
"  Surprisingly, check in counters only opened 2 hours ahead at Amsterdam Schiphol (even though websites state the counters open 3 hours before departure). The plane was new and had decent leg room, much better than most intra-EU short haul flights. It was also clean with comfortable seats, however passengers were randomly changing to other seats.  No complimentary food or drinks - even a coffee will set you back 3.50 euros.",,,,,
"  Compared to many low-cost airlines in Europe, the service is much better, both ground service and onboard, reasonably fast boarding, and none of the usual struggles with luggage that one sees with other low-cost carriers. The A220 really makes most of the difference, the cabin feels more spacious and bright, than A320 and B737, there is plenty of room in the overhead compartment, and the seats are surprisingly comfortable (at least in short-haul flights), with ample legroom and the possibility to recline the backrest. There was a decent selection of food for purchase onboard but nothing special. There is WiFI onboard but no internet, so you can only access the same sort of information that you have on the onboard magazine, it seems like a lost opportunity. ",,,,,
" The good news first. Fresh and tidy brand new planes, punctual departures and arrivals, ok boarding procedures, very good legroom and seat comfort, clean toilets and nice crews. The sad part: overpriced hand bag extra weight allowance (with very mingy regular allowance), exorbitant baggage charges that make your ticket really over what Lufthansa charges, very mediocre organisation of transit procedures in Vilnius. Overall very good if the price is right. Wifi was advertised but didn’t work on the both flights.",,,,,
"  Our luggage and that of 67 other passengers was not loaded on the flight. Over 24 hours have passed and no update or communication from Air Baltic. I have spoken to people in Tallinn, Latvia and their agent in London. Nobody can advise or help in any way. The airbaltic tracker of missing luggage has not been updated since it was reported directly after the flight landed. Most of the effected passengers are competing in a sports event in Tallinn this weekend. Without our luggage we are unable to compete. 6 months of training and thousands of pounds are wasted. It is assumed airbaltic sold more luggage (because of bike boxes) to passengers knowing that there was no way the aircraft could have carried such a volume. They should never have sold the tickets and I will never fly with them again.",,,,,
"  The staff is great, very kind and helpful, they give out free tea and sandwiches. The seats are very comfortable, The entertainment is decent, if you are going to fly this airline then I recommend taking a laptop or a tablet with you. The plane is quite quiet and fast. Overall 8/10 airline.",,,,,
" Well normally I am happy about the nice and friendly air Baltic service. But lately they introduced couple of changes. 1) 8 kg for the hand baggage, all handbags incl. tax free stuff you bought in the shop. I paid 200 Euro for the return flight. I had to add extra money to be able to take the stuff that I needed with me. Common for high pricing tickets, you should allow more hand luggage. 2) If the hand luggage is a bit more than 8 kg, at the airport you have to pay 60 euro extra. That would mean, you can take only very few things with you and you can’t go shopping at the tax free. 3) These hard conditions are super stressful and no fun more fun to travel anymore with this airline.",,,,,
"  I had a business trip from Stockholm to London, I entered the cabin of my airBaltic flight the cabin was great and the seats and lighting were perfect, especially the massive windows which were a nice touch to my flight. The take off was smooth there was no turbulence, my pre-ordered food was delicious and the cabin crew were so nice and kind. The descent and landing was smooth. Its very cheap for its comfort, its hard to believe such a small airline is so good! I hope that airbaltic will expand more and get more aircrafts. ",,,,,
  airBaltic provides at Checkin and Boarding hand  sanitizer and pleasant experience. On board each passenger gets an envelope with two facemasks and two disinfection tissues. Cabin was clean. Bathroom one of be largest I have seen with soap and hand sanitizer. Full service which you have to pay for.,,,,,
  They cancelled my flight and would only offer an 80 euro refund. The flight was 450 euro. The customer service was very poor in dealing with this matter. I was outraged and still haven’t received my 80 euro! They’re a scamming airline. Very poor service. ,,,,,
"  My flights were cancelled yet airbaltic won't refund the baggage fee; is that not insane. I have filed a complaint with the Latvian Consumer Protection Agency: Rule 261 provides for refunds for any flights that arrive into, travel through or depart Europe. On March 18, 2020 the European Union issued a clarification to Rule 261 reiterating that cancelled flights are eligible for refund to the original form of payment. To file a Rule 261 complaint you are directed to send an email to the country’s governing body for each airline or for the gateway or destination of your flight. ",,,,,
"  Warsaw to Almaty via Riga. I was cheated by the airline. Because of the coronavirus, all flights got canceled as borders remain closed and yet, the airline refused to give me a refund even if I asked them a few times to do so. Never again!",,,,,
"  Nice to Riga via Tallinn. It's a shame to pay 60 euros for 3 kilos extra, for items I purchased at the duty free. This is not acceptable. airbaltic only care about money. Never again.",,,,,
"  Palanga to Saint Petersburg via Riga. Quite a nice experience. Air baltic provides an awesome connectivity around the baltic states and beyond. Check in, boarding, staff. Choice of planes is quite a pleasure; specially the A220; huge windows, great seat pitch, mood lighting, etc etc. The only downside is pricing. Its certainly not cheap, specially if you need to add check in luggage, meals, seat selection or overweight hand luggage.",,,,,
 Rip off and scam. Be aware. Warning. This company is a rip off like some others once your bags are overweight. I paid 60 Euro for 7 kg overweight. Today with people anyway not flying because of fear this shows how this company works and how they treat their customers in today's environment. I just can hope that airbaltic will suffer with this policy. A nice move would be a warning and wish a good flight. ,,,,,
  Riga to Zurich. Company is a joke. Hand luggage weighs few kg extra and they have the cheek to charge 60 Euro! Better take any other company and pay more and be comfortable instead of this airline. Worst customer service I’ve seen from an airline. You take money and then have the audacity to be sarcastic to the customer?,,,,,
"  St-Petersburg to Brussels via Riga. At the departure of the airport of St-Petersburg, I had to pay for a supplementary fee for a checked baggage instead of a carry-on baggage even if it was one of the correct size. As I did not want to miss my flight, the officer did not hear any of my argument and forced me to pay the 60€ fee instead of the 16€ fee for an overweight luggage, without any regard for my consent. As this kind of behavior is qualified as a scam, I am truly offended by this event. I strongly do no recommend this company which does not respect the EU consumers' rights. I hope you will avoid it as much as it is possible. ",,,,,
"  Riga to Paris. I just had the most humiliating flight experience. The ground service team (gate control) before letting people on board is just terrible.  First of all everyone got their hand luggage checked with a ride attitude, and if you even had 100 grams over the absurd 8 kg limit, you must pay 60 euros to get in. that 8 kg limit also includes anything you bought in the duty free store in the airport.  Now to my experience flying with my already small violin case. As in most airlines, musicians, most specifically violin players are allowed to bring their violin case on board without extra charge, because if you can't place it in the overhead locker (if it is already full because of other people luggage) then it just easily goes under the seat. That being said, the flight was half empty. And the boarding gate control knew it. Nonetheless, they looked for every opportunity to cash money in. But with music instruments is a whole another thing. You see, we cannot allow them to be placed in the hold. There are countless examples the one of a kind and highly valuable wooden music instruments that get placed in the hold are crushed or beyond repair, because of the temperature and the their fragile state. That's why also oversized music instruments, such as cellos, can be taken on board. The most horrible thing is that the gate control had the audacity to demand me payment without even letting me see the rules about music instruments. And they demanded that the already small violin case is being taken in to the hold. With the knowledge that the flight is half empty! I don't understand how cruel a person can be. And if it were not for the understanding stewardess, then we would not be taking the flight. ",,,,,
"  Vilnius to Berlin a very pleasant flight. Since my last experience with airBaltic they have updated their fleet with new A220-300s. The procedure of online check-in is very clear and quick, and for now it's possible to use a mobile boarding pass -  not required to print it. The flight was punctual, smooth and uneventful. A220 is a nice aircraft, rather quiet, seats are very comfortable and spacious. All ground and cabin staff were polite and helpful. And a very reasonable price. Will definitely fly airBaltic again.",,,,,
  Berlin to Tallinn. I found the service professional. The cabin crew and the airport staff were friendly. The flights were very good. One thing needs to be improved. I prefer that there is no change of gate at the airport which happened in both of my trips.,,,,,
  Vilnius to Amsterdam. I was charged an additional €60 for my cabin luggage such was 10kg in a normal Samsonite cabin sized suitcase. Apparently their policy is to allow only 8kg? I have never had my bag weighed by any other airline. Why should 2kg matter.  I won't fly with Air Baltic again. Its not about the money ... its the feeling of being fleeced by am unscrupulous operator.,,,,,
"  Brussels to Riga. Planes are mainly comfortable and crew onboard is nice and friendly. Food and beverages what you can buy onboard is also good. Flying is good and comfortable, but check-in and boarding are below average. I have been flying all over the world the last 10 years. So I share my last experience with Air Baltic. My flight from Brussels to Riga should depart 9.55. Real-life we depart 10.15. Not so big deal we arrived on time. I was 07.30 in the airport to do check-in. After my arrive check-in just opened. Before me was 9 persons to check-in. Then I was next in line and check-in lady was replaced. The new lady lost her ID card so she was unable to do any check-ins. So lady before and the new lady walked away and they only say somebody will be here. So finally check-in was done. They check in 10 persons with one hour. Then I go shopping and then boarding was announced and everyone told to be quick so we can depart on time. Never heard that kind of announcements before. May by Air Baltic you change your boarding system. It is unacceptable to say that kind off announcement in my opinion. I have used Air Baltic before 4 times and every single time I had some issues in check-in. It looks like that their check-in and ground service is really below average. So also we wait for 1 hrs for our check-in luggage at Riga airport. So if you are ready to deal all that crap before the flight for low-cost flights I recommend Air Baltic. I rate planes and comfort on flight 4 but ground service -1 so the total score is 2. If they but more attention to ground service I think they will be a much better airline. Air Baltic first opinion is most important. I hope that in future if I use your service again I get a better experience.",,,,,
"  Helsinki to Barcelona via Riga. Having gone with them twice before and being disappointed both times i reluctantly gave them another shot, and how i wish hadn't. These guys are literally unbeatable at the level of unfriendliness to people. Right at check in, despite having put extra care into my weight limits and allowance (i booked an extra seat for musical instruments) i got second-guessed and barked at. The cabin crew were ill spirited and seemed annoyed at the sheer presence of people. It doesn't hurt to treat each other as human beings, does it? Dont give these guys your money. Avoid at all costs.",,,,,
"  Never flying with airBaltic again! I flew with them from Vienna to Riga, in October. One of the worst travel experiences. They lost my baggage, returned it five days later, visibly damaged, and said they can only reimburse the expenses I made (clothes and personal hygiene items, since I was left in Latvia with zero belongings) up to 40 EUR, and only for personal hygiene items. As for the luggage, they said I should fix it at one of their partners, who just so happen not to have offices in my country. They are quoting a law from 1999 and hide behind the ”we did everything that was possible” disclaimer in order to avoid responsibility. Avoid at any cost!",,,,,
"  Riga to Oslo. Very poor and inconsistent customer experience. Was told at the departure airport that my hand luggage would be fine and quicker as I had short transits, since I was eligible for checked in baggage but didn’t have any. Then got charged at the gate of Riga airport.",,,,,
"  Cheap airline, will never use them again. Started weighing carry on baggage at the time it was time to board airplane. It leaves you no time and no option to take anything out of carry on bag, if it has overweight, because simply you have no place to leave your belongings. So you have no other choice than just pay 60 eur ,and check in your carry on bag. Usually other airlines check your carry on bag at the time you get tickets, so you can take anything out if you need to and put it into your check in luggage, but this airline does it at the boarding time, so they could make that extra 60 eur from you. There plenty of good airlines around, so stay away from airBaltic, if you have an option.",,,,,
  Riga to Gatwick. Never flying with Air Baltic again. Made a whole load of people check and weigh their luggage. I knew I was slightly over the weight (400g) so removed something from my bag and then put on my pocket.  Partner had to remove things and add to my bag to make his fit though it was fine on the way out. Then they reweighed mine. Luckily ok. Absolute nightmare and they were charging people €60 a pop!,,,,,
"  Athens to Hamburg via Riga. Red eye flight on A220-300, plane looks nice but noisy for such a modern plane. You could have slept from 4-6 in the morning but the noise was bothering you. Flight attendants were indifferent and unsmiling. They do not offer even a glass of water or coffee, you have to buy everything.",,,,,
"  Riga to Tbilisi. My first flight with AirBatic went smoothly, but that was only 35mins. But a 3 hour flight was terrible. The plane was the hottest plane I have ever flown on. To the point it was making me feel physically sick. The cabin is a 2-3 layout. But the air con for the aisle seat on the three is non existent. I felt the seat were also uncomfy. True design of the seats is truly awful.",,,,,
"  Tallin to Riga, this specific flight ran rather smoothly. As you would expect from a flight that is only 30mins. No problem with boarding. No real issue of note.",,,,,
"  Gatwick to Riga. This airline is pleasantly surprising. The value of money wasn't bad but not great,  this is the only route to Riga from Gatwick so the prices weren't the best but it's okay. Ground service wasn't much as a half-budget airline, but the crew does seem very nice. The seat is very comfortable as a modern aircraft with mood lighting and everything making the atmosphere nice with music and small TV screens showing flight progress as well as time etc. Food-wise, as this half-budget airline, of course, it has paid for meals. The value of them is considerably better if we compare it to say Ryanair or EasyJet. If you don't like to wait for your food to be reheated, don't buy the sweet and sour chicken with rice, yes it's good but if you don't like waiting, try avoiding it and buy something like a soup or a wrap, both of which my mum tried and enjoyed very much. The chicken and rice were on point! I'm quite biased as a Latvian myself but I'd recommend flying this airline.",,,,,
  Stuttgart to Riga. Bad service of the staff. I bought the tickets for my mother to visit me and due to her poor English language knowledge I reserved seat for extra cost so that I could print her tickets in advance. At Stuttgart airport flight 262 14:25 (terminal 3) my mothers tickets were initially not accepted and the entrance in the plane delayed. The staff did not support her on this until after all the other people had entered the plane. She was distressed and helpless. Eventually she was let on the flight and the seat I had booked was still for her available. I do not understand how this my so called priority booking for her turned out in such disaster of cancelled ticket that was not recognised by the crew.,,,,,
" Riga to Munich. Delayed by more than 30 min. Completely chaotic at the Riga airport at the gate. First, a gate change at boarding time was announced (as if the airline does not know before). Then before boarding started two very unpleasant air Baltic staff made people weight their carry on and make them pay in case carry on had overweight. But instead of putting it in the airplane belly, they let people bring their oversized and over weighted luggage into the completely full airplane. Obviously, there was again total chaos on the plane because of too little space. Although airplane seems to be ready, we did not board for mor than 30 min. I had the feeing they first want to check every carry on for oversize and weight. Staff on the plane was very unfriendly too. In total a very unpleasant flight. I cannot recommend!",,,,,
"  Paris to Riga. I was expecting better service from Airbaltic since I paid more for business class. It turns out the service is worse than budget airlines. Worst airline ever I have taken. I had to remove and put the luggage onto the belt a few time and the ground staff made no attempt to help me with my heavy luggage. He sat and watched and kept commanding me to put the luggage onto the belt even after I asked nicely “would you please help me with the luggage”.  After he told me that his name is Keith when I asked him, he turned to talked to his colleagues in French and they all started laughing. I know he was talking about me asking his name because I heard Keith in the conversation, which made me suspect that Keith is not his real name. The English proficiency of ground staff is very low. They spoke in broken English and couldn’t explain to me clearing.  The manager thought that my English is not good and explained to me the whole situation again in writing. For info, English is the first language in Singapore. The staff made only me measure my hand carry and claimed that it’s oversized. I saw some other passengers hand carry luggage were clearly oversized too but they are allowed. They initially told me that I have to pay 55EUR for the extra luggage and then changed this to 60EUR when another manager was present and insisted that he told me that it was 55EUR. The air stewardess skipped me when serving the welcome drink and the menu. When I asked for them, she then checked my seat number. How is it that you do not even know who are your business class customers? I did not pay extra for business class for the above poor services. It is very unprofessional to treat your business class passengers with such poor services because she is Asian.",,,,,
"  Tallinn to Milan. I was dreading flying with it. For a cause, I was forced to fly with it. Why so cheap? No normal beverages or food on the plane and then you have to pay 60 euros even if you've paid for your carry-on luggage? Why do you have to do it?",,,,,
"  Moscow to London via Riga. Worst airline in the world! I've been denied boarding to the connecting flight in Riga without an explanation. After spending 6 hours in the airport with my mother, we've been told that are fine to go, then they sent us back to Moscow instead of the onward journey. Avoid at all costs",,,,,
  Riga to St Petersburgh. Airbaltic has no idea what good customer service mean. They  have no exchange policy on ticket that cost more then 400$. They trying to make money just ripping off they clients and not providing excellent service. Terrible to make money on clients on extra hand weight luggage.,,,,,
"  Berlin to Vilnius with airBaltic. Delayed by 45 minutes. Short flight. Seats were narrow and very little leg room. I noticed 4 flight attendants - 3 male and 1 female. 2 of the 3 male flight attendants attended the business class passengers, which there were none. They sat at the business class seats for the majority of the flight. The other male and 1 female flight attendants started selling drinks. When we deplaned, not a smile or goodbye from the flight attendants. It's ok. They probably didn't speak English.",,,,,
"  Vilnius to Berlin. We really can't recommend AirBaltic to anyone. Short: They are cheating with their scales, showing two kg more than the actual weight of your baggage to threat you with paying 60€ extra. Both flights were delayed. The service on the plane is lacking everything. Detailed: We were two persons checking in one baggage. At the check-in shelter we got told to reorganize our belongings since the baggage was too heavy (allowed are 20 kg for the checked-in and 8 kg in total for the hand luggage). We stepped aside and used the scale next to the AirBaltic shelter to make sure our baggage would fit into the weight limit. After putting on another layer of clothes and reorganizing our belongings, we double-checked the kilograms with that scale. Back at the check-in shelter their scale suddenly showed 2 kg more again. Same with the hand luggage! Both had ""overweight"" even though we just checked it at the scale next to it! AirBaltic is cheating with their scales. I was too confused to say something, but the grumpy guy at the shelter was ""nice"" to only give a threatening warning for next time. After getting to the gate we put off the additional clothes that we put on to save weight in the luggage (We are thin people, don't blame us for that), but they checked the hand-luggage of each passenger again while boarding. Many people got charged for overweight luggage and had to pay 60€, if they wanted to get into the plane. That was stressing us out, we put back on all the clothes, only to put them off again after passing the check. Never had such a stressful boarding in my life! Flying back and forth with AirBaltic, both the connections were delayed (Maybe due to checking the passengers' luggage twice). While waiting for boarding, there was no person to answer questions and no excuse given for the irritating delay.  While flying you don't get any free drinks, even for water they make you pay extra. The seats are too narrow and make you sit very stiff and compact to not disturb anyone else. For choosing a seat on your own, o wonder, they make you pay extra. The seats are listed in different price categories. It was the cheapest connection we found, but after this horrible experience we will never decide for AirBaltic again and won't recommend this company.",,,,,
" An excellent flight from Riga to Copenhagen. Friendly and efficient crew, and great legroom. Flight was very punctual. My only criticism is that the 737 on this flight was 20 years old, so quite worn.",,,,,
"  Riga to Geneva. Airline charges every singe extra gram, including any  Tax Free shop acquisitions (60€/luggage). Staff attitude is very unpleasant. Unless required, won’t use this airline again.",,,,,
"  Riga to Oslo. Terrible service! All passengers checked and charged 60 euro for overweight, even if only 1kg, jackets, pocket contents and the book in your hand included. Passengers that took their clothes on accused by the company representative for being childish. If checking in less than one hour before departure you get charged 35 extra euros.",,,,,
"  Vilnius to Amsterdam. The weighing of hand luggage created huge lines, people were irritated and were made to pay huge fees. If you fly from other countries with AirBaltic they never weigh and create such bad situations. Only in Lithuania! Fix your attitude!",,,,,
"  Tel Aviv to Tallinn via Riga. My cabin luggage was 400g overweight and they made me pay 60€, while saying that if you don't you won't get to the flight. At the same time they knew that flight was being delayed! I had friends who could deliver those overweight things to me next week for free!",,,,,
"  Riga to Frankfurt. We were forced to weigh our hand luggage and pay 60 eur for excess luggage due to 2 Rigas Balzams bottles that we bought at the duty free! They also changed our seats randomly. As much as i would like to support the local industry of my home region, I am leaving a negative review because the whole experience was a big nuisance and could have been avoided (e.g. bigger airlines dont enforce such strict hand luggage policies). Will try to avoid in the future.",,,,,
"  We checked our luggage at Riga Airport on August 2, 2019, and all was in order. When we picked our luggage up at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam it looked like it had been caught in a wedge, as the entire right side was caved in and the handle was completely snapped in half. We immediately filed a report with the airline representative at baggage claim and subsequently filed a claim directly with AirBaltic and waited for a response. On August 7, 2019 we received an email from a customer service rep from the airline, instructing us to take the damaged luggage to one of their authorized repair shops to have it looked at and evaluated for reimbursement or repair. Problem is, all the authorized shops are located in those cities that airBaltic services, which does not include the United States, where we live. I informed them of that fact on August 10 and have not heard anything back from her. After a lot of searching I was able to find airBaltic's U.S. website and forwarded all correspondence to them on August 19, 2019, with a request to contact me. As of today, August 26th, I have not heard anything from them. Given the lack of service on the part of airBaltic, I urge anyone considering using this airline to find another carrier and avoid this airline like the plague.",,,,,
"  Zurich to Riga. I booked the flight just 15 hours before departure. I got the confirmation and could Check-in online. The next morning i arrived at the airport and they told me that the flight has been cancelled. No E-Mail or no SMS they sent me. The next available flight is 9 hours later. After asking for compensation, they give me a voucher of 12 CHF and I should send an email. No support from ground-staff or helpline. Flight at night was ok. But Not even water, they provide. I will never book them again.",,,,,
  Riga to Athens. This was a night flight. The cabin crew were very kind. We had ordered food which was really good. A bad things was that the cabin crew turned off the cabin light in the middle of the flight. The seats are very comfortable. The little screens that show flight information are very nice.,,,,,
"  Flew from Oslo to London via Riga, my experiences with both flights were great, staff were friendly and spoke good English, as well as Russian, German and of course, Latvian. I recommend flying with this airline.",,,,,
"  St Petersburg to Rome via Riga. We just came back recently from long overseas holiday we were longing for years and years.  Only one disaster, a huge one! All flights for our holiday were pre-arranged and paid in full to Jetabroad on 8th of June 2018. In St Petersburg, on 1st of July 2019 at 10.00 am we were ready to take AirBaltic to Rome, Italy. We were at airport at 8.00 am. The queue was huge; still we have managed to hand over our suitcases and paid tax at 9.13 Am. The security checks after that were unusually long; I never see in my life anything like that! We were in queues constantly, and when we reached the point to board but were told is too late and told we have to buy new tickets to Rome! In process of buying new tickets to Rome I was told to ask for refund for luggage tax paid previously. But, at the desk they told me: “You can ask for tax refund the latest 30 minutes before departure of particular flight!” Even, now, I am confused. Doesn’t make sense to me at all. So, I didn’t get any money back and I have to pay for the second time luggage tax for the same luggage.",,,,,
"  Riga to Reykjavik. A truly awful experience. We traveled from United States to London and then took airBaltic from London to Riga. No problems. Baggage was accepted. On the return flight from Riga to Iceland, we were required to pay 120 euros because our carry on bags were 1kg over the weight limit. Yes 1 kg. We told the attendant that it was the same luggage and weight on the way over and we didn't have a penalty. She demanded payment in a very loud and militant voice that we must pay 120 euros. She was awful. Militant is the only word I could use to describe her very rude behavior. Take a different airline is my advice.",,,,,
"  We were flying from Riga to Vilnius. The ground staff was rude and forced us to weigh our cabin luggage again which had been approved by the origin airport. They said that the luggage was 11 kg and wanted us to pay 60 eur or throw away our personal items due to ‘excess’ weight. When we finally left the place and we looked back, both ground staff women were laughing.  Even on the aircraft they are rude and impolite. Their English is very poor. Never fly again with this shameful airline",,,,,
  Tallinn to Zurich via Riga. A bunch of thieves. I booked a flight and when I had to check in online it was not possible to select a free seat. I had to pay additional. Its like when you book with these guys you dont get a seat with the regular ticket. At least that makes then unique. Never seen anything like it. Not even with any low cost carrier.,,,,,
"  Tbilisi to Oslo via Riga. Horrible airline! Don’t buy any ticket. I have bought 4 flights from airBaltic and all were delayed. My last flight delayed for 14 hours. I bought this flight for 450 euro. Not cheap one. No attention, no accuracy, no respect. ",,,,,
  I flew with Air Baltic from Riga to Vilnius and got an absolutely ridiculous fine of EUR 60 for 1 kg hand luggage overweight and the rudest service ever! Please be aware that they also weigh your tax free bag which does not make any sense! I will never cfly with them again.,,,,,
 Horrible airline! Flew with bag from Frankfort to Rīgā. Forced to check the Same bag on the return flight. Will never fly with this airline again. It is run by a bunch of kids.,,,,,
" Helsinki to Prague via Riga. My Horrific Experience With Air Baltic On 26 June, I, my wife and my 4-year old son were to take an Air Baltic flight from Helsinki to Prague via Riga. The stopover in Riga was to be for about 30 minutes for changing flights. The Helsinki-Riga flight started late by about 15-20 minutes, which meant that the transit time was reduced to 15 minutes. To their credit, the Air Baltic crew at Helsinki and on board told us that the Riga-Prague plane will wait for us. Halfway through the Helsinki-Riga flight, the crew announced that the Riga-Prague plane was to take off from Gate C5 at Riga airport. The flight landed at Riga airport around 5:45 pm. While quickly moving out, we double checked with the air hostess that our Prague flight was to depart from Gate C5, and she confirmed the same. The moment we reached the airport, we scrambled to get to Gate C5 which was nowhere near. After running and panting for about 10-15 minutes with a 4-year old kid, we finally reached Gate C5. However, it was closed and there was no Air Baltic staff there. We thought we must have missed the flight. We then thought of finding the Air Baltic customer care and inquire about the next steps. Just then, I saw that the flight information screen flashed the gate for our Prague flight B6. Shocked, we scrambled again and ran almost a kilometre to reach B6, where an Air Baltic attendant was about to close the gate. Fortunately, we managed to catch the flight at the last minute. We couldn't help thinking how insensitive it was for the airline to run with so much miscommunication with its passengers. The huge inconvenience we faced could have simply been avoided had we been told the right gate on board. For some weird reason, Baltic Airline only allows 20 kg check-in luggage per person, whereas the majority of other airlines in Europe provide a 23 kg limit. Now we had purchased three full tickets, which entitled us to 60 kg in total. We had two check-in pieces of luggage, each weighing slightly over 20 kg, but cumulatively weighing much less than 60 kg. The airline said we will have to pay an additional luggage fee of 50 euros per bag since they were overweight per ""per bag"" limit. Now I don't know if other airlines to follow the same policy, but it seems purely silly because by packing a little more in two bags, we were saving for the airline the space for one full bag. The plane would have carried 45-46 kgs instead of 60 kgs which we were allowed - so I don't understand what purpose does ""per bag"" policy serve. In any case, this added to our overall terrible experience with Air Baltic.",,,,,
"  Riga to Zurich. I had a carry on luggage of 8kg and bought 3kg of duty free goods at Riga airport. They weighed everything combined and had to take away my luggage and charge me 60 euros as the weight exceeded 8kg. There is no free water served on these flights.  A disgrace of a company, to be avoided at all cost!",,,,,
" Riga to Düsseldorf. Got charged 60€ extra because my backpack was a bit too heavy for hand luggage! So I ""had to check it in as a normal bag, it costs 60€, no debate!"" I will try to prevent flying with airBaltic in the future! Better use Ryanair or Wizz Air, they don't try to charge you 60€ extra for backpack that is a 'bit too heavy'!",,,,,
"  Riga to Bordeaux. Terrible airline, worst service ever, humiliating experience! Don't recommend anyone this airline, but especially if you are musician. Stay away from them.",,,,,
" I am very disappointed about both flights - from Riga to Frankfurt and return. On both flights they changed my 5 years old daughter's seats, so we needed to wait when they change our seets, but we still could not sit all family of three together (on both flights!). And on return flight they took away my bag from cabin because there was not any free bag space on plane. So now I am sitting with some stranger next to me who is not my husband and I don't have my bag with me. That's good that some nessesery items I have in my daughters bag. I feel really angry and disappointed! And plane is still not going, there is still delay.",,,,,
" This flight was a part of ticket sold by KLM and it was operating from Amsterdam to Tallin by airBaltic. Ground staff was very friendly and helpful. I've got a good place in the plane and we take off on time. However service on board was only paid which is unacceptable and low-cost airline. In my opinion airline shouldn't refuse you at least glass of water to avoid dehydrate. Water should be minimum. However me and my luggage got on place on time, so the goal has been achieved.",,,,,
  Moscow to Paris via Riga. I am very upset with the attitude of the airline. I missed my flight because of a huge queue at the control. The woman who was supposed to help passengers was just standing there announcing that “gate closes in 4 min”. When i approached her to help me skip the line she was rude and said that it is not her job and continued announcing that the gate closes in 2 min. Finally I came to the gate when it was already closed. The next flight I was offered is leaving in 10 hours. I didn’t even get a hotel and have to stay for 10 hours in the airport with two 5 eur vouchers for meal,,,,,
"  Barcelona to Moscow via Riga. Barcelona-Riga I was charged 30EUR extra to do check-in. Apparently, I must do check in online with extra charge of 8EUR. In the airport they did not accept to do 2 payments of 15EUR with my card neither, they sent me to pay by cash and they did not care that I did not have cash with me. It was my first time with this company, never again!",,,,,
"  Gatwick to Riga. Comfortable plane and excellent take off and landing. But, cabin service was extremely poor - attendants simply failed to offer any food or beverage. Could not understand announcements in English. And airbaltic is the first airline I’ve ever known not to offer free water to customers. Absolutely shocking.",,,,,
"  I flew from Zurich to Riga with an  A220, the flight was slightly delayed due to other aircraft. The airplane was clean and the cabin staff very helpful and friendly, unfortunately no internet access on the flight. I commend this company, which is developing.",,,,,
"  A 50-minute flight from Riga to Tallinn on a Dash 8 bombardier, plane in excellent condition as well as the comfort of the seats. The staff during the flight was a bit absent, moreover I recommend this company for its efficiency and punctuality.",,,,,
"  St. Petersburg to Prague via Riga, it wasn't that bad after all. No cabin baggage weighing or measuring as mentioned in some reviews, there was nice staff greeting us on board and the plane was clean. IFE consisted only from the in-flight magazine, but it was pretty thick, enough reading for two hours flight. No food, snacks or water during the flight, but you know that before taking the flight as the company's strategy is going low-cost.",,,,,
"  Gatwick to Vilnius via Riga. Terrible customer service. We was denied our flight to Riga from Vilnius due to delay of their inbound flight from Gatwick. It was explained that we missed our last flight and should go to collect luggage and go to ticket office for travel re-arrangement. Lady in reception told that air Baltic offer for us can offer only ground transportation to Vilnius airport. When one gentleman asked for flight next day it was told that there is no chances to stay overnight (""no available hotels in Riga that night"") and that all flights from Riga to Vilnius on next day are fully booked. Then after doubts how it can be that all flights and hotels are overbooked in Riga she told that probably the is 1 seat, then ""maybe 3 seats"" in morning flight, but hotel for sure she cannot book, and if we wish we can do it on our own money and then apply to refund of 70 EUR. When we started negotiate ground transfer, story continue very interesting way - it was told that cab cannot bring us to hotel/home address, only to drop off in Vilnius airport. After emotional complains why we need to go by cab to Vilnius airport and then back to city by taxi at 5AM , she firstly told that it is because our destination is Vilnius airport, and we will be delivered right here (even if it is after 4 hour drive and no taxi in Vilnius airport at that time). Then after 5 min of emotional discussion she once again changed her mind and told that OK, we may take taxi in Vilnius airport and then to submit receipt to refund. When we told that this is stupid, that we need to cross all city and then go back, she told that ok ok you may ask transfer driver to drop off in your destinations only if this is on way to airport. No consent was given to sign for us, just she gave voucher to driver, and that's it. Now I have problem with insurance company.  I not even mention kindness words used like ""sorry for inconvenience"", ""I will do my best"" or any provision of refreshments, etc. When we finally asked surname (name was on card) of receptionist she told that this info she is not obliged to provide.So, all long story short - airBaltic represented as it’s best Soviet heritage of customer service with ""Service provider always right"" and ""No, we can't"" attitude. If you want this experience, you may try to travel with this airline. For me enough is enough! I chose airBaltic to London via Riga instead direct flights Vilnius-London with WIZZ and Ryanair because I was expecting more intelligent and kind attitude, and paid for it extra 100 EUR per ticket. How naive I was!",,,,,
"  Larnaca to Copenhagen via Riga. Airbaltic has the worst cabin service i have ever experienced. Both when flying to Larnaca from Copenhagen via Riga, and home trip, there were small delays, which meant we literally ran to gate to make the flight. And even though both flights are operated by air Baltic instead of a quick apology and a smile they bark orders at you, to hurry and are super unfriendly. Only with airbaltic I have experienced that people are having some difficulty with fitting the cabin luggage into the overhead compartment, and the cabin crew are just standing and eyeballing instead of helping. I could go on. But all in all airbaltic is just disastrous airline, and to make matters worse airport in Riga has also lots of issues. So are you flying with airbaltic through Riga, you are almost guaranteed a disappointment. ",,,,,
"  Stockholm to Tallinn via Riga. I have travelled three times with this airline on the Tallinn-Riga-Stockholm route. All three times the flight from Tallinn to Riga has been delayed, causing me to miss my flight from Riga to Stockholm. Air Baltic put me on a later flight, but the wait is usually more than 3 hours. When I write to the airline asking for compensation, they always say no. This is in violation of the European Union's Flight Compensation Regulation 261/2004. So I write to the Consumer Agency in Latvia, they take my case and Air Baltic, reluctantly, pays me compensation. This is not a serious airline. Customer service is dismal; and the airline staff is rude and unfriendly. Avoid this airline if possible.",,,,,
  Berlin to Riga. Every time I have to flY with Air Baltic is a delay - information is rubbish and in one occasion even after 4 hours delay they insist in not pay even for a bottle of water. One of the worse airlines I have ever had to deal with. If you can avoid please do so.,,,,,
"  Berlin to Tallinn. Customer service level is unacceptable. Once the airline experiences delays, no apology, explanation given until later on. During the delay (delay that results overnight), no water etc. is given to passengers nor to pets that airline charges a fee for! Refused claim despite the EU regulations. Email is not answered, 10 working days has passed as per their rule. Do not recommend it neither to people nor passengers travelling with animals especially! This is one of the many incidents I have experienced with Air Baltic, therefore, it had to be shared because enough is enough.",,,,,
"  Baku to Amsterdam via Riga with airBaltic. The flights were supposedly 6 hrs total, it was 17 hrs: no explanation, rude staff at transfer Riga, they shoved me off with 2 vouchers for 2 coffee. I waited 9 hrs on a overcrowded airport. No lounge seat. During first flight they were assuring me the connecting flight would wait: not so. They did not even offer water or some food as consolation. Handed in my claim : according to EU regulation 261/2004 AirBaltic is accountable and should pay for my loss of time (i missed out on a meeting on top of it) No response whatsoever. so now I have to hand in my claim to get this case settled.",,,,,
"  First time flying with with Air Baltic to Riga from Berlin-Tegel. Received several changes of flight schedules one week before the flight. Tried to ask by calling their customer services related to flight changes but no good solution offered. Nevertheless I accept the flight changes as they are the only one serving the direct route from Berlin-Tegel. They used aircraft CS3000 for both flights and the cabin is clean enough. The seat has large space. The cabin crew was OK und did their duties well. My return flight was cancelled. The Air Baltic Service Management did not provide any clear information related to the delay, compensation and next available flights. I had to change to several lockets to be able to rebook my return flight to Berlin and to get a room at hotel. They also reject the compensation under the EU regulation which is still applicable for the delay of my return flight to Berlin. In my opinion, I don’t recommend to fly with them as its customer service we’re so awful and did not help the passengers much.",,,,,
" Helsinki to Zurich via Riga. The worse flight (including check-in counter) experience I have ever had in my life. AirBaltic has proven by far that they will do anything to take money from you laughing at your face. The staff at Helsinki is absolutely terrible, the cabin luggage policy is a bad joke that should be prohibited (max 8 Kgs). Airbaltic pushed it so far that they deserve an airline category just for them “worse-cost”. Airbaltic and the whole experience is a total disgrace for the entire airline industry.",,,,,
" Flew Riga to Kiev. Apart from painfully slow customer service on-board, another deceptive and annoying thing is requirement to pay for adjacent seat allocation within the same booking. I know this tactic has been previously employed by some low costers but it was then pulled due to negative publicity and complaints from customers. Hopefully the same will ultimately happen with airBaltic.",,,,,
"  Paris to Riga return last June. Air Baltic lost our 9 year old daughter's luggage, which happens from time to time. That is understandable. We arrived in Riga on a Thursday for a six day trip. It took them until Monday night to get our daughter's bag to us in Old Riga, just a few miles from the airport. She was without shoes or a coat and we put off making purchases, knowing the luggage would be delivered quickly. As each day passed, we were given vague answers and handed off to other people. We ended up having to purchase clothing and toiletries for her, and Air Baltic refused to refund us for the bulk of the purchases, saying they would pay only 40 EUR. I was not upset that they lost our luggage. I am very upset, however that they would not resolve our problem until two days before we were to fly home, then they would not reimburse us for necessary items, and here is is mid March (this happened last July) and we still have not been paid the 40 EUR that they promised. They are treating us like we did something wrong, when we were just innocent customers. I will never  do business with them again, even though the flights were fine and fairly priced. Poor customer service continues to haunt us 8 months after they lost our daughter's suitcase.",,,,,
"  Helsinki to Hamburg via Riga. Small propeller aircraft, not much space inside. Very impolite staff at Helsinki, checked the hand luggage at the gate very exactly - €60 if it‘s even one more kg than allowed. Fee for choosing a seat even at online checkin. Bought a croissant at €5 - very very small and dry. It seems that they just want to sell as much extras as they can, got several emails with advertisings for that before my flight. And the the ticket wasn’t even cheap. Will definitely never fly airBaltic again.",,,,,
"  Helsinki to Riga. Ridiculous cabin baggage rules. 8kg limit for carry-on case, handbag and duty free shopping. Even 1kg over will incur an incredible fee of 60 euros. Clearly something to make more money. Will always go for other options in the future, even if 40-60 euros more, just out of principle. An experience like this is enough to put me off for life. ",,,,,
"  Riga to Frankfurt. Web check-in smooth, guaranteed seats together at an additional 9.99 EUR p.p. Unfriendly staff at gate in Riga, picking out guests with probably ""oversized"" hand-luggage, overall their luggage-policy is creating a mess on the ground as well as in the aisles. New Bombardier CS300-aircraft impressive at first sight: attractive mood-lighting, really good seat-pitch, smallish monitors overhead each row featuring airshow only, but still better than nothing, and the first good sound-system I ever noticed in an aircraft for public announcements/lounge music. Large overhead-bins for the huge amounts of hand-luggage on a fully-booked flight like this. Contrary to inbound flight a few days before unfriendly crew. All drinks/food at additional, relatively high costs. The seats are hard as solid wood, headrest included. However the real letdown of this newly designed aircraft are the noise level and vibrations. Sitting above the wings feels like riding a rocket throughout the entire flight: whereas models like the A320 or B738 provide a smooth ride soon after takeoff, the CS300 gives you quite a noise and constant vibrations from the massive engines, which seem to be intensified by the hard seats. Weather conditions were absolutely okay, but the flight felt like flying through clouds all the time - not relaxing at all. So better avoid rows 14 to at least 22, the back of the aircraft was much quieter. Upon arrival in Frankfurt no sufficient amount of buses due to full load of pax and their hand-luggage. Last bus-load had to wait on the tarmac while aircraft was already being cleaned.",,,,,
"  Tbilisi to Copenhagen via Riga. This is the worst experience and worst airline. Staff are rude, even staff at Riga airport.  Flight got delayed in Tbilisi and the flight attendant lied that the connecting flight from Riga to Copenhagen will wait for us, but it turned out to be that it took off  before we land in Riga. They compensated us with a lousy 3 euro voucher for a 5 hour delay. Almost 150 people aboard were delayed too for different destination. Air Baltic does not care about customer service. When I told them this is the last time I am flying with them, they replied: your choice!.",,,,,
"  Geneva to Vilnius via Riga. This is worst than a low cost company! First, they refuse to serve you a glass of water freely as they are selling bottle of water on their menu. They do not serve anything free (I know it has changed now and some of them do not serve snacks etc, but at least water!). It would ok if it was as cheap as a low coast but this is not the case! I have a suitcase of 23x55x40 which normally fits airlines except Air Baltic - so I had to pay 60€ to check in my hand luggage. I do not recommend this airline at all.",,,,,
"  Riga to Budapest. A typical semi lowcost airline. The main hub (Riga Airport) is clean and nice, the ground service of the airline is nothing special. The legroom is amazing compared to other lowcost airlines and the cabin is very clean. Meals and drinks are available on purchase, the cabin crew served meals and beverages two times during our flight (you can preorder your meals too, the variety of meals is wide). The cabin crew was very moody, the couldn't make even a smile. Our flight was 2 hours 10 minutes long: this is the time what is unbearable on a turboprop aircraft. You cannot sleep and relax because of the noise.",,,,,
" For 3 years I have been flying with airBaltic and this is the first time I have seen them make money on luggage allowances. They stopped lots of people to check if the hand luggage fit their requirements. Usually mine is ok. This time they asked me for a 60e extra. The price is already expensive, how can they pretend to be low cost and have lots of hidden extras. I do not recommend them at all. The only point in travelling with them is that they have the monopoly unfortunately.",,,,,
"  Kiev to Tallinn via Riga. I am very disappointed by the airline. I had layover 40 minutes in Riga where I have to pass passport and security control. The plane from Kiev landed 20 minutes later. I was expecting the airline worker to met us near the gate, but there was nobody. On the passport control, there was a long queue. On the security check, there was an even bigger queue. However, only one line worked. Moreover, all people in the queue also were late, so I was not able to fast forward. We have managed to arrive at the gate 3 minutes prior the departure time and board the plane. The plane was Boeing 737-300 which is an old garbage. The brakes produced terrible noise. The interior was old. The tickets are expensive, while the service is worse then low-cost airlines.",,,,,
"  A shame of airline. They have lost my luggage (same for 2 more colleagues) in august and I am still waiting for a refund (21/05/2023). They don't answer my mails and I had to pay to a lawyer to try to solve this issue. For me, the worst company ever",,,,,
"  Fantastic flight. Despite a delay departing Narita due to weather, I really enjoyed my flight on Air Calin. The crew were fantastic - very friendly and helpful. Excellent onboard service, great food, a very comfortable seat and the cabin was clean. I would fly them again.",,,,,
"  This review is written from the viewpoint of not actually being able to fly AirCalin, despite wanting to. One of my favourite airlines pre-Covid but right now, they're proving to be unreliable. A real shame. Booked my ticket through Air NZ utilising the AirCalin operated flight for a late afternoon flight home on Thursday 27th April, arriving early evening. And why not? A nice leisurely morning a swim at the beach before lunch, then heading to the airport. A pretty decent early dinner onboard with a good red for the 2 hour flight. Sounds good right? But AirCalin has other ideas. First flight reschedule received was to Friday (28/4) morning at 9 o'clock. Not exactly stellar having to leave the hotel at 5 am but ok, I'll just book another night at hotel. Now today, one week from holiday, the Friday flight has been cancelled outright and rebooked on Air NZ (still pretty good but lacking that certain je ne sais quoi these days). Two things grate. I now miss a friend's wedding on Saturday afternoon and I need to schlep my bag to another hotel (since the other hotel is now full on the Friday night). A shemozzle but at least Air NZ have rebooked flights, veg meal and seat selection without drama on the Saturday lunchtime flight. Thanks AirCalin for messing me about, not once but twice. If and when independence from France eventuates, AirCalin won't be able to hide behind Paris' largesse. It'll need to stand and deliver. That'll be interesting.",,,,,
" When cabin crew ask for your feedback and thoughts on how they could improve you know they are genuinely committed to improving service. To be honest I could not fault them on our 2 hour 40mins flight. The plane was fairly new, very clean and the welcome aboard and service throughout exceptional. I had to compliment the crew on the food. The steak was perfect and tasted as if it had been cooked on-board. It bettered my steak experience from steak cooked on board in first class! I really look forward to flying Aircalin again and experiencing that level of customer service and care. Highly recommended",,,,,
"  Absolute rubbish service today at the start and the end. Check in line for economy was huge. I had a Qantas ticket (codeshare) and am Platinum with Qantas so attempted to use the premium queue, which was not permitted. Despite not having clients, premium Check-in desks were not servicing economy clients, preferring to chat amongst themselves. Flight was ok. On arrival, no carousel information and bags took over 30 mins to commence delivery. A PA on ‘we’re sorry for late delivery and miss communication’ really doesn’t equate to being a reasonable service. I won’t fly Air Calin again.",,,,,
 Melbourne to Nouméa. Surprisingly very good airline and good business seat for a three hours flight. Very good staff and very good product in business. Among them: Nikko Japanese whisky!,,,,,
  Noumea to Tokyo in economy and it was a good experience for a 8:30 hrs flight. The crew was warm and welcoming. The seat was comfortable with a lot of space for my legs and the entertainment system was complete. However the A330 cabin looked quiet old but these aircraft have to be replaced by mid 2019. The food was correct but not exceptional. Overall it was an appreciable flight.,,,,,
"  Nadi to Noumea. Aircalin is the only airline I have ever flown that does not allow for baby strollers, car seats or cots to be checked in without paying for additional luggage. Also beware when buying a fully refundable ticket. It is nearly impossible to cancel a flight on Aircalin. You can’t do it on line and you can’t do it over the phone. You can only do it in writing and then, if you are lucky, you may receive the refund 30 days later.",,,,,
" Flew Nadi, Fiji to Wallis Island. Aircalin is the flag carrier of New Caledonia and although a small airline, provided a good service. There were no boarding problems and the flight was on time. This was a very short flight and the cabin service was appropriate.",,,,,
  Noumea to Fiji. We arrived at Noumea airport at 10 am to be told that our 1pm flight was cancelled due to ash cloud from Port Villa over Fiji. Other planes resumed flying at 10.20am. Aircalin had already cancelled our flight and had no re-scheduled flight? How can you cancel a flight before the scheduled time? We had to return the next day at our cost to be redirected to Brisbane and then to Fiji with a 9 hour wait in Brisbane. There were only 10 passengers on the original flight that was cancelled and not re-scheduled.  Will never fly again with this airline.,,,,,
"  Sydney to Noumea. We had a very poor experience at check in, the lady was rude and did not even care to greet us or wish us a safe flight. I’m not sure what her excuse was for it but she was condescending and it really put us off right at the start of our vacation. Our toddler was trying to grab her attention to greet her, and she did not even acknowledge her.",,,,,
"  Flew from Nouméa to Ile Des Pins. Only domestic airline in New Caledonia, you have to accept their rules. Maximum weight for cabin luggage 3 kg (accepted up to 5kg, everything included), check-in luggage max 12 kg. Check-in is only allowed 80 mn before departure. No service is offered on board. However we flew on brand new, clean ATRs, with friendly staff, on time flights, and quick delivery of our luggage.",,,,,
"This is the flight and holiday we were planning to go on but due to illness and then unfortunately death of a family member, we chose to cancel our trip. The staff at Aircalin were great and informative saying that it would take between 6-8 weeks to process. We understood that, no problem. It has now been 12 weeks and we have seen no refund. I have called and emailed them numerous times and they are lovely and very polite, but I seem to be getting nowhere with information as to why this is taking so long. Just be wary if you need to cancel a flight for whatever reason.",,,,,
"A perfect flight with Aircalin from Tokyo to Noumea. Departure on time. Cocktail served just after take off, followed by a superb full course French meal. Complimentary French wines are very good even if not grand cru. And most of all the crew are friendly, efficient and professional. ",,,,,
"Kansai to Noumea on Aircalin. Boarding was long : we were called to queue and than we were standing 15 minutes before gate opened. Onboard service was perfect. Food was good. If you want to sleep, the seat is not flat but was acceptable.",,,,,
On the journey from Auckland to Noumea lunch was served which was tasty. The seats are very uncomfortable with very little padding in the back so you feel every movement of the passenger behind you. No Entertainment but this was fine for a short trip. Service was good and cabin crew were pleasant. On the return journey from Noumea checkin was very slow and took far too long. Breakfast was served on this flight and it was terrible. It consisted of a grey omelette which looked so unappetisng no one around me ate it. Also served was a bread roll and croissant which were fine. Overall the flights were fine but the terrible breakfast served up on the flight home was so disappointing.,,,,,
"Would have given AirCalin a perfect score, except for the return flight being operated by code share partner Air New Zealand which was simply dreadful. Web checked, bag dropped, boarding a breeze. Welcomed by friendly crew. The lunch service included a separate aperitif service (chose the pastis!), followed by a 3 course meal (salad, main and dessert) full bar service. After lunch was cleared, the crew came through offering duty free and a digestif (cognac). Champagne available for purchase. Used my tablet to connect to inflight wifi streaming entertainment as no PTVs fitted on A320 (only redeeming feature of Air NZ). Wifi worked perfectly. In summary, AirCalin offer a superb product at a fair price. Just avoid their codeshare flights between Auckland and Noumea.",,,,,
Food highly edible and service was perfect. Wine very good. The only disappointment was that the Qantas Business Lounge was dreadful. Everyone spoke English although French was preferred. There was no PTV which was disappointing.,,,,,
"Flight 801 from Manila to Noumea via Tokyo Narita. I was satisfied with their onboard service, cabin crew were friendly and polite. The food was delicious. Will fly with this airline again.",,,,,
My flight from MEL to NOU was a great experience. The check-in at Melbourne was very fast and efficient. Boarding was on time and the cabin crew were very welcoming and friendly. The plane is newest and safe.The economy class seat have not PTV's but the newest A320 equipped with new video on demand system connected by wifi on your smartphone tablet or computer. After Take off an aperitif followed by a hot lunch was served. however the cabin crew are not very far. My experience on Aircalin is not too bad.,,,,,
Sydney - Noumea. Didn't know what to expect from this smaller airline. Was a full flight with school holidays over. Staff at the gate were a combination of Qantas and Air Calin crew. Aircraft was a modern A330. Helps to have a small understanding of French because the crew will address you in French first. Really impressed by meal service. A full tray with salad bread main and dessert. Landing in Noumea on second attempt due to a go-around but crew were very professional throughout the flight. Entertainment system only covered a limited selection in comparison to other carriers.,,,,,
We travelled to Noumea on this airline-code share with Qantas on the outgoing leg and AirCailin on the return leg. The outgoing trip with Qantas was so sub-standard. With Qantas there was no entertainment we could see only two screens out of 5 visible in our section of the cabin and the meal served was inedible! However to my surprise the service was fantastic! The food was not only edible but enjoyable the service was swift polite and plentiful-the brandy at the end of the meal was a lovely touch. Individual screen for movies was also much appreciated. I would have no hesitation in flying this airline again or recommending it to friends.,,,,,
Fantastic flight Very pleased with the very high standard of service provided! Flew from Tountouta to Sydney on AirCalin on the airline's only A320-232. Very friendly crew Very nice meal (supposed to be a breakfast but lasted well into the afternoon) comfortable seats and pleasant views of the Pacific. One of the best flights I've ever been on. Very highly recommended.,,,,,
Flew NOU to SYD 23rd Oct SB140. Efficient check in at Noumea. On board A330 plenty of legroom in Economy. Great onboard service in in French and English very friendly. Pre lunch drinks offered as well as wine with lunch. Extra bread rolls offered with water runs and after lunch Cognac was also offered. Service not really expected for a 3 hour flight. Looking forward to my next Air Calin flight.,,,,,
AKL-NOU on A320 business class. The check-in and lounge in Auckland is very nice. The cabin is very clean and the seat is old but is comfortable. The pitch is good we only had a shared TV. During boarding the purser welcomed us and offered champagne or cocktails. We had appetizers followed by lunch.,,,,,
NRT-NOU on new A332s economy class. Check-in in Narita is very fast and friendly. Boarded on time and there were 2 queues one for the hibiscus class customers and one for economy class customers. On board the cabin crew were friendly and professional. On my seat I had a pillow a blanket and amenity kit. The new seat is very comfortable and ergonomic the pitch is ok and the cabin is clean and pleasant. Just 30 minutes after take off the meals services start and only refreshment was served. The new entertainment system has a wide choice and we could connect a usb port to the screen the headphones had good quality. 1.5 hrs before landing a breakfast was served and during landing candy was distributed.,,,,,
Brisbane - New Caledonia - Tahiti. First leg was in a bright clean new A330. Business cabin only half full. My e-ticket had said “cold meal” but I was served a full hot dinner with quality French wines for just a 2 hour flight. IFE was adequate but surprisingly had no classical music. Flight was 50 min late departing because of late arrival of the aircraft which I suspect was due ongoing issues at Brisbane airport. The fairly new international airport for New Caledonia was bright and welcoming. The business lounge was small but modern. Excellent canapés and miniature cremes brulées. The flight for the second leg was operated by Air Tahiti Nui. This was not a codeshare as Air Tahiti Nui do not offer the flight themselves. A bright clean new A340. I was served a full hot lunch with quality French wines. IFE was satisfactory by modern standards. Overall a very high standard of comfort and service.,,,,,
NOU-SYD. Lacklustre crew with very few smiles. Food of mediocre quality for Business Class cabin too hot and not adjusted despite request. Not an experience to remember.,,,,,
SYD-NOU return. What a disappointment-after reading some of the good reviews I was looking forward to the trip. The check in at SYD was a disaster-4 economy desks with only one manned until they could find one more as the economy queue got longer and longer Also the outward journey was delayed by 45 minutes with little explanation . Once onboard the cabin crew were condescending if you spoke no French and the food was stale. The PTV was ok on the A330 but I returned on the A320 which only had limited audio. This flight was also late. There was hardly any legroom and to top it all off the bags didn't arrive at the carousel until at least 40 minutes later.,,,,,
SYD-NOU Economy A330. Wonderful flight and service - especially compared to Qantas on the way back! Great food. Lovely wine and digestif..,,,,,
SYD-NOU: We departed with an hour's delay and arrived late not too bad though. The plane was super very new and very clean the staff attentive and the food great. It was a very French experience their English could be improved.,,,,,
The planes are quite new A320 & 330 roomy and comfortable featuring blue lagoon (fishes) seats. Nice PTVs (reliable and good quality screen and content) in A330. A320 have footrests adjustable headrest and good pitch even in economy. Hibuscus business class seats on 320 & 330 are very good especially for 2 or 3 hours flights. Meals are good even on short flights (NOU-BNE 1:35) you have a hot meal with choice of 2 dishes if the flight is on lunch or dinner time if not a snack or breakfast. On medium (PPT) to long haul flight (NRT & KIX) you have two meals. Wines champagne in business class liqueur after meals and aperitif. Overall good FA although it can really depend : there are better and worse FA. The check-in is usually efficient excepted during christmas holidays : additional flights and Noumea Tontouta's 12 check- in counters are not enough for 3 flight nearly at the same time. Boarding is quick and flight rarely late.,,,,,
SYD-NOU Business Class. Nice roomy A330 - very clean and well maintained. Friendly crew - nice champagne and wines but food not up to much. Pleasant relaxing and uneventful flight.,,,,,
NOU-NRT return. Almost new Airbus A330 good flight entertainment system but the crew wasn't nice and seem to be inexperienced and not very conscious about safety (customers walking in the cabin while the seatbelt sign was on). The meals were similar to low cost airlines and choice of drinks was also very poor. I wish I had the choice of another airlines between Noumea and Tokyo but unfortunately Air Calin is the only one on this destination.,,,,,
Brisbane-Noumea-Brisbane. The legroom on the A320 was great. The cabin service was ok. The entertainment program on both legs was very ordinary and the food abysmal - I am sure that the sandwiches and cake for the Sunday flight were prepared on Friday - they were extremely dry and the cucumber in the sandwiches had dried out and pickled itself. We did see a menu left behind from the previous segment from Auckland - it looked much better. The quality of food and entertainment really let the airline down.,,,,,
As a regular traveller throughout the Pacific for over 30 years I have found the Aircalin services especially good. The check in service is excellent and friendly the staff helpful for those who don't speak French. The menus are always a surprise with generous meals and drinks presented in immaculate style. Their new planes are first class in comparison with the Qantas 767 Sunday afternoon flight from Noumea to Sydney where old planes (200 series) and grumpy staff generally bring you back to earth with all of the finesse of a smack in the face.,,,,,
Travelled SYD-NOU-SYD with Air Calin. The experience could only be described as brilliant. Take-off was on-time in both directions food was very acceptable in-flight service was impeccable with wine drinks and quality French brandy offered to all in economy class. The aircraft was new and very clean. I would highly recommend them and would definitely fly with them again,,,,,
"Air Calin AKL-NOU (originally also NOU-AKL as well - but they decided to go on strike). Apart from boarding the aircraft (a beautiful A330) and waiting around an hour for who knows what reason as all passengers were seated and ready for some tropical sunshine and French culture which awaited us 3 hours away it was a pleasant and well done flight. My Kosher meal was bought to me before take off so I could ""break the seal"" and it could be heated up for me - the meal was nice but lacked presentation and creativity of everyone elses meals - which looked and smelt divine. The FA's all very well groomed and with mediocre manors were to some extent inhibited with their english skills which were good but just hidden behind shyness. The seats were very comfortable excellent PTV entertainment with each movie in four languages and at least 6 options + games - too much for a less than 3 hour flight. The inflight mag was also good but there wasn't much in the way of newspapers. Very scenic approach to Noumea - however I was a bit concerned about one of the stewardess' continuing a conversation with a passenger she obviously knew for half the flight (not actually doing any thing else after the meal was served) and continuing it until about 20 seconds to touch down - way after the announcement had been made to be seated. Tantouta airport is not made to handle a full A330 on a summer day it felt like there was no air con and the lines were horrendous - made worse with another wait for our bags. Customs was very relaxed though...as was any laws regarding smoking. Coming home was a bit of a feat. We turned up at the airport at 5 am after being told that there was only one previously delayed flight going to AKL due to a flight attendant strike or something along those lines. We were put up in a rat hotel by the airport by Air Calin until 1am in the morning when we were all shuttled back to the airport to check in etc (more lines) and a few hours later find out that our rescue ride home hadn't even left NZ yet - more waiting in one of the least entertaining airports in the world. Finally our air NZ plane arrived (on which my boarding pass was labelled with KSML yet did I get one - pity as I was looking forward to the far more entertaining Air Calin to carry me home and end my French Fling in my favourite holiday destination with a French Flair and decent service!",,,,,
I recently travelled Aircalin BNE-NOU-BNE in economy class and cannot report with the same enthusiasm as other reviewers. The meal out of BNE was served immediately upon take-off and fell well short of the 'French-style cuisine' advertised on Aircalin's website consisting of a stale bread roll 4 slices of cold meat and a bland lettuce salad. The seat pitch in economy was reasonable and the PTV's on the A320 offered a good range of options including movies games and destination info. FA's were efficient though it was obvious that French-speaking passengers were receiving preferential service. The return flight was delayed by 2 hours due to the crew needing a rest (bad scheduling?). Meal on the return flight on the smaller 737 was better again served immediately upon takeoff. FA's were not to be seen for the rest of the flight once the meal service was over. No PTV's on the 737 and the entertainment on the main screens was only in French with no subtitles. Generally the experience was very average and I would not be in a hurry to fly Aircalin again.,,,,,
Aircalin NOU-SYD and it was a very pleasant flight. Check-in staff was friendly and helpful. The meal provided for this early morning flight was very good and plentiful. Got an omelette with sausages French bread croissant brioche fresh fruit yoghurt cheese tea and coffee. There was also a second round of warm bread and drinks. The cabin crew was very pleasant and smiling. The plane was their 737-300 and it was a bit run down but Aircalin is replacing the aircraft with a brand new A320 in January. Well done Aircalin you are doing New Caledonia proud.,,,,,
SYD-NOU-BNE in coach and was pleasantly surprised by their product & service. The aircraft was a brand new A330 cool blue interior (seashell feature) each seat had its personal tv reasonable seat pitch given that I'm 6.2ft tall. The check-in staff at NOU were very friendly & helpful given that I don't speak french!,,,,,
I have just completed a round rip from Papeete to Osaka via Noumea with Aircalin. I was extremely surprised by the quality of service provided onboard and on the ground. I flew their Hibiscus Business class PPT to NOU then coach and I have to say that Aircalin beats several major airlines I have travelled with during the last few years. The plane used was a brand new A 330 aircraft and once onboard you can expect to be greeted with warm and friendly smiles from the flight attendants. The food was plentiful and varied. The entertainment system was tip top. All in all for very long flights a generally pleasant experience would definitely consider flying Aircalin again.,,,,,
  Thank you Airlink for the amazing service and comfortable flight. Staff are super friendly. This is my first time flying with Airlink and ii recommend that everyone flying should use Airlink!,,,,,
  I travel quite a bit every year to Europe and USA. I must say this is the best domestic flight I have had in many years. Airlink is good they offered me Lunch plus a good red wine. Excellent. I hope they become the no.1 Airline in SA.,,,,,
"  On boarding the aeroplane, the air hostess was polite and friendly. The cabin was small but it is to be expected. Both hostesses were impeccably dressed with neat hairstyles. The sound system relaying messages was clear and the hostess was well spoken. The meal of a healthy beef bun was well packaged and fresh and tasty. The sparkling water beverages too were cold and the tea was hot. The overall experience was one of feeling well looked after, treated with respect and definitely boarding an Airlink flight soon again.",,,,,
" Comfortable and on-time service with a super friendly and welcoming crew for my first flight on this airline. Even the pilots took time to engage with my 3 children, would not hesitate to recommend and fly Airlink again when back in the region.",,,,,
"  Airlink is a terrible and not reliable airline, I came from Frankfurt and connected with Airlink to Maputo, one of my baggage never arrived and Airlink was the airline responsable to make the follow ups and find my baggage. First their response is bad, terrible customer service, they do not give updates to client and I had to make several calls to their office in Maputo to follow up on my process, after 4 months of process they decided on my claim and only paid me back for the items I could keep the original receipts (which where only two pairs of shoes), I explained that I do not keep receipts since I never though that would be necessary to claim for a lost bag and most of the reputable international airline companies pay by Kgs in this kind of situation. This airline does not value their clients and does not help in case of need. I strongly advise you to not use this airline if possible, they will lose your bag and not adequately reimburse you for the value of your items.",,,,,
"  Eric Scholts customer service agent deserves a medal. I was travelling from Windhoek to Johannesburg with a group of 25 people. We had a connecting flight to Paris with a 3 hour lay over and my checked back was set to stop in Johannesburg, instead of continuing to Paris (causing the potential risk of missing my flight). Thankfully, I was able get assistance from Eric, who escorted me through an airport I’ve never been to before, to ensure I made my next flight on time. He explained each of the checkpoints I had to go through to get to my gate. His communication and customer service skills were fantastic. I had trouble through Airlink with my itinerary the night prior but I’m grateful I was able to get assistance. This man gets a 10/10, but the airline overall with the troubles I had the day prior get a 6/10, so overall 8/10.",,,,,
"  I am 94 years old and requested wheelchair-assistance, which was granted. I would like to thank all personnel for helpfulness and friendliness throughout flight and arrival in Cape Town. Assistance with luggage retrieval and safe delivery to family. I appreciate high quality treatment.",,,,,
" Airlink is an up and coming airline in Southern Africa that has been expanding. Surprisingly, its service is very good and quite friendly. My flight was a Sunday evening flight and a relatively short one of about 1 hour and 10 minutes. Those of us in business class were called to board first. Boarding was accomplished by a walk across the tarmac to the plane as it appears the jetways at Maputo airport are not operable. Passengers were seated quickly on this mostly full flight and take off was prompt. What was pleasantly surprising is that en route, we were served with a good light dinner that solved my issue with where to eat after arrival. The seat was comfortable and I was seated in a window seat on the left side of the aisle. Restrooms were clean and appropriately stocked. Service by cabin staff was efficient and friendly and we arrived in Johannesburg about 15 minutes after the meal service. I am quite happy with the service of Airlink as this is the 4th time I have flown with them. Their aircraft are nicely maintained, the crew is friendly and efficient, and they are increasingly spreading their wings through southern Africa. I am comfortable in recommending Airlink.",,,,,
  We had two flights with is airline Johannesburg to Hoedspruit and skukuza to Johannesburg. We were a bit concerned. If we go back to South Africa we would use this airline again.,,,,,
" First time using Airlink, check in very quick from a pleasant check-in agent. Security quick boarding was via a bus which is expected in this small aircraft, carry on bags also placed in the hold before boarding. Departed on time for this short 40 min flight, the service on this short flight carried out by 1 cabin crew was just great. Seat A1 so had the chance to chat to the stewardess who was very professional, comfortable seat a sandwich and coffee served before our decent to George. I normally drive this trip - not anymore great service great airline.",,,,,
" We took off on time and arrived about 15 minutes early. Ground staff and cabin staff were very friendly and helpful. The advertised aircraft was an Embraer E190 but they change to an E170 allowed a look at the model which I had not flown in before. The cabin had to be sprayed before take-off at Harare while we were seated and the smell was a bit overwhelming. That aside, the punctuality and quality of meals was pretty good. The selection of beverages was very good for economy class.",,,,,
"  Bags delayed twice with no compensation or report. Our bags were delayed by 26 hours on our outward journey, meaning that we had no clothes / toiletries for our first day and night. We had to purchase emergency clothes and toiletries as a result. Our bags were again delayed on our return journey by 36 hours - although as this was the home journey we incurred no additional costs. Airlink refuses to reimburse costs over ZAR 350 per day. I had purchased insurance to cover any additional costs, but I need a Property Irregularity Report for my insurer. Airlink is not responding to my emails, and is not issuing a PIR despite many emails chasing. Useless airline and I will be avoiding at all costs in future. The flights weren't even that cheap.",,,,,
  There was a single person manning the counters at check-in. My bags were overweight so was directed to another counter to pay for the excess which is no issue. But that took 20 mins as they kept allowing other customers in front of the line. In flight food was a joke.  Now have been waiting at the baggage conveyor for over 30 mins and no bags have come out. I expect this is due to the fact we arrived earlier than scheduled and were redirected to a parking bay other than the one designated for us and therefore assume this has caused some confusion and delay with the luggage being off loaded and reclaimed. I wouldn't fly this airline again to be honest.,,,,,
 Short flight but excellent service and excellent airline. Staff are really helpful and go the extra mile to help disabled passengers. I will definitely recommend Airlink.,,,,,
"  I booked a ticket from Cape Town to Kimberley and made sure the ticket can be changed. At 14:36 I called the head office as I was struggling to check in online and my flight was for 15:25. I was informed that the online check in have closed, but I should at least be by the airport at 15:00. I informed the lady that I might be there around 14:58. I was assured that if I at least be there by 15:00 I would still be allowed to check in. I arrived at the counter at 14:59 and the lady tried checking me in and called and called another person to hear how she should go about. at 15:10 I was informed to go to ticket sales where I can change this flight to the next flight. Upon arrival at the ticket sales, I was informed that I have missed check in with 4 minutes and therefore have forfeited my flight and need to purchase a new ticket. If the lady on the line from airlink head office would have told me that I need to be the check in by 14:55 I would have requested to move this flight to the next. However, I was informed that 15:00 would still be all good. I have the entire conversation on recording and demand a full refund or a free flight to Kimberley for this miss information. I can you forfeit an entire flight for being 4 min late and yet nobody has boarded yet.",,,,,
"  Domestic transfer lost luggage during my flight via Johannesburg. Despite the bag clearly tagged and marked for transfer to Cape Town, it was the only bag left behind. Once they did manage to trace it, Johannesburg baggage office had no knowledge of it having been there and Cape Town didn't answer phone lines. Several calls later they finally said its now in Cape Town and asked me what happened. Once they delivered the bag to my home the zip was open while the bag was still locked. No reasons provided by the airline on why it was lost or zip was open. Can't trust their transfer service, yet I have to travel with them for work.",,,,,
"  From the baggage check in, the boarding gates and the flight itself, the staff was so unnecessarily rude. My family and I were last at the gate with 15 minutes to spare before boarding would close, and yet we were met with rude looks and very obvious irritation. I tried to greet the lady and she intentionally ignored me. On the flight two of the flight attendants gave us nothing but attitude and made us feel like we were making their lives difficult when we didn’t ask for anything. The staff desperately need to be trained in customer politeness, otherwise they should not choose such a client-facing career. Everyone is stressed at the airport, a little kindness can go a long way. They acted like bratty teenagers.",,,,,
"  Airlink is a high quality airline. I am content with their service and cannot find any fault in them. Used them on a round trip from Namibia to South Africa. The first scene which stood out to me was viewing the plane in real life with the sunbird logo. The food packaging is divine. They had a real life high quality glossy sunbird image on them. First flight I received the “Scarlet-chested Sunbird”. Second time was the “Double-Collared Sunbird.” The birds are admirable in their colourful feathers and exotic designs. For the menu they began by serving a drink, followed by a sub-lunch with the option of coffee or tea. A few minutes later, air hostesses came around offering a drink one last time before the plane’s descent. I am glad they added coffee or tea to the sub-lunch as the lunch alone is not very filling. My first sub-lunch consisted of: rolled smoked turkey slices, creamy honey mustard pasta shells, butternut and feta salad. For dessert, which was my favourite delicacy of the sub-lunch, was the custard and jelly topped with white and brown chocolate shavings. Not sure whether that’s what it actually is, however that is how I would describe it. Final part of dessert is a gourmet fudge which was over sweetened in my opinion. I have a sweet tooth, however this treat was too sweet. My second sub-lunch, I forgot to capture the menu of the second sub-lunch, however I did snap a picture of the food so here’s me writing the meal in my own words: rice, baloney style beef and corn salad. Dessert was the same as the first meal. Food tasted delicious. I appreciate the sub-lunch not being too heavy. Plus the flight is short-lived, therefore a heavy meal is not necessary. To add, they have Schweppes lemonade on board. The refresher towel which came along the sub-lunch was useful in sanitising my hands and dining tray. The Embraer-190 is small but durable.  Return trip I booked a window seat with grand views. It was fascinating viewing the outline of South Africa colliding with the massive blue waters of the Atlantic Ocean, with all the shaping exactly how it’s portrayed in the maps. When flying over Windhoek I gazed through my window and was blown away by the 42 000 feet view of Windhoek’s terrains. Below me was a collection of mountains and shrubs. Airlink is gentle with luggage and cabin crew is polite and hospitable. A free copy of Airlink’s in-flight magazine in the front pocket. There is no in flight entertainment, which is understandable since the flight was short lived. It is worth mentioning if you intend to tag a suitcase along as hand luggage, they will collect it pre-flight and you shall receive it on arrival since the overhead cabins cannot accommodate larger suitcases. Airlink reminded me flying can be an enjoyable experience.",,,,,
" Very professional and friendly, helpful check-in staff. Flight left Cape Town on time, was amazed that a free dinner (no, NOT a stale sandwich!) and a drink were served (flying time 1:33 hours). Nice crew, pleasant flight, luggage arrived fast in Jo'burg.",,,,,
 Airlink are a decent regional airline and the staff are pleasant and competent. If you’re travelling in business class on the E190 I’d go for row 2 You get extra leg room or storage space under the seat in front. You can recline the seat without encroaching on the person behind you. The seat has 2 windows albeit slightly misaligned compared to row 1 which only has 1 window. Reasonable snack and a drink. Check in was quick in Windhoek. Downsides no lounge at Windhoek. Buses in departure and arrival with no special transport for C class. Appalling baggage retrieval time at OR Tambo but I don’t know if that’s the airline or the airport.,,,,,
"  Johannesburg to Bloemfontein. I have the worst experience that I have ever had in my life flying any airline. I have been in the same clothes since 4am this morning because of airline's negligence. We have been calling the whole day, we were lied to and told my bag that was offloaded because I was a no show even though I flew on flight that I was booked on. The lady I spoke to in the morning said after she made enquiries, my bag would be on next flight to Bloem that was at 9:20am and would be dropped off at the hotel by 11am, she would contact me. When I realised she had called, we called to check, told another story. I am still being told stories even now, I am filthy, have no luggage, have nothing to wear for the meetings I came for. This is the worst service I have ever gone through and he fact that nobody cares. Only one person tried to be helpful, but poor guy couldn't do anything because he was not where my bag was. Oh my God, this is such a horrible experience.",,,,,
"  We transported our pet via Petlounge. Airlink firstly charges double what Comair used to charge and they keep the pet for more than 7 hours. That’s 3 hours before the flight, 2 hour flight time and another 2 hours to deliver the pet to Petlounge. This ‘timing’ is inhumane to any animal. Any human being would not be closed up in a steel box for 7 hours! This service must be improved!",,,,,
" Very clean, nice staff, on time. If I will compare this airline to European/American 4 star airlines Airlink is much better every way. On such short journey as Johannesburg to Cape Town you will receive a complimentary food, you have checked baggage in price of your standard ticket, you will fly with Embraer with two-two configuration with very friendly and helpful staff (also on-ground). I do recommend.",,,,,
  Johannesburg to George. Thanks for great service and flight. Will definitely use AirLink again. Great lunch and drinks included and friendly staff.,,,,,
" Windhoek to Cape Town. Unlike the unfortunate passengers from previous reviews, my experience with Airlink was very nice indeed. We left Windhoek on time, arrived at Cape Town 20 minutes early, great! The windy Windhoek lived up to its name, so that the take-off was quite bumpy - as the captain warned us, so we were prepared, but once we left the cloudy area things got much better and calmer. On that short flight we got excellent service - wine, coffee, and light cold lunch which was actually delicious and nothing on that tray was there without a reason. The luggage was on the carousel faster than we got to it, and it was all over a very pleasant experience, thank you.",,,,,
"  I would never recommend Airlink if you are on crutches, walking stick or heaven forbid a wheelchair (they would probably take it from you and make you crawl), as the experience my father went through was pure hell and his already injured leg was in excruciating pain after his flight. When my father arrived at the Cape Town airport he asked for his one crutch to be put in the hold as using both on the plane is very difficult, they staff proceeded to tell him he would have to get it checked as abnormal and made him walk across the airport with no assistance, I wouldn't think trying to help someone on crutches that is in pain would be such a hassle. My sister requested my father to be put in a seat where he could stretch out his leg as it pain horribly when he sits for to long, but no they said to her of course and proceeded to put him somewhere where his leg was crushed thank heavens a kind man offered to swap seats so my father's leg could stretch out no help from the air crew though. When he landed this side I picked him up and the crutch that was put into the hold was stuck into the smallest setting, and it was so stuck I even tried to ask the one airport worker if they could help he could not even get it lose thankfully my uncle was able to use his vice to fix the crutch so my father could again use both instead of the one crutch as he only uses one crutch for short times as using only one hurts his leg far to much. My sister complained to Airlink after his flight about all of this and all they said is they offered a crutch and he refused which he did not as he would have loved a wheelchair as he was in immense pain due to all of this. AirLink obviously looks down on the disabled and when sia personally complains they blame it all on the disabled person, this blatant ableism is sickening I always thought basic compassion and some hint of humanity would win out to help someone who is struggling and in pain but I was horribly wrong.",,,,,
  Terrible experience with this airline. Beware! Our tickets got placed on hold due to Omicron/Covid. The airline refused to refund and are basically requesting the same amount of which I already paid to use the tickets. So they want me to pay double the price per tickets. Customer care is unhelpful and full of excuses just to take clients money.,,,,,
"  I really enjoyed my flight. The flight attendant was so lovely, very friendly and helpful. The flight was a breeze, a bit of a rocky landing, but in all it was a very pleasant experiences. I flew early in the morning, the breakfast snack I had, the sliders were so delicious!! Thank you Airlink, you never disappoint.",,,,,
"  Unreliable flight information, no updates for stranded passengers. They treated the delayed flight like nothing. Random swap of aircraft, random breakdown of ferry buses, random announcement with nothing useful from the microphone. The only thing certain is, as a passenger, you will definitely get stranded and have your holiday plan ruined by Airlink.",,,,,
" Johannesburg to Hoedspruit. My wife was diagnosed with cancer and required urgent surgery so we needed to cancel our 2 internal flights which came to a total of £420 [ZAR8400]. I emailed Airlink customer services and they told me they required proof which was understandable. I forwarded them a letter from the hospital confirming her admission, a letter from the surgeon explaining that surgery was required urgently and that travel was not possible, but they said that this was not adequate information provided and that we would not qualify for a refund. I was so shocked by their replies, was made to feel like a liar, when we had more serious things to deal with. Would strongly avoid Airlink as they are non-sympathetic, poor customer service, and frustrating to deal with.",,,,,
"  No sympathy for a customer at all. I flew from Durban to Johannesburg had a layover of 2h 15mins before flying to Angola. I had a negative covid results from a government clinic, had sma confirming my results, only to be told that was not allowed. I had to call the lab to send me one with a QR code. While we were waiting for results, the boarding pass closed. Later i asked if they can assist they told me i was supposed to change dates an hour before, but they never suggested that to me, then when i emailed them later, they told me the staff suggested i change the dates and I refused.  I did admit I didn't know that covid results wasn't allowed, as at clinic they assured me it was ok. Customer care is worse. I wouldn't suggest anyone to fly with this airline. ",,,,,
"  On their website they state that they allow one free date change due to covid. I reached out to them 8 days prior to my flight to make the change (since my previous flight was changed too) and they initially confirmed that I can do so for free, just pay the difference in fare. When I accepted it and asked them to proceed with the payment they went completely silent. No response to my emails that I sent daily. No one answered phone calls! 36 hours prior to my flight I made the change myself, paid outrageous difference since the flight was so close and also paid the penalty fee. Reached out to Airlink and asked for the refund, and  they did not reply again! ",,,,,
" What a mission it was to get hold of Airlink to change our tickets! Due to testing positive for Covid, our travelling plans had to change drastically. I held the line for Customer Service for 40 minutes until a rude lady picked up on the other end, sighing with every question I had.  Then came the public holiday so we couldn’t make any name changes or add a minor by ourselves on the website. Luckily I got hold of a very friendly lady the next day to help add a minor, but I still had to send an email for the name change. I phoned Customer Care on Friday at 15:50 and by 16:30 I got cut off. Still no reply to my email (with the address given as the emergency contact). It is the weekend now and Customer Care is closed. How could this be? With Covid we have learned that anything could change any minute, what should a passenger do if they have to change their flight details? Get on the flight even though they have Covid just because they couldn’t change everything on the website and don’t want to loose their money? Come on, Airlink, you could do a lot better to assist passengers affected by Covid.",,,,,
"  Understaffed and poor internal communications - lost essential baggage for a short business trip. I recently made a business trip to Cape Town for a conference. One of my bags therefore contained marketing material (rollup banners). I checked these bags in in Maputo, they were treated as normal hold baggage. I was advised that I needed to collect the bags in person at Johannesburg airport and re-check them in for the leg to Cape Town. Upon arrival at Johannesburg, the bag containing the banners did not appear - either at the carousel or the fragile/oversized baggage counter. When I attempted to make a baggage claim, the SA Airlink baggage claim desk was unstaffed. I therefore had to pass through customs and look for another desk. The transit desk was also unstaffed. I reached the main ticket office, which was fully staffed, however the staff there would not assist me, and sent me to a check in counter. The staff at the check in counter tried to phone their colleagues in the baggage team, however there was no answer. As my connecting flight was due to board, the staff member advised me to rush through security in order to reach the boarding gate. She promised to try to find the bag. I asked her for my claim number, however she stated that I should send an email to report my claim. I asked her why she herself could not send an email, at which point she stated that she could not help me further, since she did not have a computer. As I boarded the flight I asked the gate staff if my bag had been found but she was not interested and just wanted to get people on board. Upon arrival in Cape Town, again I tried to contact SA Airlink staff to discover if the bag had been found, however there were no SA Airlink staff in the whole airport. Upon arrival at my hotel I received a call that the bag had been found in Johannesburg, and was probably at Cape Town airport. However there were no staff there to confirm. I was given a number to call early the next morning. I called it multiple times, however it never answered. Late in the morning I got through to a number in Johannesburg, where a staff member admitted that they were having difficulty contacting the Cape Town airport branch and promised to call me back. On this day, I had to attend the conference at which I needed to display the banners. I ended up having to get alternative (inferior quality) banners printed up in Cape Town, in order to use at the conference. SA Airlink only confirmed that the banners had been found, at the end of the day, when it was too late to be of use. Despite the fact that some of the HQ staff I spoke to were pleasant and seemed to be trying to help, overall this was a nightmare. Two things became clear: a) SA Airlink save money by not having a full complement of staff at the airports - this means that there is no one to assist the passenger in case of problems b) The ground staff appear to be very unhappy and disgruntled, if you have any problem at all they just ""don't want to hear about it"". The aircraft itself was clean and the onboard snacks were OK, and the flights left nearly on time. So really this airline's weak point is lack of ground staff, poor attitude of ground staff, and poor internal communications.",,,,,
" Johannesburg to Cape Town. What a really nice flight. Very comfortable seats, on time and very pleasant crew. As a South African taxpayer, I'm so glad I'm not having to pay twice for the same trip as is the way with state owned airlines here. Keep up the good work Airlink.",,,,,
"  Worst service today, booked flight for a unaccompanied minor (10 years old), arrived at OR Tambo 2hours before checkin, had all the necessary documentation but was delayed by the airline staff to fill health questionnaires, my brother was then checked in but left by the flight and they did not bother to communicate as to what transpired instead they are saying we arrived late and should have been at the airport 3hours before.",,,,,
"  What a lovely experience! I hope I can use Airlink all the time. Everything from reservation, online check in, bag drop, boarding, punctuality and the friendly professional service on board made the whole journey a relaxing pleasant experience. The covid-19 protocol was very good - ensuring social distancing. The seats are very comfortable and my husband who sat next to me had enough leg room. The only downside [for me with limited financial means] was the price of the ticket, but it was such a treat to use Airlink that I will start saving just to be able to use them again.",,,,,
"  I had to change my children’s ticket because of changing COVID gov changed regulations and then when they were due to fly I had to change the tickets again as riots broke out in South Africa. South African Airlink profited from the above by forcing us to pay for new tickets.  Then when an international airline had a late arrival and my children missed the Aairlink domestic flight, Airlink forced them to buy new tickets.",,,,,
" Avoid at all costs. If flying with Airlink, this airline does not communicate with its customers so beware of gate changes, and boarding time changes. They have terrible customer service and rude / unprofessional employees at their gates and flights. Speaking to their ""marketing and customer relations officer"" was like speaking to a machine reading hidden policies.",,,,,
"  I would like to compliment Airlink on their service and professional reservations assistance for our flights to Skukuza from CT and back from Hoedspruit. They assisted with a cancellation in a professional and efficient manner as well as my daughter had to cancel a flight last minute due to Durban looting and riots. Their COVID Protocols as well as service, reliability, no delays etc. were great especially in a time when airlines have become unreliable due to the economic climate.",,,,,
  Had a flight booked for April 2020 and then Covid-19 lockdowns prevented us all from travelling. Seven months later Musi helped us change dates and Airport for later this year. He was so helpful and professional and organised. It was a pleasure dealing with him. Thank you for taking care of your customers through this tough time. We look forward to flying and supporting and will both be booking another two one way tickets - so will be continuing our support. Wishing you and the staff all the best until the international tourists return. Thank you and well done.,,,,,
  Johannesburg to Walvis Bay. Very pleasant experience with good service and comfort on board. Seats in business class are very comfortable and allow a lot of legroom in the first two rows. Boarding process in Johannesburg was a bit chaotic due to the ground staff and no bus being available.,,,,,
" Johannesburg to Gaborone. There is a noticeable difference with this airline, more attention is given to safety and communicating to clients. Very efficient, the aircraft was stunning and we arrived early. Overall the team seemed more professional and experienced.",,,,,
"  Maun to Cape Town. Never use this airline. Denied boarding because of a supposedly faulty passport. Forced to buy connecting ticket out of Cape Town, forced to leave my family and not join them on vacation. On arrival in Cape Town authorities did not find an issue with passport. The price for a ticket was already high and now the additional flight out of Cape Town that I did not use cost me another 700 dollars",,,,,
"  Every time I flew with Airlink (From Pietermaritzburg), everything was fantastic. Their boarding procedure, legroom, seat width are good. They have a nice fleet of planes, currently: the Embraer E190/170, Embraer 135, Avro RJ85 and Jetstream J41 (Avoid). The Avro RJ85 is comfortable but slightly cramped (I'm 1.8m tall). The Embraer E190 is fairly new and very spacious. They serve a snack and free beverages on these short flights.The only downside is that they are relatively expensive when compared to low cost carriers.",,,,,
Durban to George with Airlink. The Embraer aircraft was clean and comfortable. The air hostess was friendly. On the 1 hour 45 minute flight we were served a chicken wrap which was good. Even on our 45 minute flight from George to Cape Town we were served a cheese sandwich. However Airlink are fussy with luggage. They only permit 20 kilos; not 23 like on larger aircraft. Fortunately South African weighed our bags in Durban and made no comments. However in George Airlink do the check in and were charged excess luggage fees. But for 7 kilos over we paid only 15 US dollars. Our flights left and arrived on time. Fares on this airline though are relatively expensive.,,,,,
"Kasane to Johanesburg. Boarding with 15 minutes late due to late inbound. It was a full flight,once boarded and after we had taken off, the flight attendant came through with the trolley and offered a chicken sandwich. The sandwich was tasty. We hit quite a bit of turbulence once through it the flight attendant continued the service. The flight attendant was quite professional and all smiles.",,,,,
"  This was my first time flying Airlink. The flight was fine and food, seats and service were all quite good. However we (along with 11 other people ) were quite shocked when we reached Madagascar to learn that our luggage had not been loaded onto the plane. We had given our luggage in at JNB terminal 4 hours before the flight. We were also told that Airlink has no responsibility to get you your luggage in Madagascar after your arrival, necessitating a second trip to the airport on a subsequent day. For an airline to lose 12 people's luggage (out of 80 passengers) on a non-stop flight is unacceptable. We were told by someone else who regularly flies on this flight (she lives in Madagascar) that her luggage has also been lost on prior flights. A more minor but still very annoying practice of this airline is not to carry the visa form that must be filled out before entering Madagascar. The Air France flight that arrived at about the same time had these forms for its passengers.",,,,,
Johannesburg to Bulawayo in Zimbabwe on SA Airlink. Seats were comfortable and a meal was served flight together with drinks on this 1 hour 20 minute flight. Flight attendants were efficient and pleasant. This was a very nice trip.,,,,,
"Airlink from Kimberley to Cape Town, a 1h30 flight. Leather black seats with enough legroom and nice cabin interior. The were lack of space meant I had to put my tripod and a great part of my hand luggage with the cabin crew luggage. The plane itself only has luggage compartments on the one side. We were served drinks and a choice of beef or chicken sandwiches. It was a pity they chose cheap instant coffee as the genuine substitute. We departed ahead of schedule and arrived 22 minutes ahead at Cape Town. We had only one crew member who served well. All in all, when you pay near nothing (R850 is about USD $65) and get so much - a meal, drinks, good seats and ground crew you have to be mad not to realise the value. It goes without question that this is just a very ordinary route with nothing special going for it, yet it has enough to lure me in. I was satisfied flying with Airlink. ",,,,,
"  Horrible customer service, double charged and have now been unreachable and not returning any e-mails or calls for months. Pure garbage. The only way they are still operational is they have a monopoly on remote access. ",,,,,
"  Absolutely dreadful. These guys are terrible, they have zero care for customers. Flights cancelled without detail and no communication. This is a normal practice for them. Can't express my disgust with these guys, they have no consideration at all, ",,,,,
"  The only thing consistent about Airnorth is their inconsistency! I live in a town where it’s our only choice of airline so we have to continually endure rescheduled flights (I’m not talking about minutes behind, I mean hours and hours) You are forever missing connecting flights, losing money on motel rooms, rentals etc. Their pricing is typical of an airline who has a monopoly on a service, and I can live with that, but it’s the simple fact that they cannot provide a consistently reliable service for the money they get that infuriates me. And only providing a tiny bottle of water and a packet of cheese and crackers as in flight catering is poor. If you have the choice, never fly with this airline of inutility.",,,,,
"  Had the worst experience with Air North whilst trying to get to Perth during the pandemic. Booked a flight with them from Darwin to Perth and never received any details of the flight confirmation in my inbox. Tried to call customer service and email several times and said the line had been disconnected. My card has been charged and I've now been trying to get the money back for this flight for about 3 months now. Still unresolved, still haven't managed to speak to a single person in customer service at Air North. Now being resolved with my bank. ",,,,,
"  I am so impressed with Air North. The last time I flew with a different airline, I remember waiting ages for drink service that only came around once and paying something ridiculous for a small snack. But Air North blew that experience out of the water! Complimentary food and drinks are one thing, but this was only a 2.5 hour flight and they kept us busy the whole time serving drinks, a lovely sandwich, a cookie, and then more drinks. I was positively full at the end of the flight. And when I complimented the cookies (oatmeal chocolate chip served warm!) the very lovely stewardess, Keely, got me and my sister (my travelling companion) a few for the road!! She gave us good tips for visiting the Yukon, too. The airline was clean, flight was smooth and service was fantastic. I wish Air North flew everywhere - they would be my first choice every time.",,,,,
"  Flight changed twice from 5 and half hours to 8 hours and re routed from stop over in Townsville to Cairns with nearly three hour wait, then a trip into Gove before touching down in Darwin at 11.30 pm. I paid a descent fare to travel with a young child at reasonable time of day. This was a hell of a trip. Worst part is I couldn't ring to find out what was going on as no one would answer the phone. Disgusting service. I will no longer support the local airline once they have your money they don't give a toss.",,,,,
"  Totally unreliable and unprofessional service from Airnorth. Initial booking was rescheduled three times. Meaning I had to change hire car booking and appointments twice, the third charge I had to cancel as there was no time to organise accommodation. Rescheduled flight for the 9th of September. Plane has been delayed with no expected eta, no updates to passengers. As to why this has occurred. For a return flight time of two hours it has cost $1200, for this price we should get a decent meal on the plane. But $1200 we will a small packet of chips and a bottle of water. If only we had competition in the Northern Territory.",,,,,
"  Sydney to Kununurra . Thank you for the great service rendered by the flight crew for the flight that left Kununurra at 6pm to Darwin on the 23rd December,. All credit goes to them as it was the best smooth landing I have ever experienced.",,,,,
"  Darwin to Dili. An excellent flight - really surprised by the high quality. Early morning departure from Darwin led to a pretty generous breakfast - frittata, yoghurt, coffee and juice. Pretty amazing for an hour-long flight (and significantly more generous than what we received on our flight up from Melbourne on a full priced carrier). Staff were friendly, energetic and professional. Love the crocodile skin belts. A nice touch of the Northern Territory. The return leg from Dili left half an hour early. Ran out of food options early, but on an hour-long flight, you can cope.",,,,,
"  Darwin to Dili. The Embraer 170 seats 76 passengers, all in economy. Airnorth (the Australian, not the Canadian company!) runs regional services across northern Australia, including one international flight to Dili, the capital of Timor Leste (East Timor). It is the shortest international route flown out of Australia at 1 hr 20 minutes! Apart from magazines there is no IFE, but refreshments are served. Outwards from Darwin to Dili in the late afternoon it was a chicken wrap and soft drink; coming back at 8 am it was a light breakfast with tea or coffee. Leg room is fine (I am 178 cm tall) and the seats are comfortable for a short flight. Ground crew in Darwin and the cabin crew were cheerful and efficient. The check-in counter staff in Dili were efficient but not particularly cheerful - a minor point. This flight was booked on a special sale fare and was excellent value for money - normally the flights are a bit expensive.",,,,,
"Dili to Darwin. Please avoid Airnorth if possible when flying to and from Dili, Timor Leste. You would be better served to fly via Nam Air or Citilink via Bali. AirNorth was 3 hrs late today resulting in my young children missing their connecting flight in Darwin to Brisbane costing me $700 to purchase alternate connecting flight to Brisbane via JetStar. I called AirNorth Customer Service to only be chastised by the most rude Customer Service Representative in the world. She essentially said it was my fault for not anticipating the fact that AirNorth has a historically poor ""on-time"" schedule and it was my problem if I missed a connecting flight even though I had 3 hrs between flights (AirNorth was 3 hrs late so I missed the once daily Virgin Australia Flight from Darwin to Brisbane). ",,,,,
"Connecting Airnorth flight to PER via BME. Outbound flight delayed nearly 90 minutes as late departing from Darwin (the origin of this two stop flight). Connecting flight at Broome was held for transferring pax, bags made it through and were first off carousel at Perth. Very impressive that the flights were held, great service in this day and age. Onward flights to Perth with QF uneventful. Downside is that this regional airline charges unbelievably high fares on these routes - often in excess of an international long haul Y fare to Europe of North America, and far, far more than a comparable domestic ticket - there is no justification for the cost, except a virtual monopoly on these routes.",,,,,
"  Airnorth (Australian Airnorth that is) code-sharing with QantasLink has recently commenced a mostly daily non-stop service from the almost new Toowoomba-Wellcamp Airport to Melbourne (and also does a Toowoomba-Cairns run as well). I thought I'd give it a try for a business trip and was pleasantly surprised. Check-in is nicely efficient through the QantasLink staff, seating and also inflight service is pleasant except for the very annoying practice of loudly announcing the facilities etc on-board immediately after the aircraft has lifted off making for a very nerve racking experience - and I am a very frequent flyer who is never nervous. Forget the charm and excitement of the take-off experience. Why do some airlines do this these days? I had the same awful experience on a recent British Airways flight from Dubai to London. What a crazy idea. Also it is worth noting that Airnorth use Terminal 4 at Melbourne so don't make the mistake of thinking you can make a quick connection to regular Qantas or Qantaslink flights in Melbourne as these are in another terminal and quite a long walk awaits you from the Airnorth aircraft arrival gate across to the Qantas Terminal. The Qantas web-site and booking system does not seem to get that (yet). Apart from these 'teething troubles' I would cautiously recommend Airnorth.

",,,,,
"My experience on Airnorth was exceptional, with their super comfortable seats coupled with amazing service. The cabin crew were constantly doing rounds making sure we had everything we needed and serving us drinks, meals and even warm cookies! Our flight was not at all delayed, and our baggage was out for us in no time at all! I would definitely recommend this airline for anyone traveling in western Canada or Ottawa!",,,,,
"The Airnorth flight did not get off to a good start - having been delayed by an hour. Once in the air, service was efficient and effective. The in flight food was satisfactory. The seats are adequate, with sufficient pitch and recline to not cause any issues. The tickets were bought on special, giving good value for money.",,,,,
Had another wonderful flight from Whitehorse to Vancouver. Disappointed that's had to transit via Kelowna however. Makes a relatively short flight into a long one. I was also very disappointed in the agent boarding the aircraft. Very rude and poorly trained. First denied me boarding for invalid ID that's had used to board the Air North flight from Vancouver to Whitehorse. Another agent had to inform her my ID was valid and acceptable for travel. The flight attendants however were very attentive and defiantly made up for it all.,,,,,
Flew YVR-YXY-YVR. Flights both left on time and were pleasant and smooth. Flight Attendants were very friendly and helpful throughout the flight.,,,,,
I have to put in some severe criticism of Airnorth's customer service during the ash cloud disruption in June. My original morning flight on Sat 31 May Dili-Darwin was cancelled - fair enough. Airport staff thought it might operate in the afternoon and sent us home. The call centre told about midday that they hadn't decided what to do yet but would contact everyone later. About 3pm I got a call from the Qantas call centre to reschedule connecting flights and they saw in the system that Airnorth had rebooked me for 5pm Sunday. Then on Sunday morning I looked at Airnorth's website and it said that my 5pm flight had been changed to 12.45pm so I rushed off to the airport. It turned that was wrong and we were sent home. The call centre isn't open on Sundays so I had no idea what was happening. Eventually I saw on Darwin airport's website that the incoming fight had been cancelled (all other airlines operated normally from Dili and Darwin that afternoon). Airnorth eventually called at 7pm to tell me I was rescheduled for 5pm Monday. Normally Airnorth flights have been fine - on time good staff limited food but only short flights anyway. However they really can't handle anything unusual and given their monopoly on many routes they probably won't bother to improve.,,,,,
"Darwin to Kununurra in an E-170. Comfortable 2-abreast seating and a smooth flight. However there was a confusing beginning in Darwin as the departures screen said ""go to gate"" but did not give a gate number! Eventually a barely audible ""last call"" announcement was made. The service on-board was friendly. A pack of two small muffins and orange juice was served. The flight operated on time.",,,,,
DWN-TSV then GCA-DWN - April 2014. Flight down was direct on time and with good inflight service. Return flight via MT ISA less pleasing mainly because the FA's jammed us all together despite a number of rows of empty seats at the front of the plane. I hate having to ask to move once seated and with carry on in the o/head lockers. There was no need (that I can see) to stack us that way and it just left a bad taste in the mouth. Food on the return flights was similarly 'bad' in the mouth. 1st leg was a beef curry (very boarding school type muck) and 2nd leg described as a chicken wrap which turned out to be a beef wrap. Too bad if you were allergic and took a bite (surprise!).,,,,,
TSV-DRW-TSV: We chose to fly with Air North because of good connection flight times when returning from our overseas holiday. We arrived in Darwin at 4.50am after being in transit for 12 hrs from an overseas destination we were scheduled to fly back to Townsville on the 7.00am flight which was perfect. Air North changed the flight schedule our new departure time was 1.45pm. An increased wait of 6.45 hours at Darwin airport. I contacted Air North and inquired if any assistance could be given to us meal voucher half day accommodation etc. I received an email from the Marketing and Communications Manager who sighted their rules of carriage and provided us with details of a local motel for us to contact no assistance was offered not even a coffee voucher! We were very disappointed in Air Norths lack of customer care and would not recommend using Air North especially when connecting to/from International flights.,,,,,
TSV-DRW-TSV flight out on time the aircraft was clean and comfortable certainly more personal space on the Embraer 170 then you get on other economy flights in Australia. The cabin wasn't full so after take off it was a matter of grabbing a pair of seats to myself. A light morning meal of sandwiches water coffee/tea and a small chocolate was complimentary. The return flight was delayed 7 hours and advice was received about this the afternoon before by email and SMS. Two hot meal options offered on that flight one vegetarian the other sausages and mash. Beer wine and spirits were complimentary on this leg perhaps owing to the long delay I didn't ask I just enjoyed having two seats to myself again and kicked back with a fee Jim Beam and cola's. Flight attendants professional and attentive.,,,,,
Return DRW-DIL. Efficient boarding on-time helpful cabin attendants. Flight out provided minimal catering though this was a late afternoon flight. Return flight was early morning good breakfast akin to what I would normally have at home. In-flight magazine had really interesting articles and was adequate reading for the one hour flight. No complaints at all. No charge for exceeding baggage allowance by 1kg on return flight.,,,,,
Broome to Kununurra then Kununurra to Perth on ERJ 170. All flights on time fairly basic food but professional cabin service with 2 FA's keen to please. Seat rows are 2x2 and the seat pitch seems to be greater than economy in the newer 737's operated by Qantas mainline. A neat little aircraft. Love their direct service now three times between Perth and Kununurra - the only airline providing this service and also appreciate their 'milk runs' which allow easy connections several times a week between Karratha Port Hedland Broome Kununurra and Darwin. A dependable airline serving the remote bits of WA and other carriers could learn a lesson or two.,,,,,
Kununurra-Broome in an ERJ-170. A very pleasant flight. The seat pitch and light refreshments were fine for such a short leg. The seats have comfortable adjustable headrests. The service was friendly and the flight departed and arrived 20 minutes early.,,,,,
DPS-DRW on Embraer E170. This is a great little airline and a great little plane. Comfy seats with plenty of legroom free alcoholic drinks and a hot snack. They even served double drinks which is something I hadn't encountered in economy in a long time. Meal was a choice of hot meat or chicken pie plus cheese and crackers and a Twix. Service very friendly. Being such a small plane getting through immigration in Darwin was a breeze and the luggage was already on the belt when I got there. Customs was also easy. Unfortunately Airnorth are ceasing operations this route at the end of January 2009.,,,,,
"  They started by delaying the flight 3 hours. After everyone had checked in and the last flight from the airport left for the day, they cancelled the flight “due to weather”. Every other flight took off that day and there were other airlines flying to the same destination as this flight. They failed to reimburse costs for hotel room and car service to the airport. Next day the rescheduled flight was over an hour late. The fact that they lie to everyone about the reason for the cancel and take no responsibility for their incompetence has made it so I will never fly with them again. Take the ferry, it will save you time and a headache",,,,,
"  After I booked a flight from Manila to El Nido, I read a slew of bad reviews regarding last minute cancellations that are common with this airline. And that was concerning to me, but what could I do at that point? Sure as heck, 24 hours before my flight from Manila was supposed to depart, I received an email from Airswift saying my flight was cancelled due to maintenance issues as well. If you choose to go to Palawan, I would choose any other airline than AirSWIFT even if it means a long bus ride to El Nido.",,,,,
"  Caticlan to El Nido in ATR 42-600. They rolled a carpet from to the plane to enter and exit. Good service in flight, on time flight and greeted with umbrellas from the plane to the arrival hall of the airport to avoid the hot sun in El Nido. 10 plus for this flight.",,,,,
"  Manila to El Nido. AirSWIFT is a Philippine boutique airline offering daily roundtrip flights from Manila to El Nido. And this is the only way to go to El Nido. If you book any property of the El Nido Resorts, you would get a discount on its flight. And there is also a VIP lounge for guests of El Nido Resorts in the airport. They fly AT4, a very old plane. Do not expect to have much service in this short one hour ride. Of course also no any entertainment. But the crews and ground staff are friendly.",,,,,
 Do not recommend. Have been multiple flights with this airline and always delayed. Do not have sufficient flights to operate causing delays. Also seats are uncomfortable. Mostly getting booked due to low prices but go for IndiGo.,,,,,
" We booked this airline through an online agent and when we were at the airport to check in, the staff at the desk told us that flight was cancelled and moved us to other flight. Without notifications email or SMS from airline or agent. It was very terrible if we knew in advance then we could manage our plan or buy a new flight earlier. So this caused us to buy a new tickets with Indigo at very expensive price. I don't recommend to risk your plan with this airline",,,,,
  I was travelling from Ahmedabad to Mumbai and I found Priyanshi at the service window. Can’t expect a better service than that. She is a super enthusiastic personal with a charming personality. She have helped to get me on board on-time. I would have missed the flight without her presence. ,,,,,
  Although the aircrafts are new and inside decor is set in vibrant colors the moment you step into the cabin you feel something is missing. The crew with the exception of the male steward neither looked welcoming not hospitable. They seemed to be going through the motions and there was no warmth in their demeanour.. I traveled with family from Bangalore to Mopa airport in Goa On 6th Jul. There was another problem with this airline. They accepted bookings for a flight that they didn't operate. They choose to put me on an earlier flight QP1392 instead of QP1398. I incurred an additional charge for the return flight with another airline since they informed on their only 2 weeks ahead of departure. Highly unethical for them to accept bookings in such manner. The 4 in my rating is more for the equipment and airfare. Neither their website nor helpline nor ground staff pass the muster.,,,,,
"  The flight stewards were very rude and unprofessional in Akasa Air. In my last flight from Bangalore to Guwahati, the steward behaved unprofessionally and was rude as I walked down the aisle slow and didn’t rush wile boarding and on being called out, he was absolutely unapologetic about his behaviour. I was in sudden shock and at first didn’t realise what went wrong for him to behave like that. This kind of behaviour isn’t acceptable.",,,,,
"  Akasa Air cancelled a flight Visakhapatnam to Bengaluru without notifying customers, resulting in a loss of INR 21,000 when booking last-minute tickets. Avoid Akasa Air, they don’t have required infrastructure to operate, they don’t have messaging system to notify passengers, neither they email. They appear to be customer-centric on social media, but when you email them, they never respond.",,,,,
"  When the crew assistance button is pushed the crew came to my seat almost 3-4 minutes later. There were children sitting in emergency exit bays both in row 15 and in 16, though they were made to sit in some other seat while take off and landing. The crew seems to be more interested in making money than to assist. Unreasonably expensive seat cost. I had to pay 20000 INR as it was urgent. While doing web check in there was no option to auto seat select and was forced to book exit bay seats with paying additional 1400 INR and this felt like a scam, why because there were passengers at last moment that were sitting in some other seats and were allowed to sit in the seats for which I paid extra. Also at last moment some passengers were asked to sit in the seats that I paid extra for and it doesn't seems like that's their seat as no seat number verification was done. ",,,,,
"  One of the worst airlines I have ever dealt with. They cancel the flight to  Visakhapatnam segment and give me a notice 2 weeks prior to travel. I planned and bought the ticket 3 months back and now the ticket is 4 times higher than what I bought it for. They should have given at least a month advance notice. No customer empathy. And when I speak to the rep, he feels he is doing a favor by issuing a refund. And asks me to contact the portal I booked ticket for refund money. ",,,,,
" They cancelled my flight on 27 May 2023 and didn't inform me at all. When I reached Ahmedabad airport they didn't allow me to check in. Then they told me about cancellation of my flight. They offered me a flight the next day. I asked for accommodation and meal along with the compensation in accordance with CAR, section 3, Series M, Part IV of DGCA rule and regulations, but they denied to give, they only offered compensation within 7 days. I had to return in 45 degree hot temperature of Ahmedabad towards 2 hour journey to hotel which cost me 2500 per day and 1000 cab fare. All my plans were cancelled due to this. Today it is 06 June 2023 but still I haven't received my compensation.",,,,,
  Never try this airline. Akasa Air ground staff and customer support is not good. No one can help in airport. My life bad experience in this airline. Everyone just blamed to other..no one help. I have no words for this airline how can describe my problem here. It almost three months completed but at the moment no one help me.,,,,,
  Horrible experience with Akasa. They rescheduled both my flights. One flight was at 20:15 but was moved to 00:20 and the other from 18:30 to 07:50. Worst airline ever. They give a customer care number but I was never able to connect as the operators were always busy. And currently they are making a fuss over the refund as they are supposed to refund the entire amount if flight is rescheduled by more than 2 hours. I would recommend any other airline but not this.,,,,,
" We have booked total 3 tickets (windows). My only concern is our seats have been changed without informing or asking us. Later when we asked for the reason they made us to wait for few minutes and a senior guy came with new boarding pass and started yelling that he never seen passengers like us. His point was “I gave you a Business class (3 seats in a row) and why don’t you want it. My point is ""we don’t care about class why we want windows seat of our actually paid seats“ the conversation ended with his words telling “I never seen passenger like you“ Me telling “well, you have seen now“ even at last moment I got a window in economy class which is two rows behind my actual seats. Very lame of the kind of response which he have bottom line : everyone don’t ask for business class. It’s their responsibility to make sure passengers get the seats which they have booked and if there is some conflict they should let the passengers know before changing it",,,,,
"  This was my second flight of Akasa. 1st flight was okay. But this time it was lot of inconvenience. I didn't get boarding pass till I reached airport due to some technical hitch. While check in option online, Akasa displays list of names of all passengers along with their boarding pass which I think is not a good practice and security of passengers should be respected. Why should one know names of people travelling. Overall experience bad and security of passengers very very bad.",,,,,
  The worst airline and service! I have booked for the first time and this is the worst decision ever. I booked five tickets for me and my family including two senior citizens. All five of us were allotted with different seats and that too in the middle ones. If that’s not cruel and unethical then what it is? We started our mini vacation with a very happy note but alas the Akasa Air has ruined in the final note! ,,,,,
  One of the worst experiences. Gate change from what was sent via first message to the one at airport was not announced or message was not resent - we had to figure out at the airport. Inflight experience was pathetic. I was seated in row 15D - The inflight attendant was not clear on emergency row - she started explain the emergency procedure to row 12 customer when the emergency rows were 15 & 16. I had inflight meal prebooked - none of the flight attendants bother to ask for servicing the same - when I asked for the same - captain announce landing - so I was not served my pre booked meal. I paid for the same but get the same on board,,,,,
 Overall a good experience than previous flights I have gone through. Perfect service management and on-time management. I would rate it a 5 star flight for economy class,,,,,
 The flight was completely comfortable and the food served from Café Akasa was very appetizing. Lovely in-flight experience! The cabin crew was absolutely humble and polite and addressed to every passenger with utmost patience. Very happy with my experience!,,,,,
  Definitely will fly again. Today  first time i travelled in this airline. Was provided premium seats which are wide enough & there is less crowd at counter check & the behaviour of staff are really polite. Also they serve nice food. I am really satisfied with Akasa Air. ,,,,,
  The staff are very rude and I don’t understand being new airline why this people don’t hire such good trained people. No welcome and such bad behaviour. Even for amount more weight they charge like anything even if you don’t have hand bags. In comparison to IndiG0 or Vistara or go first they have to improve a lot to reach to their level. Very disappointed with this airline.,,,,,
"  I was disappointed with the staff at the counter check In at Delhi airport. However, their manager was very cooperative and helped me with my seat assignment. I was treated well by the in flight attendant and was met with all requirements. The take off and landing was very smooth. Baggage clearance was smooth. Just the check in free seats availability should be improvised and worked on: Pls keep all seats available for everyone who has booked tickets as you guys want to be an airline with a tag - affordable for all. Pls don’t charge unnecessarily on extra baggage and seats .",,,,,
"  Air Akasa will weigh every single thing you have and then charge you. Per kg extra baggage charges are 550, too much and they call themselves affordable. Never fly with this airline, staff behaviour is not good.",,,,,
  Pleasant journey with Akasa. Their cabin service is good and travel was on time. They crew did a decent job of keeping everyone comfortable. Will recommend others to try.,,,,,
 This is our first flight on Akasa Air and right from check in to boarding it just was efficient and smooth. The staff are friendly and accommodating. Aircraft was new clean and smelt fresh. Would definitely fly this new airline and wish them all the best.,,,,,
"  I arrived at the new beautiful North Goa airport and headed to check in counter.  Long queues for the various airlines but no one was in the Akasa queue. I approached smiling customer service representatives who took my two pieces of luggage (I had prepaid for 15 kg extra luggage because I was flying internationally,) They weighed them , handed me my boarding pass and said have a nice flight. I have never experienced such an easy check in. Boarding was seamless. They boarded back of the plane first.  Plane was full, but didn't take long to board. The plane was impeccably spotless and spacious.  Would definitely fly with them again. It took literally one hour from my house, to the airport, thru check in and security, and to the terminal!",,,,,
" I can not thank Akasa Air enough. They helped me as I was travelling with an infant and I forgot my laptop and mobile bag check as my kid is a handful and I remembered when it was take-off time, entire crew worked as one and ensured I received my laptop and mobile and also ensured I don't have to miss the flight. Though it got delayed a bit because of me they waited and on the top of that they also landed the flight in BLR before time. So kudos. I will recommend more than 100%. ",,,,,
"  This was my second trip with Akasa and I enjoyed the flight and overall experience from Check in to Cabin services to meals. We landed before time which was great, the best part about Akasa is their amazing cheap flexi fares.",,,,,
" Akasa is fairly new to the Indian aviation however I loved their services from ground staff to the onboard Cabin Crew. Akasa being an LCC has the best fares including their flexi fares which I found the best thing about flying with them comparison to other Low cost airlines. I had pre booked a meal which was a special ""Holi Festive Meal"" it tasted good and was fresh. A choice of complimentary beverage was also included in the fare which was nice. Also another great thing was the free water bottle which is nothing but a dream onboard many other LCCs like Air Asia where they charge even for a bottle of water so I do appreciate Akasa Air for this. Also the Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft was very comfortable with wider windows and great interior mood lighting. Overall a great flight which despite taking off late arrived before time and I would love to fly Akasa again!",,,,,
"  We had a great experience with Akasa Air. Customer service, especially from ground staff in Agartala was exceptional. Check in and boarding was quick and easy, the flight left and arrived on time, our seats were comfortable and we had a great flight.",,,,,
" I travelled many airlines (Air Asia, IndiGo, Akasa) on my recent India trip. Akasa Airlines is miles ahead in Customer service at Airport, Customer Service Call Centre. Very new, comfortable seating and facilities in flight. Flight take-off and landing is also very good, didn't feel that we had landed. Keep up the great work, within no time you'll be India's best airline. ",,,,,
"  Very happy with Akasa Air services. This is the 2nd time I've flown from Agartala to Guwahati and vice versa and was happy to note that both ground and onboard staff were helpful, courteous and well trained and maintained their standards. They had ontime departure and the aircraft was clean and seemed new. I would fly it again.",,,,,
"  We just had the worst experience with Akasa airlines. We had booked a flight from Mumbai to Kochi with 5 hours layover in Bangalore. To start with the flight was late to start from Mumbai and thus arrived late in Bangalore. We had 5 hours transit time in Bangalore , so we were hanging out in the airport lounge. But they preponed the flight from Bangalore without any prior information. Obviously we didn't knew about this and missed the flight. Later when we spoke with manager and other staffs of the airlines, they handled the situation quite unprofessionaly and Irresponsibly. As we were transit passengers no airlines can take of the flight without transit passengers. They didn't make any effort at all to get in touch with us initially to inform about the change in the timing and later for boarding the flight. Anyways even after talking with then for a total of two hours they didn't provide us with any suitable alternative options.  We had to book hotel and take a later flight on the same day after 12 hours. The money for hotels, transport and food was just a waste from our side to clearly a mistake from their side. I am writing this review sitting in the above said Bangalore to kochi flight and it's delayed. ",,,,,
"  I had worst experience with Akasa Air. My flight was supposed to be at 12.50pm but when I reached airport to know that it has been already departed at 7am in the morning, I did not receive any call or message regarding that. I later on checked for any messages that I might have received but I had no message from akasa or goibibo from where we had booked our flight. Now the next flight is at 9.45pm, and we have booked a hotel For 1500 and 2 times meal. ",,,,,
" It was a wonderful experience overall, crew members are very helpful, every time they assisted us with a warm smile, have ever ever felt such a kind of special assistance.",,,,,
"  Took the flight from Bangalore to Kochi and back. This was my first trip on Akasa. I was impressed with their efficiency, punctuality, courteous and friendly staff and clean flights. The flight landed early both ways.",,,,,
"  On time, clean, spacious and comfortable seating. One of the lowest fare, very courteous staff, offered free water and was very friendly. ",,,,,
 Worst airline. Don't opt for it. Airline delays by 1 hour minimum. Unprofessional and unaware staff. Advise never to opt got it and book other airlines instead.,,,,,
  My first flight with Akasa Air was a nightmare. Airport staff is ignorant about flight which had already landed. Bus brought us to a flight destined for Ahmadabad and we waited for 30 minutes after we were asked to reboard the bus to reach flight for Lucknow. Airport staff need to be trained. Akasa operation vendors seems to be cheap and airline managers are careless. I do not recommend Akasa Air.,,,,,
"  New Boeing 737 Max aircraft, spacious cabin, great leg room. Some aircraft that akasa air uses are ex Jet Airways aircraft that have ample leg room. Akasa cafe is excellent, Checkin was hassle free as i had selected my seat and web check a day earlier prior to my travel. Crew was polite and helpful. USB chargers for mobiles are given in every seat,",,,,,
"  Booked a flight from Akasa air for only one reason, time of travel was matching as per my work schedule. Writing this review while I’m boarded and wondering why isn’t this flight not taking off. Delayed by 60 minutes, remind you this 60 mins of delay is just to get you inside aircraft, then another 20minutes and going on as I’m writing this review. No announcements from captain or cabin crew stating the reason for delay even after being boarded and boarding is completed. Would never recommend any to fly Akasa. Been a great fan of indigo since many years, don’t remember single flight being delayed while on journey almost every month since last 4 years.",,,,,
"  It was my first flight journey from Mumbai to Bangalore. Thank you Akasa air teams for smooth check in , enjoyed my first flight. Overall it was a great journey for me.",,,,,
 Very bad. They don't even have baggage counters. Arrived airport 4 hrs prior to departure time and we had to wait till 1.5 hrs before departure time. They did baggage and quick check in at the last minute in a hurried manner. Had to run with wife,,,,,
" I travelled from Bangalore to Visakhapatnam with my 2 kids. What could have ended up in a travel disaster was quickly turned around by the ground staff into a memorable trip. While the flight was comfortable, check-in during the peak hours airport rush took me for a ride. With kids I arrived a bit late and the counter was closed. The ground/check-in staff found an opportunity to fit us in and they did the unthinkable. Everything happened with lightning speed and we were on the flight finally with few mins to spare. I really appreciate their hard work and very thankful for the VIP treatment. Although, the baggage arrived a bit late , Its not a big concern at all. I really wish them all the success and growth in their future endeavours.",,,,,
"  LCC currently operating only on domestic route. Have all Boeing 737 Max fleet. Seats are just ok for short 1-2 hr flights, can't expect more from a budget carrier. Boarding was systematic and smooth, cabin was clean and fresh, cabin crew were courteous. Departed and arrived on time. Ticket price is competitive. No major reason to avoid.",,,,,
"  Akasa is removing whatever little dignity was left in low cost air travel (despite not being so low cost). They will fret over every last kilogram in your luggage and make you transfer stuff around and between luggages just to harrass customers as it clearly serves no practical purpose. Terrible boarding and check in process! The staff is untrained, uncoordinated and clueless.",,,,,
  Such a worst experience. My advise people don't book this flight. Nobody bother to address the queries. Not even helping for boarding pass. No early check in baggage facilities. We need to wait till an hour before your boarding. You can't go to Lounge due to this. They don't have kiosk facilities also for boarding pass. So we need to wait till counter opens. Never ever i book again in Akasa Air.,,,,,
" It was my 1st time to fly Akasa Air and was quite sceptical about it since I had read so many negative reviews about the airline. But the experience I got even before boarding the airline till I landed was exceptionally good. Customer helpline operators were really polite, well behaved and really helpful. Flight was on time, no hassle there. The staff were really good. The aircraft, a Boeing 747 was really clean and the inside of it was really colorful and pleasant to look at. The seats were also comfortable with ample leg space for a tall guy like me. The cabin crew members were also very helpful and didn't make a fuss about anything. So overall, the whole experience was positive and made me a happy and a satisfied person. I have absolutely no doubt to fly Akasa Boeing again and I would definitely recommend this airline to everybody. Thanks Akasa for a wonderful experience! (I didn't order any food or beverages and never used the wifi so wouldn't be giving any rating for that).",,,,,
"  Firstly the flight was delayed by one hour and then when you are in the flight some kind of polite behaviour is required from the staff. Air hostess was very rude when I asked her to help with my luggage. She said that ""we are not here to pick up luggage of people"". Working with the service industry and answering in this manner to your customer is just not acceptable.",,,,,
" Never be flying with 'Akasa Air' again I am a frequent traveller and the experience below is my worse airline experience so far! We booked 2 tickets (different PNR), one was on my name - Ashima Arora and the other was on my husbands name - Nishan Singh. My infant ticket was attached to my husbands PNR. My husband couldn't travel because of some personal reasons. We (Myself and My infant) reached the Akasa Air counter on time (10am it was and the flight was at 11am), my boarding pass was also printed but when the staff realized that my infant was added in a different PNR, he asked me to wait and tried calling the supervisor/manager to check what needs to be done in this case. I was standing there for 30 minutes and constantly reminding the staff about the moving clock. However, he assured me that I need not worry as they'll have me onboard. After 30 minutes at 10:30am, the staff told me that I need to pay Rs1500 to move my child's name in my PNR number from my husbands PNR. I tried to find out the real reason behind the charges as there are airlines that do not charge for it if it has to be from one parent to another parent. It was 10:32am. I took 1 minute to absorb those charges and told the counter staff that I'll pay as I want to board that flight. It was 10:33am. He called someone again (I believe it was a supervisor standing on the boarding gate) in front of me that the passenger was ready to pay now, but the person on the other side refused to take the payment and have us board the flight. So, the staff took 30 minutes to inform me about the next step but did not spare even 3 minutes of time to let me absorb those extra charges I had to pay (for PNR move). We were left there and couldn't board that flight. I waited for the supervisor/manager for another 1 hour and 30 minutes but no one showed up even the staff informed them that the passenger was waiting. I was left with no other choice and I reached out to the airport authority with the concern. When the staff of airport authority accompanied me, only then the supervisor showed up. He started giving some lame excuses that I was already late for the flight at 10:30am and I reached late to the airport. Since they have very less number of flights operational and haven't even tied up with any other airline, they could only place me in the next day flight. And now, I had to pay Rs1500 for moving the infant's name and Rs2000 extra to secure my seat for the next day. And these charges were for one-side travel. Similarly, for the way back from Kochi to BNG I again paid Rs1500 for the infant. I actually had to pay double i.e. Rs6000 which is higher than my ticket's original price for my infant. And additionally Rs2000 more for my ticket too. Spent around 14 hours in the airport with my infant. Lost a day of hotel booking charges too since we were flying for holidays and the holiday package was already booked. When I wrote this concern to their customer support, initially I started getting response with as if I have connected to the wrong team with the concern. After writing to then a number of times, I got a response saying that all fault was of us as passengers and thus, they can't help in any which means without letting me know their source of collecting the facts or the information. The resistance was very clear in the emails I received from the customer care too.",,,,,
" I travelled twice within a span of three weeks. Positives: - Inflight service is good - Staff is courteous in flight - Baggage comes on time. Negatives: - Boarding is entire chaos, they dont know how to even organise boarding from gate. - Flight is divided into zones where zone 2,3 and 4 can board early to avoid congestion but no one announces this! Check in staff horrendous - I specifically asked for my paintings to be put the Fragile tag but they didn't put it with the result one of them was destroyed.",,,,,
"  I don't know where to start, this airline is always late. Akasa is undoubtedly known for the delays it causes, mainly by a few hours and sometimes even almost a day. Akasa gave 1 hour time before the departure, as its boarding time, which is atrocious. Today, I was on the way to the airport, when I received a last moment notification stating the delay of my flight QP 1314 by an hour, which was still okay at that point. The madness began when I reached the airport and was lined in the queue for checking in my luggage when the Akasa employees started pulling out other passengers from another flight that had begun boarding. On finally reaching the counters after over half an hour, the ground staff refused to take my luggage as the Departure time was 3.30 pm after the delay, and the ""boarding"" mentioned by them was 2.30 pm and the time was 2.32 pm. They refused the baggage, and I had to run through security with 15kg of luggage, which had 2 bottles of alcohol. Upon finally reaching the gate, the flight was mentioned delayed again. The boarding did not start before 3.20 pm. ",,,,,
"  Newest of all Indian airlines, started just 2 months back. Another LCC, ticket price competitive, boarding was smooth. Flight was on time. Seats just ok as per LCC standard, cabin was clean and hygienic, cabin crew courteous.",,,,,
" Never again! My ticket was messed up, I had to take a later flight and sit in the airport for 3 hours, replacement flight was in main cabin when I paid for 1st class, and the plane was SO DISGUSTING. The carpet was so dirty and sticky, it it pulled my shoe off. I cant believe this airline operates this way.",,,,,
"  Booked a round trip with this company for a family ER. First flight crew was great. Returning Flight I had an altercation with their senior flight attendant who had a disgusting behavior and escalated a situation that could've easily been handled by proper customer service and communication. I approached her and another flight attendant to use the restrooms when it was last call for restrooms use. I was coldly told by both to use the back restrooms where there was a huge line. I explained that I was in a hurry to use it since I've been holding my son who's been asleep the majority of the flight. She said someone was in there. I was aware and asked if I could use it afterwards, the flight attendant seated next to her said ""Yes"" then the senior flight attendant said to me: Maybe if you ask with less attitude you can go in there. Surprised by her response I tell her I did not give her attitude and that she did not need to speak that way and it is true because I did not yell or curse anyone out and even I supposedly gave you attitude, Aren't you trained to handle this in a proper way maybe by communicating with the customer? No, she stood up aggressively, got in my face and started telling me out loud in front of customers that she will not tolerate me to speak with her that way, that I won't be using the restrooms and to take a seat. Sounds pretty personal at this point! Her reaction was unnecessary and all she did is escalate a little restroom situation to where I started yelling at her and pointing out her disgusting behavior. At this point she kept asking me to take a seat and I couldn't because who will take a seat after being spoken to the way she did? Someone without dignity for sure. At this point there's a lot of back and forth going on between us and she then tells me that I will be considered a threat and she will call authorities if I don't take a seat. She was a threat to me by the way she stood up and got in my face and no one in their right mind will tolerate that. At some point I take a seat after my partner comes to calm the situation, I asked her to call authorities. We finally land, authorities are there, my family and I are the first to get out of the plane. The lady that works for authorities asked for my version which I gave and she said that the FA told them that she asked me to take a seat and wait right after I asked to use the restrooms which is false. If you have the audacity to escalate a situation and be disrespectful at least have the audacity to be truthful too.",,,,,
"  No in flight entertainment. Inconvenient food ordering system that has to be done in advance. People who had flight delays/changes with kids and planned to get food in the airport were at risk of having no food available because of the limited amount they had for those who didn’t order in advance. My flights were either extremely hot or extremely cold. The first class seating had broken charging ports that had coffee spills on them. Stewardess simply said 3 of the first class chargers are broken (out of 8?), so the two of us in my row are out of luck. The tray between the two first class seats was just gross. Dirty. The ticket counter was absolute chaos both on the way here and on the way back. Half of the self serve baggage tag printers were out of paper resulting in long lines, and lots of anxious customers. I don’t get it. I wouldn’t normally add a review if I thought my experience was an isolated one but there seems to be a lot of shortfalls all over the place with this airline.",,,,,
"  Absolutely terrible experience flying with Alaska. First of all, I’m still on the plane, it is extremely hot on here, and has been since we all loaded. There are no TV’s on the back of the seats like most up to date airlines have. The isles are so small you can’t walk to the bathroom because there’s almost always someone else in the isle already. I paid extra to sit behind first class in the premium seats but the perks that I paid extra for are non existent. I hit the assistance button to have a drink brought to me, but the stewardess told me to walk to the back of the plane if I want a drink. Also, the stewardess is extremely rude, she clearly hates her job and is not welcoming. I asked for milk for my daughter and she said they don’t have milk. How do you carry sodas and juice and all the alcohol but not milk?! We’re going to try and switch our flight with another airline for the flight home because Alaska is so ancient and has been such a let down. Do not recommend. Oh and my seat doesn’t recline. I’m in premium seating, it should recline. My husbands chair reclines but mine is broken I guess. Also, we struggled but managed to put our daughters car seat in the airline seat and we got her buckled up and then at take off they decided to tell us she needed to be in the window seat with a car seat -why wouldn’t you tell us that during boarding?",,,,,
 We were on a connecting flight to London and the pilot had no sense of urgency to give us updates on flight when we sat in the taxi like for an hour. We were 2 minutes late to our American flight and they still wouldn’t let us in either. Cabin crew was great but pilot screwed us and American Airlines screwed us too.,,,,,
"  After 3 weeks of visiting my family in Washington, two of my children were returning to Texas today unaccompanied. My wife's and my names were added to the unaccompanied minor packet, however, the desk agent only added my wife's name into the system, preventing me from being able to get a security pass to meet them at the gate. The ticket agents at DFW airport told us of the error, but made no effort to attempt to find a way to rectify the situation or even show a basic level of human empathy. They said it was the fault of the SeaTac branch and was not their problem. They refused to take any company blame and instead continually tried to push off responsibility and without making any effort to solve a problem. I understand the original problem was created by the SeaTac ticket agent, and they need better training and attention to derail, but the lack of even average customer service at DFW ticket counter really irks me as with just minimal effort on their part, I would at least not be writing poor reviews about Alaskan Airlines. I did file a complaint directly with their company, but after seeing the way they Alaskan's employees represent this airline, I will be looking at taking my business to their competitors in the future. Don’t fly with Alaskan Airlines, their airport employees do not care about their customers.",,,,,
" My partner and I were traveling from Seattle back home to San Francisco on 7/16/2023, and I purposefully purchased an earlier flight from Seattle as we were traveling on a Sunday and both of us had work the following morning. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 3:55 PM and was to land at SFO by 6:08 PM. First red flag: Alaska Airlines changed the gate to a completely different part of Seattle's airport last minute. Extremely inconvenient as this was done very close to the alleged boarding time, and Seattle's airport is massive and required several train transfers to reach the new gate. Second red flag: delays without any information. First the flight was delayed from 3:55 PM to 5:02 PM, but no information as to why. Then, the flight was delayed to 6 PM, again no information as to why. Then, 7:40.... 8:10....9:00....9:40....10:00....we finally departed at 10:19 PM (a 6 hour delay) as our airplane was broken and a crew was repairing it for hours. It took over 3 departure time changes for anyone to tell us what was going on, and the Alaskan Airlines representatives were basically unsure as to if we would even be leaving that day as it was ""all up in the air"". Why was there no back up airplane? Why not take an airplane that was scheduled to depart much later in the day/night, and have that flight then use our airplane that was being repaired? Alaska Airlines thought they could mend things by giving us each $100 flight credit to be used for a future flight (which will go to waste as I will never fly with Alaska Airlines again) as well as $24 meal vouchers per person, which if anyone knows the price of airport food then that's enough for maybe 1 sandwich and a drink. Worst flight experience of my life, never again will I fly with Alaska Airlines or recommend Alaska Airlines to friends/family.",,,,,
" This was my first time flying with Alaska Airlines and I cannot say enough good things. I could not get into the States from Canada to get my flight because I didn't have the ESTA, my kids and husband didn't need one because they are Canadian. We decided they should go ahead and I would wait and fly as soon as I received it. I called Alaska Airlines and they were amazing, no wait to talk to someone, and allowed me to change my flight as needed and only pay the difference. They did not have to do anything to help me really, as my ticket was one of the cheaper options. Once I got the document I needed three days later they got me on the next flight available. Every member of staff I talked with was so polite and professional. The flights went on time and arrived early. I have flown quite a lot in the past and have never been as impressed as I was with Alaska Airlines and I will go out of my way to fly with them again, even though there are usually other options that work better for me flying from Canada. I really don't understand why their rating is not higher.",,,,,
 Rude people on the phone refuse to supply info needed for flight such as gate and if any delays. No agent at ticket counter in Atlanta and phone agents said they couldn’t help. Very rude gate agents. It’s like this airline does not like it’s customers. Use another airline.,,,,,
"  Alaska Airlines in my opinion is one of the worst airlines I have ever flown. I was on a 5 hour flight and they don't provide you with a meal. They barely give you a snack. I couldn't get any streaming or even texting capabilities unless I wanted to purchase it for $8.00. Or if I was a member of team mobile! On each flight, they are lacking in overhead luggage space so they ask anyone wanting to check a bag will get the ability to get on the plane in group C. So much of an advantage. They don't seem to take the time to clean the aircraft in-between flights. They barely give you the included beverage. They have no in-flight movies unless you have your own mobile device which I couldn't use for their 700 free movies because I couldn't get into it without paying for streaming, but I was able to get into their commercial. They don't have enough space overhead, but if you don't bring on your own device, you are sitting there with nothing to do for 5 hours because you can't get it on your phone. In fact being on the plane is like one big commercial. They ask you if you want to open up their credit card and all the wonderful things you will get after you accrue 30,000 miles. Then the final thing, your luggage will be there in 20 minutes or we will give you some air miles. I will not be flying Alaska Airlines and they can keep your air miles and their nickel and dimming and in my opinion elitest practices. ",,,,,
"  Just went to book Psp to Sfo. At the end of the long process, Alaska Airlines informed me that my seats were no longer available. They made me start completely over, could not just start me in the seating chart. When I got to seats, my seats were still available. But my fare was about a 3rd more expensive. This is flat dishonest. I used to fly even more often. Alaska used to be the best airline. All of the new nickle and diming and inflexibility and now dishonest fare tactics; management has clearly changed. I will not be choosing Alaska Airlines over more honest airlines again.",,,,,
"  
Due to flight cancellations and inability get a standby flight to YVR on United, I chose to fly to Seattle to get closer to Vancouver. The 737 MAX 9 is a very comfortable aircraft with plenty of legroom in Economy Class. Flight crew as friendly and provided the usual refreshments and snacks. If Alaska Airlines had more flights from DFW I would not hesitate to fly it again.",,,,,
"  Arrived at Dulles and had to declare a firearm in my checked baggage. AA employee Sahira assisted me and she was training at least 8 new employees. She was efficient, pleasant and quick even while training. My bag was unintentionally put on the conveyor before it was X-rayed by TSA. Sahira and the entire group disappeared and retrieved the bag in only 15 minutes and helped us finish our processing through TSA. The entire group of new employees were eager and happy and it was the best airport experience I’ve had in years. A great job by all especially Sahira! She is a credit to Alaska Airlines.",,,,,
"  My wife and I have exclusively used Alaska Airlines for the past 15 years with great satisfaction. On the last trip in June we found they have changed! They no longer provide even adequate service but don’t care for their customers in the least and will lie when they get caught in bad service. I have 150,000 miles and my wife has 124,000 miles Both Elite and MVP customers. But they treated us poorly, didn’t care that we fly first class or anything, I was actually threatened by a gate agent supervisor and her supervisor. Customer Service didn’t care less and just ignored us. They have changed for the worst.",,,,,
  An almost 2hr delay with super clear skies because of their own reasons: delayed arrival of airplane and then waiting 50 min in the plain to get a lane to fly.,,,,,
"  This is my second review. When I was finally able to reach an Alaska Airlines representative by phone and explain the situation, I learned that there was no unaccompanied minor status applied to our child when the reservation was made by phone, contrary to what my husband was told by the airline representative at the time of purchase. I was informed when I was making my complaint that unaccompanied minor status was only paid for and applied at time of check in. Why didn’t the phone representative inform my husband when he placed the reservation? I also learned Alaska Airlines is focused on money more than a minor’s safety. I explained that I had been allowed to accompany my child to the gate for the departing flight and the supervisor I was speaking to exclaimed, “And she didn’t charge you!” I would not have expected to be charged just as I did not expect to fill out a form during check-in because we believed we had paid it as part of the rather expensive ticket we already paid. The supervisor criticized me for not searching out this information on the website. We believed everything was taken care of because we had Spoken to Alaska airline representatives, both when we made the reservation and during check-in. Apparently representative’s words cannot be trusted. Because of the lack of competency on the part of Alaska airlines, our minor child was not met by the guardian at the gate upon arrival. The guardian was not allowed to accompany our minor child through security on the return flight, and was not present as guardian and witness when our minor child was searched all around their privates by TSA. Because of Alaska airlines incompetency, I was not allowed to meet my own child at the gate. If I had not directly asked the representative what was required when I was denied a gate pass, I never we would have even heard about the “yellow form “. Alaska Airlines is worse than the Keystone cops and I do not recommend this airline to anyone.",,,,,
" Gate check in was short staffed and not overly helpful. In fairness it was a full flight and they looked busy. Flight Crew was a different story, they were beyond amazing! Thomas, Becca and the other 2 attendants were all so kind, and helpful. There was a medical emergency on the flight and all of them worked together to provide support. I have so much respect for the crew and Alaska is my airline of choice!",,,,,
"  Our luggage is lost. It was supposed to come on next flight and be delivered to us last night or else by 9am this morning. There is still no sign of it and absolutely no communication from the airline. The phone number I was given is not working. They are not responding to my emails. We have a six day holiday in San Diego and the first day is already destroyed. Well done Air Alaska. Also, they were ""left short"" on restocking so the only refreshment we received on our flight was a 250ml carton of water that tasted vile. A relatively minor complaint but another example of lack of concern or regard for customers. Zero marks for customer care.",,,,,
" I am not impressed at all with the staff, convenience, or customer service. I booked a cruise and I booked the flights to and from through Air to Sea. I was supposed to be on first class because I am clausty and have a terrible fear of flying. I realized I was not booked correctly. I reached out to Air to Sea and they said no problem, just download the apps and change seats. On my flight there I was booked on American Airlines. I went on the app, easily upgraded to first class, the staff was super helpful, and they even upgraded my entire family for free! The flight was comfy, the staff on the plane were great, and I had zero panic attacks. Not the same experience with Alaska Airlines. They would not help me. They told me we had plenty up upgrades available and it was a small fee to upgrade. Then the staff said never mind we can't help you because you went through Air to Sea. So we called Air to Sea that said they can't help because the airline does not allow them to see first class. After going back and forth we got both sides on the phone at the same time where Alaska Airlines said they would upgrade us for over $1,000 a ticket! Wow. Horrible customer service, very petty because we booked through Air to Sea, treated us terrible like we had done something wrong, not to mention plenty of seating they are refusing to sell us. They should be ashamed and they reminded me of why I will always be loyal to American Airlines!",,,,,
  They damaged a brand new bag I checked in at Kahului and I cannot use the telescopic handle any more. When I pointed this out to their representative Val at Seattle Airport he told me I wasn't entitled to any compensation. After an overnight flight I was too tired to push my case and accepted what he said. But when I arrived at my hotel and emptied the bag to check the mechanism I discovered the mechanism at the bottom of the suitcase bent which has now jammed the handle making it useless. This is obviously from damage from poor handling. Their web site freezes regularly and there is no way to even send them a message to claim compensation or take this matter further. Having flown Hawaiian Airlines to many islands in Hawaii and enjoying the warm and genuine friendly and cheerful staff on Hawaiian it was a stark contrast traveling with Alaska Airlines for the first time. Whereas the flight attendants on Hawaiian greet every passenger when boarding my wife and I noticed that he Flight Attendants on Alsaka were too busy talking to each other when we boarded to even greet us! Service on board was also very indifferent and you got the feeling they were just going through the motions until the aircraft got to its destination. Disappointing first experience and maybe no more!,,,,,
"  My 87 year-old mother and myself have done this same trip 3x, And each time we have been serviced by Patricia (from Mahlon Sweet Airport in Eugene). She is the best agent you have. She made sure we had everything we needed -- my mom requires wheelchair assistance, so flying is especially stressful!! She helped us through every check point and even took some pictures as we boarded the plane.  She is truly an asset to Horizon Air and Alaska Airlines.",,,,,
  Traveling musician headed to Tampa for 3 shows. Have my expensive guitar with me and was offered a place to stow it in the flight attendants closet onboard. Huge shout out to Shelly and Shari on AK flight 326 from Seattle to Tampa on 5/21 9:15am! Super kind and accommodating. I can’t thank you enough.,,,,,
"  This was the worst airline company ever. Check in staff are not properly trained. The girl that was suppose to be helping me check in doesn’t know hat to do, she keeps on asking the manager for help and her other colleague. Manager and colleague also doesn’t know what she’s doing. She keeps making phone calls then she came back to confirm that yes I as in-fact correct that a lap infant has a free check in luggage allowance. We missed our international due to their lack of knowledge, negligence, and irresponsibility. They refuse to book us with another flight so we don’t have to miss our flight, they didn’t.  I told them that we don’t have money to pay for extra since we struggled just to pay for our existing tickets. This is the only time that I felt that if you’re poor, they don’t care, people or company will just step all over you. I was willing for them to fix the problem so that we can still leave to go to Philippines. I even told them that we can sleep at the airport floor and willing to fly the next day. Both EVA air and Alaska air will not do anything about it. We ended up staying at hotel hampton inn and picked the cheapest room possible and kept making phone calls after phone calls because Alaska air said this. ",,,,,
"  I had a delayed flight into Tacoma from London with American Airlines, which mention I missed my connection to Kona with Alaska Airlines. Was told by an American Airlines representative that everything would be sorted, like our flight to Kona the next day and our over night stay in Tacoma. But when I approached someone at the American Airlines desk they wanted nothing to do with it. They said it was an Alaska Airlines problem because it was an Alaska Airlines we had missed. Which I disagree with as it was an American Airlines delayed flight that caused us to miss our connecting flight to Kona. So I then went to Alaska Airlines desk, they couldn't have been more helpful. They booked our flights to Kona the next day, booked a night at the Comfort Inn and gave us food vouchers with no cost to us. I would highly recommend Alaska Airlines to fly with as I still don't think it was there problem to look after us like they did. We had a great fight to Kona the next day, friendly cheerful cabin crew, clean air craft. I hope to fly with you in future and a big thank you to all at Alaska Airlines from Steven and Jacqueline from Scotland.",,,,,
  The management is not at all good. Seat assignment is always messed up. They made me wait till the last minute for the seat assignment. Also they kept switching gates which was very confusing,,,,,
"  One of the reasons I fly first class is the first class lounge. I pay (on average) triple the price. I went to the lounge today and was turned back with the excuse that they changed the rules to accommodate their members, that is, unless I pay an additional $30. Apparently, the $30 allows them to bend the new rules. It's not about the members, it's about the money. Just another way they are taking care of their customers. I fly about 8-10 trips per year, all of them with Alaska Airlines. Im pretty stubborn, so I mean it when I say that this is my last flight with them.",,,,,
"  First time flyer on Alaska Airlines, completely disappointed. Very unorganized, unpleasant, rude. Sad to say my flight on United was 100% better. They seemed to be confused an struggling get us boarded, flight attendants were rude and not helpful or pleasant.",,,,,
"  Smooth flight round trip and witnessed a lot of patience and great customer assistance by the staff. One of the 6 American Airlines I will fly with and I have flown on small and 4 seater planes and have followed airline travel for decades since I am a huge travel buff. Safety is number one, then customer service, then cost, then on time departures.",,,,,
"  Aircraft was in poor condition. I paid for a premium seat upgrade, and the seat was super narrow and not worth the extra cost. There was no under seat storage for two of the three seats in my row. The overhead bins are miniscule and they ran out of space before half the plane was boarded. The flight attendants were fairly inattentive to their movements and rammed into me multiple times, despite being fully out of the aisle. When beverage service started i spent a solid 5 minutes with the second seat flight attendant's bum repeatedly being shoved in my face. I understand they have a job to do, but the lack of respect for passengers space is abysmal. The airlines need to consider this when designating aisle space. The curtain separating first class is not tied/otherwise secured, and i spent 90% of the flight with it flapping in my face (seat C6). This airline is one of the worst I've had the misfortune to fly with. Every trip has been subpar, but to charge for premium seating and  cram people in like sardines in this row is outrageous. Delta or southwest are far preferable because even when they're awful, they're better than Alaska on a good day. Flights are also super limited with awful flight times for non stops, and ridiculous layovers for multi-stop trips. On board wifi is trash and not worth the $8 they Want out of you. Nothing would load.",,,,,
"  The checking agents, and the TSA screening agent suggested that the flight might be delayed. When I got to the gate, I asked them and I was immediately met by hostility from two women who were manning the counter. They stated that would be no delay, but here we are now, about one hour delayed. Everyone knew in advance, but they failed to disclose it, and I called him out on it and they got extremely hostile towards me. I will never fly these people again.",,,,,
"  I’m waiting on back surgery. Standing and walking is terribly painful. Went up twice to say I have to please have a wheelchair. Not only no chair but I had to stand in line leaning on my cane for 15 minutes just to have extra time. When I got up to the front and noted I never got the wheelchair, the gate agent dumbly said, “there’s one over there.” I pointed out it was unstaffed and I couldn’t push it myself. Got onboard, asked for help putting my little case above me. No, they’re not “allowed” to handle baggage. Man, do I miss Virgin. Worst decision to let Alaska take them over. Worst service in the industry.",,,,,
"  They lost my car seat they don’t want to be responsible to pay for it to get replaced. I had to buy a new car seat for my v vacation during my stay in San Antonio. They gave me a 75 dollar discount for next flight my car seat was 350. They told me to make a police report which I did and they still going around the bush not acting responsible for it. I’m very disappointed on Alaska Airlines, I used to absolutely love them. I was able to flight directly from Seattle to San Antonio but you can’t keep flying with someone who thinks it’s okay to leave your child without a car seat.",,,,,
"  I am very disappointed in the way I’ve been treated by flight attendants on flight 305 on April 4th 2023. I am not the smallest girl nor am I the largest but I will say I do fit in my seat well but the other two passengers next to me are a little bigger so it doesn’t allow me to sit in my seat all the way and I am pushed to the edge of my seat closest to the isle (my arm is kind of over the armrest where if someone is larger sized walking by they will bump into me). However the flight attendants on this flight seem to be fit and are not overweight at all, which is mind boggling to me because neither one of them walking by that pushed bumped or ran into my arm with the cart are overweight or obese so in my mind there’s no reason why they should be bumping me in the aggressive way they have been this whole flight so far. Neither of them apologized or even acknowledged me when they did bump into me I find it very unprofessional and unpleasant and I don’t plan on flying with Alaska again after this experience. Even someone on the plane twice the size of Gail turned to where she wasn’t bumping into me. And if that doesn’t prove that these terrible flight attendants have no respect or self awareness then I don’t know what does. All of these flight attendants need some more training on being professional and being considerate of others.",,,,,
" They took 30 minutes to an hour to de ice our plane’s wings before take-off from Boise. Once we arrived in Seattle, our plane sat there for 20 minutes. We arrived to our next gate 5 minutes late and the doors were closed off. We missed our flight, got no refund for those tickets, and had plans ruined.",,,,,
"  Absolutely horrid experience, terrible customer service. Lost Luggage for more than 3 Months. Don't ever waste your money with Alaska Airlines. Alaska Airlines lost our 3 bags on December 22, 2022. It's been 3 Months, and nothing has been done. We filed a claim in person and online, followed up in person, and have spent many hours on the phone every single week for the last 3 months only to be mistreated and to hear that Alaska Airlines don't take responsibility for their acts. My Family and I were left without clothes, lost many valuable Personal items and expensive gifts bought for Family members. We trusted our luggage to Alaska Airlines, paid for Trip Insurance, have the Baggage Claim tickets, and still are getting no help and being treated as we don't matter. ",,,,,
" As a first-time flyer, this definitely was a nice introduction to fast travel by airplane. Pros, then cons. Pros 1) Flight boarding time is usually delayed cause airport security or passenger offloading, so if you've arrived with barely an hour to get to the terminal after going through TSA and boarding pass first, you should reasonably make it. 2) Flight attendants are pretty good about making you comfortable 3) Tolerable wait times for taxiing and whatnot. Cons 1) The twin-engine plane (Boeing 737, I believe) economy seating is just enough to be problematic for anyone who has claustrophobia. Additionally, the fold-out for laptops is only big enough for the PC; you want to use a mouse, well, need to use another fold-out on your right. 2) If want additional elbow room, first-class ticket is necessary 3) Lavatories are small enough that anyone significantly fat will feel cramped. I'm skinny, and anyone who's taken care of his/her body should be able to use them without difficulty.",,,,,
"  My wife an I were coming home from a fantastic vacation, during which I severely injured my left leg. We were treated very well on Alaska Air, but Bethany took exceptionally great care of us. I was unable to remain seated due to my injury and she and the other flight attendants made sure that I was as comfortable as possible for the entire flight.",,,,,
"  Been on hold for 6 hours, booking 7 1200$ tickets and the website continues to have issue after issue. It’s like you have the audacity to want to travel these days. Alaska airlines used to be amazing, and generally once on board the flight attendants are good and all is well but the entire process from buying tickets to check in is ungodly now a days. God forbid luggage gets lost they also act like it’s your fault. If I didn’t live here I wouldn’t be flying with them, but the free bags as residents keeps me going.",,,,,
"  Never flying this airline again. Late both going to Columbus and the connecting flight returning to Oakland. Going to Columbus we were delayed and sent to another gate, only to return to the same gate we came from an hour later. On the return trip, I had to run with carry on and laptop from gate N to gate D with minutes to spare to make my flight. Also all the passengers on the return flight from CMH to Columbus had to have an additional security check at the gate - a full body pat down - before boarding the flight. What a horrible experience! One I will never repeat.",,,,,
"  Terrible attitude from the lady at 11am at gate D6. Plane was uncomfortable and the flight attendants did the bare minimum and could use some classes in being better to people. No entertainment, no snacks. Tiny bathrooms. Not a great airline at all.",,,,,

"  Flight was delayed, they tried to move our seats even though we paid to sit together. Told the woman at the D6 gate at 11AM and she tells me to calm down and saying “whatever” under her breath. Nastiest woman in the airport. The flight attendants on board are the same way. They treat their customers like garbage and delay flights. Never again will I fly with this company. Worst experience and unprofessional staff . Terrible and so disappointed. There was no reason to treat people who pay money to fly with you like that.",,,,,
"  Arrived at PDX 2 hours prior to departure, booking in took over 1 hour. The person who booked us in was nice and apologised for the delay, I had an extra case I wished to pay for the confusion and stupidity of the process was ridiculous. When trying to pay the excessive cost my credit card was not accepted so my daughter who was with me and lives in Portland tried to pay with hers neither of hers where excepted. The person try to fix issue spoke to her supervise who was rude and useless. She had the audacity to query whether we had enough money to which my daughter was very insulted. My daughter was then told to go to a machine enter money get a card to pay this also did not work. Then the assistance asked us to wait while she went to more senior person who organised payment with daughters card. Then finally finishing the paper work I was asked was I an Australian citizen even though born here and have and Australian passport. Then I had to quickly say goodbye to my daughter and go to gate. This was my 10th trip to Portland and every time issues when booking in with Alaska another time book assistance took my passport went to back with it which I did not like and was told by customs Australia never to let passport leave my sight. It is the last time I will fly with Alaska Airlines due to this experience. I was told I would receive some compensation for the stuff up or my daughter would as she gave her email address when asked. I will be sending this email to qantas to as part of star alliance with Alaska.",,,,,
"  On a direct flight cannot get the bags for the customers on the flight given 2 hours to get it through TSA security. Then, upon getting the bag delivered 12 hours later, takes 6 days and counting, to get a bag delivered to the customer who lives 2 hours away from the destination. ",,,,,
"  Worst experience ever, terrible attitude when checking in at JFK even when I am flying first class. The staff made herself a piece of work. Will never fly Alaska Airlines again.",,,,,
" Let me start this rant by saying I fly a lot, usually with Delta, but occasionally with AA if they have a quicker route, then transfer to Alaska airline for the last leg of my trip into Nome (Delta doesn’t fly there). I’ve NEVER had any complaints about a flight crew - ever. Instead, I’m the person watching out for the flight crew - completely in awe of the long shifts they work and the kindness they show to each of us. Always grateful for all they do. Like everyone else, often bewildered by the general rudeness of some of the public towards the staff. That was NOT my experience today 1/5/23. Alaska airline flight had a quicker route that sent me through Portland to Anchorage, so I chose it. Because of the amount of miles I fly, I typically get upgraded to first class (even if I don’t purchase). Today, there was no first class seats for purchase, so I ended up sitting in business class, exactly one row behind first class. I was completely fine with that. Again, no complaints. The reason for the rant. I had a horrible experience today. My Alaska airline flight 197 was delayed approx. 1 - 1.5 hours. The flight was originally a late night flight anyway, so this just made things a bit worse, but completely understandable. Things happen. The flight crew can’t control when the plane arrival/departure. However, 3 hours into my delayed flight, while everyone was sound asleep, absolutely no movement at all throughout the plane, complete graveyard silence, I got up to use the restroom and walked to the closest one (literally 5 rows in front of me) in first class. A beautiful blonde flight attendant walked up to me and told me to turn around and go to the restroom in the back. Again, no one was up in the aisles or in line for either restroom. Everyone was asleep. It absolutely floored me - really embarrassed me as the gentleman sitting next to me overheard it and rolled his eyes as I had to turn around. I see people from business class use first class restrooms all the time. I’ve never been offended. I’ve never seen anyone rerouted to the back. Anyway, I went to the back restroom and asked the two flight attendants working the back if there was a policy or some rule that I was unaware of. Minutes later - the two attendants in the back - rushed to the front to ”tell on me”. Then for a absolutely NO reason, they proceeded to make an announcement over the intercom to everyone - instructing non first class people to use the back restroom - mind you - NO one except me was had been or was up moving around. My concern, do they commonly bully people that are not in first class? Do they make a point to try and embarrass customers? The announcement was petty and team bullying. For the first time, I understand why people speak up and confront flight attendants for treating them poorly. I get it. They have you in a position of submission while your traveling. It’s so uncomfortable and sad. I suppose the lesson for me - always fly Delta, but more importantly, be mindful of how people who don’t have the means to fly first class are being treated as they may not be the “rude” passengers I once thought that they were to flight staff.",,,,,
"  A woman named Shawna at Alaska Airlines LAX helped me out and let me tell you, I travel every other week so ALOT and I’ve never met a more kind and helpful employee at an airport before. She had the most positive attitude I’ve ever seen and that’s why I wanted to write this review. I offered her a tip and she denied. Protect this woman at all costs.",,,,,
"  I have flown with this airline multiple times and have never had the issues that I had this week. It was pathetic. Right off the bat they lost my girlfriends luggage. They made good and had it delivered the following day. That's when the cancellation kicked in. So they cancelled my flight out and informed me they were working on a new reservation. That was 3 days ago. I had to work today after Christmas. I have not heard a word from anyone. It was an 8 hour hold time on the phone and there were over 1,000 people waiting in line at SeaTac Airport just for cancellations. I ended up having to book a flight out of Idaho with another airline. What baffles me is there were other airlines flying out of the same airport at the same time. This was not weather issues this was scheduling and staffing. They dropped the ball badly and cost a lot of people a lot of money.",,,,,
" The absolute worst airline I've ever flown with first our flight leaving Cleveland left an hour late for the pilot not showing up, then as we were about to land and go to our connecting flight they cancelled. We then waited 6 hours on Seattle airport to reschedule. My 4 year had to sleep on the cold floor no water or food and drink places open at that hour. A news crews even talked to us after seeing him shivering sleeping on the floor. The airline then rescheduled us for the following night and that flight is now delayed 3 hours and climbing from having no crew. Very unreliable worst airline I've ever experienced. I will never fly or recommend this airline to anyone ever again almost 3,000 people stranded in Seattle solely for this airline due to their own fault on Christmas day!",,,,,
" On the original flight from Columbus to Seattle, the women at the front desk dropped my snowboard bag and said “whoops, I hope I didn’t break anything” That was the start of our trip. We get to Seattle to find out the snowboard bag didn’t even make it on the flight. We lost hundreds of dollars not having our equipment for this trip. Our return flight on Christmas Day was canceled due to “mechanical issues” and we were told they couldn’t get us out until the 28th. My husband had to let them know he’s military and has to be back on the 27th in order for them help us. So we rebooked for today (the 26th) with three layovers. We are missing all of our connecting flights because the flight attendant was over an hour late for our first flight out of Seattle. We then had to de-plane because of an electrical issue. We’re currently being told at the podium that there’s nothing they can do for us. This is worse than the time I got trapped in France because a different airline went bankrupt right before my flight. Alaska is worse than Delta, Spirit, United, etc.",,,,,
" Terrible customer experience. Flight canceled 4 times in a week. There is little to no support to help figure out how or what to do. 8 hour hold times, inaccurate flight availability information on line, inability to self serve flight changes on line, no response from the text or chat option. They need to have a worst case scenario readiness plan in place asap. My experience was awful and to know so many people were in the same situation as me is just shameful.",,,,,
  Flight cancelled due to ice storm in Portland. Chatted with multiple agents to help me get things figured out and was issued a refund. Wanted to shout out Jackie from Phoenix for being a literal angel and being so helpful.,,,,,
"  First time ever trying to use them. They canceled my flight, and their online system would not allow me to book a flight for the next day. However, upon researching a NEW ticket I could fly with them for twice the price. This is clearly not a company that cares about its customers or puts the customer first in its flying/booking practices. As a result of their unwillingness to rebook my flight, I was not able to see my family for Christmas.",,,,,
"  It was very unpleasant journey since flight supposed to start at 10.25 which delayed to start 2.09 pm, landed at 5.32 pm instead of 2pm. However airlines did not let out passengers after 6.48pm, still in the flight. It was very stressful journey and our vacation totally collapsed. I would not recommend anyone to Alaska airlines for Hawaii vacation.",,,,,
"  I fly this route often on 3 different carriers. On my Alaska flight, I experienced service challenges in business class. No meals available for those who didn't pre-book a meal. Flight was 5 hours and the full evening, so I had no dinner. Instead, charged me for my ""snackbox"" purchase from the two economy options. When confronted on why I wasn't given a meal / why they didn't have enough, they pointed to another customer and explained that they gave it away to him. Followed up with customer service who did not offer a solution (which is a bit odd when a frequent business class traveler has taken the time to write a complaint).",,,,,
" Alaska airlines, we will never fly with you again. All excited to take our daughter who loves flights on her first flight, and the entire experience was absolutely horrible in every way. We let the woman at the gate know it was her first flight and asked if they still got wings and an opportunity to see the cockpit, and the response, ""well it's case by case but I'll tell the flight crew"". Board the flight, no one knew it was her first flight, so whatever we make our way to our seats. Daughter (who just turned two) is now crying because she couldn't see, ok no problem we didn't promise anything to her. We had purchased her a seat so she could have some space, but she only wanted to be held when the plane took off. Still crying and stewardess who was either having a bad day, or clearly has no kids, tells us she ""must be strapped into her own seat"". I explained she was crying and would be better for everyone if we could just comfort her, she gives a nasty look and says ""nope, strap her in"". Wonderful, cue hysterical baby, sorry everyone around us. At this point my child is crying hysterically, borderline throwing up, so we pick her up to comfort her (we were at a stand still on the ground, not even moving or ready for take-off), and here comes stewardess number 2. She clearly sees what's going on and we explain we just need a couple moments to settle her, she looks over at stewardess number 1 who shakes her head, and tells us we have no choice but to strap her in. So I apologize to everyone around us, and my wife and I try to console our hyperventilating daughter who continues to cry inconsolably, till we reach altitude and we are able to rip her out of the seat and settle her. First wave of drinks come out and we are completely disgusted with these woman, and stewardess number one walks over and tosses a set of wings at my wife full of attitude and says ""somebody's first flight eh"". Laughs like she had enjoyed this whole thing. Total train wreck, daughter throws up all over both of us because she was so upset, and no one cared. Another family in the row across from us with a baby was completely disgusted, these two women were acting the way they were. Oh and just to round out the 5+ hour flight from hell, the extremely over-priced wifi I paid for to play a movie and settle our daughter, would not work. It took barely 1 hour of restarts, paid time outs, credit card time outs, and buffering to get it to barely play movie. The movie timed out twice for now reason and when it finally came back the third time the speaking didn't match the peoples mouths. Tried to open a couple games and those wouldn't work because of the wifi either. Several people around us had the same struggles and some asked for refunds and were just left staring at the seat in front of them. Of the hundreds of thousands of miles I have flown, I have never been so disappointed and let down. Pilots who cant be bothered to greet kids. Flight attendants acting angry and vindictive, while also apparently enjoying acting that way. No monitors on a 5+ hour flight and garbage over-priced wifi instead. I get that expenses are up, but don't lower your standards or service too. Alaska used to be a top two airline for me, but never again. Alaska 1048 from San Diego to Boston.",,,,,
"  I was on a particularly turbulent red eye flight from Seattle to Fort Lauderdale last tuesday night and I have extreme flight anxiety. I had a panic attack in the bathroom and Victoria one of the first class flight attendants came and held my hand and talked me through the experience, then she sat me in the back row near the flight attendants. The row I was put on was with another flight attendants (I wish I knew her name) boyfriend and he talked to me for three hours while she and other attendants came by to periodically check up on me. They gave me a fuzzy heat pad and water and so much compassion. I can’t even begin to express the amount of gratitude I felt towards these people. I normally fly with my husband or family but circumstances had me take the flight on my own and I really wanted to meet my new born niece. I highly recommend this airline.. I’ve been on plenty of flights with attendants that get by doing the bare minimum.. this was not one of them. I would like to thank them from the bottom of my soul for helping me get through that night and for helping me maintain my faith in humanity.",,,,,
"  Everything about this trip went like clockwork. The fare was only slightly more than coach with a checked bag. We arrived in SFO to be immediately checked in by a counter agent. We had a pet traveling in the cabin with us and there were no issues. It took only a couple of minutes. When we got to PreCheck security line there were only a couple of people ahead of us. After going through security we headed to the Alaska Air Lounge. The lounge was not that crowded, large, and spotless. There were plenty choices of food on offer, including an automatic pancake machine. At the gate, we were promptly boarded and greeted by the agent by our first names. The plane was a typical EM175 and the seats were very comfortable. Left on time and service was great, including the protein plate. We were able to see the larger peaks, such as Shasta, Hood, and Reiner. Landing at Everett was interested with all the Boeing wide bodies waiting to be painted. Deplaning was quick and picked up our bags in a couple of minutes. Could not have asked for better service!",,,,,
"  We had a layover in Seattle on November 29th. Once we got there our second flight was canceled after waiting 2 hours for the delayed flight. The customer service line was extremely long. After about an hour in line I finally reached a customer service agent to help me get my flight changed. By that time there were no available seats on any flights that day, but I had been trying to change my flight while in line and I got a confirmation for a 9pm flight. When I stated that to the rep, she said they had double booked the seat that I was assigned to, but that she will get my on the flight since the other person had not checked in yet. She printed my ticket and handed it to me. After that I asked if there would be any compensation as we were supposed to be home by 12pm and now we had to wait until 9pm for potentially another delayed or canceled flight and this has already been hard on my family. The rep provided no help whatsoever and explained not-so-nicely that because this was not Alaska’s fault, they are not responsible for providing compensation. This made me wonder, what would be considered “their fault”, or is this some fine print that they can get out of any compensation. By this time it had stopped snowing for a couple hours and everything was melted. I couldn’t understand why all other flight carriers were taking off and landing just fine, yet Alaska had to cancel our flight completely. I understood the delay in the de-icing. I asked why it is our fault that Alaska doesn’t have this figured out. Even on the Alaska’s website it stated that they had flights prepared for the upcoming weather and that they had it all figured out. The rep started to get frustrated with me and started getting snarky. She stated that “if we give you compensation, we had to give everyone in this line compensation”. To which I replied “you should”. She continued to ramble about this weather is causing delays and I told her to look outside and I said “what weather?” Again in hadn’t been snowing and I was irritated that this was the excuse when everything was melted and it wasn’t snowing. She yelled at me and stated “Give me back your tickets”. So she was threatening to take my tickets away for the only available flight out for the rest of the day?! I was appalled! I stated “no” you cannot take my tickets. She started getting irate and stated she has been working here for 15 years and that she is working overtime and she shouldn’t even be here, that she should be home. I couldn’t believe she was escalating things as a customer service rep of 15 years, when she should be helping me out. I stated I should be home by now too! I really felt like I was calm throughout the whole conversation and yet she continued to escalate the conversation. At the end of the interaction I stated that “You will be losing a customer, not that you care”. And she said extremely snarky “No, I don’t think we will”. I said “Excuse me, you don’t think you will what?” She reiterated, “I don’t think we will be losing a customer”. What type of rude customer service representative did I just encounter? Is it my problem that she is overworked? I felt attacked and vulnerable as she tried to take away my only way of getting my family home. I asked for her name and she would not provide me her last name. As I was leaving she yelled that she would be “notating my account”, again threatening me as much as she could.",,,,,
" Alaska Airlines used to be my go to airline, I have been a loyal customer since 2009. I would fly other airlines only when I had to. Anymore AK air could be compared with Spirit Airline, but more expensive. I never used to worry about delays, cancellations, lost baggage, or rude staff. However, now I can honestly say expect all of those things with every trip. AK air used to genuinely care about its customers, but that is no longer the case.",,,,,
"  I had a credit in my Alaska Wallet from a flight I had to cancel due to covid. The credit included a payment I made for Premium Economy seats. When I went to apply the credit to a later flight I was shocked to see my cc was charged for the upgrade to Premium. Nowhere on Alaska's website does it say that credits can't be used for seat upgrades. Inquiring with customer service I was told that seat upgrades are ""service charges"" and are therefore excluded. On our recent flight from Austin-Bergstrom to Seattle I upgraded to Premium Economy, paying with a cc, not a credit, but was informed the day before that the livery had changed from a 737-900 to a 737-700 and there were no Premium seats. We are not short people and had to spend the 4 1/2 flight in very cramped seats on a flight that was booked to capacity. Delta will be our go-to airline from now on.",,,,,
"  I had the best customer service experience! I dealt with Christine in the Seattle branch and she was expremely helpful, very professional, cheerful and informative. Thank you Christine for having such wonderful customer service skills and cheerful disposition! Totally made my day and makes me feel comfortable having my children fly without me for the first time. You are a wonderful representative for the airline they're lucky to have you!",,,,,
"  Used to be a great airline but they left my husband and an entire plane of people stranded in Juneau, for 2 days, over Thanksgiving. Didn't give him a hotel voucher, won't upgrade seats now that we're traveling back home, nothing. They're ""not responsible"", and their desk agents suck in terms of customer service. I've had better flights and customer service on Spirit.",,,,,
" I purchased a ""refundable"" ticket for my mother, when she could not make the trip due to health issues I requested a refund. The airline would only refund to the original payment method, even though I no longer have access to that card or bank with that institution. The airline told me it was too bad, and I would just have to work it out with the bank. I used to love this airline but they are nothing but thieves who stole $1000 dollars from me.",,,,,
"  One day turnaround trip from Seattle to San Jose California to visit my father turning 96 years old. Flight from Seattle to San Jose is cancelled several hours before the flight. I am ""conveniently re-routed"" for the next day going through Los Angeles that would result in my arriving at 8pm. Forced to go through SF and rebook on my own. Return flight: my noon departure is delayed due to mechanical. First delay showed that flight would leave at 1:45. That changed to 2:45 and then 6pm and then 8:20. Alaska did not cancel the flight even though they knew it would be 8 hours until the part arrived and was installed. I rebooked on my own because Alaska would not cancel the flight. The noon flight ended up leaving at 8:15. In 40 years of flying, this is the worst experience I've ever had with an airline. They do not know what they are doing. Service personnel were confused, rude, and ill informed. Most of us got our information by walking with a pilot who conveyed the part delay. I'm not sure what has caused the disintegration of a functional airline, but I will never fly Alaska again. I'm frankly too scared from this experience to trust getting in the air with them.",,,,,
"  We have been Alaska Travel Card members since they began. Our last two trips, all in 2022, have had our flights changed multiple times including loss of our premium seats and reassigned to horrible seats. Both trips we used our companion ticket. The trip to Costa Rica was booked LAX to SJO non-stop but both on the trip down and back have added a stop in Liberia which Alaska used as an excuse to bump us from our premium seats. Our trip back to the States, we checked in showing stop in Liberia and confirmed premium seats and purchased food only to wake up and find they had changed it again showing no stop to Liberia and loss of premium seats from LAX to PDX (giving us a seat with no windows). No food. We are now boarded and informed we are stopping in Liberia even though our boarding pass shows direct to LAX. I don’t know what is going on but they are no longer reliable in terms of booking a flight or picking a seat. Count yourself lucky if you get on a flight. I may be looking into Capital One travel card that allows you to book with any airline and the airline treats you as a full paying customer - not treated poorly for being a loyal customer.",,,,,
"  Do not count on Alaska Airlines to help if you request mobility assistance. In Boston - I requested assistance, they refused to help me to the counter. My luggage was falling, I was tripping. But I got no help! Then I was told I had to put my checked luggage on the platform. I said I needed help I was told ""you have to put your luggage up here"". So a disabled woman tripping and falling over a cane managed to put up a 50 pound piece of luggage. Only after did the incompetent woman ask if I needed assistance? I had asked for help three times and was told no! So I said - if I'm required and able to lift a 50 pound suitcase by myself, I will get myself down to the gate since Alaska Airlines is useless. On my way from Anchorage to Boston I took Delta - I had to pay/tip every person who touched the wheelchair - and I still had to pick up my own baggage? I got to the gate myself bumbling through TSA, who wondered why I didn't have help. When I said I was with Alaska Airlines, they won't help - the woman said ""Ah - yes Alaska Airlines, no, they are not much help"" and she proceeded to help me. I arrived at the gate and was immediately pursued by an irate employee asking me loudly my name - and very loudly stating they have to fill out a form for when a customer requests assistance but refuses the wheelchair. I quietly explained the situation, and he continued to chastise me, mimic my words - told him to rip it up. No problems here. He refused. He got louder and more obnoxious. He demanded an explanation - I said, if you're going to make me lift a 50 pound bag by myself, after I kept asking for help - I figure I'll be better off getting myself to the gate. I regret not filing a report on this guy, but I have sympathy because its very difficult to get competent help in Massachusetts or Logan airport. I arrived in Seattle, jumped in their wheelchair and barely made it to the connection. Arrived in Anchorage - there was a rep on the ramp talking on the radio stating he had already requested wheelchairs that were not there. So I didn't bother to hang around. I walked all over the airport and I am in serious pain, I will never depend on Alaska Airlines to help anyone disabled. It works against us and we have to tip everyone so it costs more. Stewards and stewardesses range from incompetent to excellent.",,,,,
"  Alaska Airlines reduced the value of their mileage program after I had responded to incentives and earned 108,000 miles. I tried to book a rewards flight and Alaska had reduced the value of my accumulated miles so much that I could only get tickets on the worst flights that landed the day after take-off. Just another corporate bait and switch ripoff. ",,,,,
"  Have taken this same flight weekly usually with friendly service. However today was awful. Had pre checked luggage and they would not help me. Wanted me to stand in a 45 minute line to hand them luggage. Claimed the agent that would take pre checked bags didn’t come in till 5 am when this has never been the case. When I asked if an agent could take it instead of saying no the person was extremely rude! Ended up using carrying on luggage but had already paid the $30. Rider be warned. If you are flying on a Tuesday (I usually fly on a Monday) the people working not on Monday are rude, abrasive, and awful. Will be cautious about flying them in the future.",,,,,
"  The landing from Seattle to Ontario arrived at 8:35 pm resulted in damage to my luggage. The pilots landed so hard that some of the overhead luggage bins popped open falling onto some passengers! When picking up my baggage, the area around both of the suitcase's wheels was broken. I reported the damage to customer service and took photos of the luggage. Customer service gave me an email address for my photos. I was told they would take a couple of months to assess the damage and to wait for them to contact me by email. I have not heard from them. I paid $350 for my London Fog suitcase. I will not fly Alaska Airlines again. ",,,,,
"  Awful experience! They made at least 15 people with carry-on bags check them. And they lied they won’t fit when indeed those luggages are compliant. Very barebones service, not a good value for the money. It felt like very poor service and overall unpleasant experience.",,,,,
"  They put me on 2 different types of jets, I can’t recall the type or pull it up because I purchased my tickets through Priceline. I wound up with Alaska Airlines because the tickets were free, can’t beat free! The experience wasn’t terrible. The first jet was small and I had to walk on the landing pad in order to board and get off. For that particular jet everyone that had carryon with wheels they had to put it in cargo. They did have have beverages and pretzels. The seats for that particular jet were smaller than your average plane seat. It was a little over an hour flight and it wasn’t super uncomfortable, mind you I’m ~190lbs woman. The second jet was much more comfortable, they had beverages=. Looking at their prices, they’re not terrible for what you get, you get what you pay for. If Priceline ever offered Alaska Airlines for free again I wouldn’t hesitate at all.",,,,,
  We recently took Alaska Airlines from Newark to San Francisco. I am a 74 year old woman and even though I was wearing a jacket I was cold. I asked the Flight Attendant for a blanket and was told they don’t supply blankets anymore. As we were departing the plane and walking past 1st class I saw that every seat had a blanket on it. We will never fly Alaska Airlines again. ,,,,,
  So impressed with the way Alaska airlines handled our pets enroute. We flew from Alaska to Dallas related to a relocation so our cats had to fly for their first time for such a long journey across the lower 48. They flew in carriers under the plane scary for us! Alaska airlines called our pets by their names and Places boarding pass stickers on their crates with our names and a row of sticker ticket with their names and our names. One would be removed from the carrier before each take off and handed to me letting us know that they are indeed on our plane. Each time we landed a ground crew member would greet us and tell us they saw our cats personally and they have arrived and doing well they once again called them by name and always with a smile. Every Alaska airlines staff I saw regarding our cats seemed to be so protective of them . I could not ask for a better experience in such a scary situation. Max and Ruby are doing great and loving Texas life! Thank you Alaska airlines.,,,,,
"  I flew from San Diego to Newark on 10/14/2022. I am Handicapped. Lousy customer service, all around. Flight delay which can happen from time. Main Cabin seats hardly any leg room. Once the Airplane landed, it took an hour to get the plane to park. And instead of being in Terminal A, we wound up in Terminal B.  NO Wi Fi",,,,,
"  Arrived early LAX and wanted to fly standby on earlier flight. Alaska charges $50 to do this. Its free on United. I needed to text Alaska for help because gate and terminal was not on my boarding i formation, and after waiting for 6 or 7 minutes for Nikki she didnt give me a chance to text an answer and ended the chat. Customer service is not Alaska’s forte. I recommend Delta or United.",,,,,
" Alaska changes your seat without telling you, switches you from an aisle seat to a non aisle seat (over 300lbs here) without notice and without any chance to fix it. When asked they said “yeah it happens” and shrugged. It just happened to me back to back on 2 legs of my flight to San Francisco. They don’t even apologize. During check-in, their seat map is mysteriously “not available”, so you can’t verify your seats. I have no idea why they do that. I probably wouldn’t care if they had respected my aisle seating but they couldn’t even do that. The 3 persons I talked to were patronizing, unapologetic, and tried to insinuate it was on me and then told me that there never was any guarantee about the seat you book (what? Never seen that on any other airline).",,,,,
 More than an hour late leaving Newark. After arriving at SFO we waited at the tarmac for more than 30 minutes due to another plane at our gate. Uncoordinated and poorly run airline.,,,,,
"  My wife and friends and I enjoyed a beautiful week in Washington on the coast. When it came time to return home we wanted to extend our flight by 1 day. I found what I thought was the toll free number for Alaska Air online. After speaking to a gentleman about the price increase I decided to not purchase it. When we went online to check in, 2 tickers were gone. I immediately called the number back and was informed that they had been canceled on our end. After much arguing back and forth I hung up. My wife and friend had no tickets and we were to fly out the next day. I went back to Google and found a different number to a nice lady in Boise. She informed me that we had been scammed. I asked to have it reversed and she stated, ""there is nothing I can do. We have this a lot. Scammers cancel the tickets and try to get the refund."" I asked why there isn't a verification text or email to confirm the cancelation? Especially if this is something that happens often. She then said we could purchase tickets at a 400% mark up. Having no options, we did just that. Once we got the new tickets we realized they were for our exact original seats. I have a hard time believing that a large company whose job is to service customers and knows that scams such as this doesn't have some protocol for just a situation. I highly recommend finding another flight service. Alaska Airlines I feel has no concern for their customers. Absolute garbage service or protection.",,,,,
" What a terrible experience. Truly an awful airline. Every possible delay that could happen, happened. Here is the sequence of events: 1) Flight got delayed by an hour (fine whatever this happens) 2) Initial plane has mechanical issues forcing us to have to be bused 10 minutes away to another aircraft (fine, I understand sometimes it’s just a bad day) 3) We have to stand on the bus for 30 minutes in the Cali heat because the plane we were switched to was actively being worked on when the bus we were in arrived (this is where I start getting peeved) 4) We get on the plane and are notified one of the bathrooms is out of order 5) Fine flight, a little bumpy, whatever. 6) We land in Salt Lake, I think the ordeal is over, here’s where it got so much worse. 7) They inform us they do not have a gate for us to approach to get off the plane and that we are in “limbo”. They say it will be another 20-40 minutes until we can get off the plane (I’m annoyed at this point but recognize it’s almost over I’ll be home soon) 8) This process repeats multiple times. We are told every 20-40 minutes that it will be another “20-40 minutes” and this goes on for approximately 2 hours. During this time, as a consultation they offer us an 8oz middle school milk carton of water? 9) Finally we get a gate, we pull up, everyone starts standing up getting their bags out of overhead and we all start to notice it’s taking a while to open the door (about 15 minutes at this point) and then the announcement comes on that there is “an issue of a large gap between the plane and the hallway thing that connects to the plane” and at this point the plane is turned off, meaning the AC is turned off and we’re forced to sit there for another 25 minutes before finally getting off the plane. I would absolutely never ever fly with this airline again. I would choose any option besides this. Spirit, Frontier, man I’d rather drives just an absolute “flightmare”.",,,,,
"  I bought round trip tickets with Alaska Airlines. On the way to Honolulu everything was fine, but on the way back the flight attendants were excessively rude. I noticed that the airline itself allows their flight attendants to behave with the passengers as they wish and do whatever they want with the passengers - be rude and then they were given the right to throw passengers off the flight for no legitimate reason. I’ve read after that Alaska Airlines is short on flight attendant and even pilots and that is why they turn a blind eye to their behavior. Do not demand anything or you will kick out from the flight just because you dare to ask something.",,,,,

"  They are canceling flights more than most other airlines right now. They rescheduled mine, from a non stop to a 1 stop, with a lay over so short we wouldn't have been able to make the connection even if they were run perfectly on time (which they never are). So we ended up canceling that flight all together. Gave them another shot, and they outright canceled my flight less than 12 hours before take off, at 9pm. Thankfully I was still up, otherwise I would've been screwed in the morning. Now I have to pay double for a last second flight. I'm done with them. Save yourself the hassle and never book with them.",,,,,
" I travel for work almost every week. I do make sure I check in at least 20 hrs before my boarding time. In my 6 years of traveling every week, I have never had my seat number changed last minute without my permission. I had seat 12A (a window seat) changed to 32b (the last seat in the center by the toilet). So apparently they gave my seat to some family who wanted to be side by side even thought it was allotted to me. When spoke to the person at the desk, he was extremely rude and told me straight of that my seat was give to them because they wanted to sit together. I am never going to fly Alaska again. Do not recommend it.",,,,,

"  Excellent and professional. We had our children flown to Illinois to visit their sister. They were unaccompanied minor’s. Even though they are 13 and 14 and did not need assistance, we felt better having someone keep an eye on them. From customer service to the ticket agent to the flight attendants, I could not be more pleased. They boarded the plane first with the flight crew and departed the plane last with the flight crew. We were allowed to escort them to their gate and sit with them until they boarded the plane and were in the air. They checked their aunts ID upon arrival and ours when they returned. I felt they were safe and as a parent, I needed to know they were safe. The kids had a blast and the flight attendants said they were well behaved and polite. We even googled their flight number and knew exactly where they were at all times. One if the kids was texting us from 35,000 feet. They had a snack on board and watched movies during their flight. Awesome job Alaskan. We will use this airline again. Thank you for making this parent feel their children were in the best of hands and thank you for looking out for my kids.",,,,,
"  I had a frustrating experience with Alaska. I got a round trip from San Jose to San Diego with my family and among the free items you can check-in are strollers and car seats. On the first flight we were able to check-in for free our son's car seat and wagon-stroller for free. We even called ahead days in advance to ensure we could take our wagon-stroller with us for free. However on the return flight we had to pay to document and check-in the wagon-stroller. The handling of situation was terrible from Alaska. They argued that wagons are not strollers but failed to show any Alaska documentation of their definition of a strollers as ours has seat belts for the kids and can fold to fit the size of large stroller but has a wagon shape. The personnel argued that double strollers were fine but ours was not (even though our could be smaller). We showed them the model on the internet (which states it is a stroller wagon) and even when you search on google for strollers images of this type show on top along the traditional strollers. They argued that allowing us to check-in our ""wagon"" for free during our first flight was a mistake. To make matters even worse, the personnel argued that we use the stroller to carry our stuff which is besides the point as you can do that why any stroller. This suggested to me that Alaska didn't care whether this was a stroller or not and made it harder to actually get an understanding of the rules rooted on Alaska's policies, which Alaska was not able to provide. Along this lines (about not really being helpful) and taking their attitude to a different level, one of the personnel we were having the conversation in order to try to ""solve"" the problem threatened us by saying ""do you want to fly today?"". Not sure what this person was thinking but that only make this experience worse. In the end a more cool headed personnel came in, acknowledged our frustrations and provided a number we can use to complain. This frustrating and unpleasant experience was a result of the poorly documented, inconsistent policies and communication channels at Alaska, and exacerbated by the even worse customer service from Alaska employees at the San Diego airport. I will avoid using Alaska in the future as it is not worth the stress.",,,,,
"  Horrible experience. Showed up to the airport and was told I could not check-in because they have a cutoff time. They charged me $25 to move me to another flight. After getting through security, I arrived at my gate before the original flight. Despite the flight not being full, they told me they could not allow me to board because as soon as they check for empty seats, they have to close the gate.

"  I recently had two very enjoyable flights with Alaska in early July. I had never used Alaska before but after a recommendation from a friend, decided to give them a go. I had just arrived on a 13 hour flight from New Zealand, arriving at LAX and needing an onward flight to SFO. I checked in via a kiosk for the SFO flight and I was lucky enough to be offered a $20 upgrade to First Class which I logically accepted. Everything went seamlessly from check in, right through to priority boarding on the plane which was an Embraer ERJ 175. I was so impressed with the way the First Class team member dealt with a very self obsessed passenger who was demanding a lot of attention in the First Class cabin. At no stage did the team member lose it with this passenger and she remained professional and cordial at all times. I was actually sorry the flight was so short as the service was so good. The flight back on 5th July was on an Airbus A320. Check in was painless but TSA was a nightmare as everyone was flying home after the 4th. We were probably just over an hour late departing. This flight was just as enjoyable, very slick and polished and I have no qualms about using Alaska while flying internally in the US. I should use United my default Star Alliance option, but with this pricing and service I am quite happy to use Alaska in future.",,,,,

He was absolutely fantastic and worked with me to get me on a later flight and back home the same day. Really appreciate the level of customer service.",,,,,
  This airline can’t get out of its own way. Cancellation s and delayed flights are routine. Unable to plan a trip that depends on any arrival time. They’re very apologetic but no improvement has been seen for months.,,,,,
 San Diego to Kansas City via Dallas. Alaska Airlines is operating a bait and switch scam. You book through Alaska and expect to fall under their polices but they share flights with American Airlines. As an active duty military member this makes a big difference for me. Alaska doesn’t charge military for overweight bags but American does. I was forced to pay extra fees to an airline that I DID NOT BOOK WITH! I purposely chose an airline so that I could have an overweight bag. Both airlines point fingers at each other but neither is willing to remedy the problem.,,,,,
"  I will never fly with Alaska again. After being delayed for four hours, my flight was canceled because of a problem with the hydrolic system. That's fine, it happens. However, when I asked to rebook, the agent told me she couldn't get me onto any flights until two days later. This was simply not true. I could show her on my phone five flights to the same destination the next day. I could hear e ery other agent book passengers to the same destination with the same party size the next morning. When I asked her why other agents were able to book passengers, the agent was very rude and rolled her eyes at me. Passengers after me in other lines were able to book flights as well, but the agent told everyone in her line she wasn't able to rebook them. This is the second time in a month Alaska has messed up my travel plans. They have joined Spirit on my ""never again"" list",,,,,
" Alaska Airlines lost 4 customers with how they handled their affairs. My partner's 10 year old son and his friend / guardian were supposed to fly out of PDX, after visiting us for two weeks, on July 13th for a 10 am flight. After they boarded, everyone on the flight got the run around as to why they were delayed and then had to get off the flight and got rebooked for the following day, July 14th for 3pm. For some reason they were told to get off the plane but their luggage somehow made it to Seattle, which was an absolute nightmare because my partners son doesn't live with us, nor his friend, so they didn't have anything as to clothes or toiletries for the next day, except whatever they were wearing. My partner's friend and son waited about 6 hours after the supposed initial take off at the airport due to the delays, with three of those hours getting the run around as to where their luggage is. My partner had to leave work to go pick them up. I get on the phone with Alaska that evening after work to try to find out where their bags are and to get compensation for the whole deal. We told Alaska to not send it back to Portland if they weren't able to get it that night, to just send it to Albuquerque, which they reassured us. They gave us a $50 voucher for each to get underwear, socks, and stuff for the night and told us to call customer care in the morning. I called customer care in the morning and the lady was just God awful, no help what so ever. I asked for a refund on the $60 luggage fee since they didn't get have their luggage and thought that was a fair compensation. We were told Alaska doesn't do refunds and put me back on the phone with baggage. Baggage reassured us that the bags would be in Albuquerque when they landed. Well they landed in Albuquerque to find out that their luggage was sent back to Portland and they will fly it back to deliver it later to their address sometime this week or next week. Seriously? First Alaska delayed their flight until the next day, gave us the run around and we lost work hours, can't give us a straight story on the luggage claim, and when we ask just for the a refund on the $60 luggage fee they so no, we don't do refunds but here's a $50 voucher for a future flight. How about no, we are never flying Alaska Airlines again. I flew Southwest last year and my flight was delayed 4 hours, they gave me a $100 voucher without even asking. Seriously Alaska? You messed up hardcore with the flight being reschedule and losing their luggage and all that was compensated was a $50 voucher with the worst customer service? Yeah, we're never flying Alaska again, I'm sticking with Southwest, they've never done me dirty. I'd give Alaska a zero rating if I could.",,,,,
"  My husband and I paid $2,500 for premium seats to fly from Seattle to Ohio. During the flight, I needed to use the restroom badly. We were seated approximately 2 to 3 rows from first class. Therefore, the first class restroom was much closer than the main cabin restrooms. I was willing to use the main cabin restroom, and I had used the main cabin restroom previously. This one time, though, there was an excessive line. I have a bladder issue, unfortunately, and waiting in line to use the restroom would have been difficult as I was in pain. So, I went to try to use the first class restroom. When I attempted to use the first class restroom, I was met with resistance by the stewardesses in that the stewardesses would not allow me to use the restroom. The flight attendant stood in front of me and stated “ the bathroom is in the back.” I explained to both how I have a bladder issue and I am in need to use the bathroom. They both stated I am not in first class and that I need to go use the bathroom in the back. I explained that there is a long time and I was unable to wait due to my pain. She shrugged her shoulders and stated I was not in first class and I cannot use that bathroom. They had no empathy and put arbitrary rules above a passenger’s physical well being. ",,,,,

"  Booked a family trip in January. 2 Adults and two Kids. Alaska airlines opted to combine two flights into 1. My family was kicked out of the premium seats we had paid for, and where dispersed throughout the plane. After spending an hour on the phone with the airline, we are all together on our return flight (not in premium) But our outbound flight still has our children separated from us, but in premium. The only help the airline offered is for us to talk with the gate agent and hope that someone is willing to swap. We where never notified of out seats being changed. If I had not been a proactive person, we would not have found out we where dispersed through the plane till we arrived.",,,,,
" This airline is indeed a disgrace in the airline industry. I had the worst travel experience of my life in Italy. Upon arrival in Rome, we waited for 2 hours at the baggage claim area, no one did ever inform us that this airline had a strike and no one knows where our luggage was. We had to spend another 2 hours lining up at the customer service to fill out a claim form and we were told that someone will call us when they find our luggage. Ergo, we left the airline empty handed. 3 days had passed, no calls and no one was available to pick up our calls, we decided to go back to the airport. Hundreds of pieces of luggage were everywhere, anyone could freely get any luggage as no one was monitoring it. We only found one of the luggage and the other one went missing. We reported our missing bag via email since as we don't have time to line up for another couple of hours to declare our missing bag as we were headed to our our next destination. Only to be told that they are not responsible for our missing luggage, that it is our responsibility to report it to the police. We were really shocked on how these people handle this situation - as if they are really used to this kind of situation. Their defense is ignore complaints or concerns like there's nothing wrong. The missing bag is not fault of our own! Their crew went on strike, their passengers are innocent with what's going on with their company. It's not fair that they dragged us with their misery and screw up our holiday just like that. As soon as I came back home after our vacation, I immediately called their customer service, their agents were just hanging up on me whenever they hear the purpose of my call. This is truly unbelievable! Until now, no one hasn't gotten back to us about the status of our missing luggage.",,,,,
" A terrible experience. A disgrace. From the wifi not working (not as advertised) to the lack of service on flight (for over 9 hours we were left without drinks, no juices nor any other drink was served except for water that you had to get up and go ask for) to the 2 hostesses at the check-in making sexist comments about my husband being 20 years older than me. They literally gossiped in my face in Italian while checking my documents unaware that I speak Italian too. Needless to say, this happens only with Alitalia!",,,,,
"  Will never fly Alitalia again - first they send me a message to check in and two hours later they email me to say the flight was cancelled. Not even 24 hours before the scheduled flight. They provided no alternative flights, only a request for reimbursement. Who knows how long that will take to finalize, in the meantime I'm at a resort scrambling to reschedule it for the same day with Alitalia - I find a flight out (not easy to do when you're on the island of Cagliari, and Alitalia is the only airline servicing Cagliari from Fiumicino airport in Rome) and pay for that one too, have to make it a round trip because the website doesn't per me choose just one-way. So I get that confirmation by email and think crisis averted, but 15 minutes later I receive another email from Alitalia cancelling that reservation too! I go online to see what is going on with the company, and apparently they're planning to strike two days after my scheduled flight. I call both customer service numbers and they don't answer, then the call gets disconnected, what utter hell they put their customers through without so much as an explanation, or a flight alternative! Never again will I use them, horrible example to set as a company.",,,,,
"  I’ve never seen such a bad company. Rude people. No service at all. They lost my luggage. Well it has been on ""delivery"" for the last 2 days…. Terrible choice",,,,,
"  Worst airline experience of my life. Alitalia workers were on strike when we landed in Rome from Olbia, Sardinia, and no one had bothered to tell passengers before we checked our bags to embark. We were told we could not have our luggage back due to the strike, and that it would be sitting on the tarmac for days. We had a flight home to Toronto the following day and did not have days to wait for our luggage. The staff was incredibly rude and unconcerned with the situation they had imposed on their customers. We have ZERO faith we will ever see our luggage again, which almost a week later is still sitting at Fiumicino airport with no response from Alitalia to my emailed inquiries about when we will have them returned to us or receive reimbursement for the lost items.  They are chaotic, rude, and will not be accountable for any costs they impose on you.",,,,,
"  Worst customer service ever! First they canceled our flight (no email to let us know ahead of time) they let us know when we were in the airport, Gladly we could change our flight, I saw a customer service not using a mask during a pandemic, they never asked us for COVID test during a pandemic, my passport last name and my married last were not the same and they made a huge deal about it and they would not let us get in the plane until I show a marriage certificate. Let alone I needed help and all the stuff and customer service looked at me like they don’t work there and pretty stressful experience.",,,,,
"  We flew from Brindisi to Rome, service was trash everyone there is on a power trip, no customer service skills at all. Very rude. Then Rome to NY, the flight was fine, but they didn't pay Delta for our connecting flight to Atlanta. Delta found our name in the system but said the spots were only reserved and basically Alitalia owed them money, to actually book the flight. We didn’t find this out till we got to NY because none of the service desks/ppl at the gate were able to print us our ticket in Rome or brindisi and didn’t say why. So we get to NY Find this out and end up missing our flight. We’re still on the phone with the airline on hold to get this sorted out. I’m very disappointed with my overall experience with this airline. Unreliable airline and rude people working for them. These are only the issues we had on the way back home to ATL. We had issues otw to Rome too- again rude staff and terrible customer service.",,,,,
"  This is the worst airline ever! Starting with a website that is sooo Not user friendly. To the extremely rude and unprofessional staff on the phone and in the airport. Nothing like waiting to check in and only 2 people working the counter while 6 people stand around talking to one another’s door there’s about 60 people on line. Lazy doesn’t even cover how these people acted! The food on the plane was awful! You could only have water to drink - the food was served prison style. No one smiled or even pretended to be happy, you felt like they were doing you a favor just being there. They picked up the trays of uneaten food and that was the last you saw of these miserable people. I did ask why they weren’t serving and soft drinks I was told it was due to COVID restrictions which I found out was false. The inflight entertainment was a joke 9 hours of flying with movies from 1990. Never again will I fly Alitalia.",,,,,
"  Very bad airline, I cancelled my trip in June 2020, they gave me a voucher to use in Europe only and never told me I had it, it only lasted for 6 months then it expired. I found out myself when I called. I couldn't use the voucher credit as travel in Australia is banned and we are in Lockdown. They wouldn't extend but can apply refund only for the tax part of the ticket. So I lost all the money for my ticket. Can only get a tiny bit back. But when I call them in Italy they are very rude they hang up when I asked them to repeat what they said.  Very rude and not helpful and greedy to keep peoples money. Absolutely horrible. Will never book with them again.",,,,,
"  Alitalia cancelled my flight, replaced my ticket with a flight with only half the itinerary, which I obviously cancelled, and now I'm still waiting on my refund 4 months later! The worst is that they have horrible customer service, I wait for hours on the phone, until someone simply hangs up on me. This happened at least five times. I will never fly them again.",,,,,
"  To me, this is the worst European air company: unreliable, disrespectful to customers and finally, a real fraud.  Last year, Alitalia canceled my flight from Bologna to Palermo (via Roma) without any replacement offers. I completed a form required by Alitalia for a refund and 11/20/20 they sent me email, that Alitalia issued a refund to my credit card account for e-ticket. However, this refund was never sent to my Bank. I checked with the Bank a couple of times and then, sent email to Alitalia customer service. In response, I immediately got auto-reply email requiring calling their USA customer service. I called Alitalia “USA customer service”, in fact located in Tirana, Albania. They told me that I need to wait for 90 days because there are too many refunds. In 4 months I sent a new email and got the same auto-reply. Btw, I've never got any other emails from them - only auto-replies, which were sent from ""no-reply"" address I called again to “USA” customer service. This time, a representative assured me that a refund will be sent in 72 hours and he’ll call me about this. As I expected, there were no refund and no call. In a couple of weeks, I sent another email, got one more auto-reply and called to Albanian (means USA!) Alitalia customer service. This time, a representative listened to my long boring story and just hung up on me. During last year, as many of us, I’ve experienced a number of flight cancellations. All American and European air companies refunded their cancelled flights, including low-cost ones (like Vueling), but only Alitalia did not fulfill its obligations. This is why Alitalia is to me the worst European air company: unreliable, disrespectful to customers and finally, a real fraud. Definitely, I’ll try my best never to use Alitalia and do not recommend this company to any travelers.",,,,,
"  I booked 3 tickets in March 2021 on Alitalia for trip in July 2021 to Cairo via Rome. In June 11th I learned that the airline decided to cancel my the flight from Washington to Rome due to COVID19 as they stated without notifying me not until a friend of mine who's flying on the same flight told me about receiving an email indicating the cancelation. Called customer service, they offer me options : either I pay $1600- $4000 per ticket to change my flight to New York-Rome-Cairo or they can refund me my money back. What's more interesting that they operate flights back from Cairo-Rome-Washington. I guess that COVID19 only works on the flights from Washington to Rome but not on the flight back or on flights from New York. Now I am struggling trying to find tickets to my destination as I am very close to my trip and all the prices went up. ",,,,,
"  I booked a trip to Europe with Alitalia through my credit card for May 2020 before COVID-19 was an issue. I bought travel insurance in case I had to cancel the trip for any reason. Once COVID-19 started escalating, I had to cancel my trip. I am an essential worker and couldn't leave the US or else I wouldn't be allowed back on some job sites. The credit card company told me the only way to get a refund is by talking directly to the airline, but I haven't been able to get anywhere with Alitalia. What is the point of buying traveler's insurance if not for instances like this? They are not allowing me to rebook the trip and are also refusing to give me a refund, so they basically ate my money. I am very dissatisfied with the customer service at Alitalia and will never recommend them to anyone who is planning a trip to Europe.  This is a helpless situation, and they are taking full advantage of it. Even one star is too much to give to them.",,,,,
"  They don't offer a glass of water. The staff didn't greet me on boarding my flight or when the flight landed, the staff just disappeared.",,,,,
"  London to Rome return. Not a good experience. Because of Covid-19 restrictions, everything is an excuse for not comply. Customer service ""does not exist"", ground and cabin staff service are very poor, and often staff is impolite. Quality of food and drinks on board is despicable. I do not recommend this airline for short/medium haul flights.",,,,,
"  On 14 July, 2020 they informed me by email that the return leg of a flight had been cancelled. The email said that if I wanted to reschedule the trip I had to call certain numbers or go on the website for other options. The website included reimbursement as an option, but the Alitalia email informing me of the cancellation had a booking number which the website did not recognise. The electronic ticket number gave no joy either as, for some reason, Alitalia generated different ticket numbers for this journey - and so I just couldn't be sure that the request had to be recognised. The website is full of glitches and is generally frustrating to use. Having wasted quite a bit of time on the website, I had no option but to get on their ""helpline"" which, I knew from various previous experiences, is a misnomer. I called several times, was put on hold for very long periods and then cut off and, when I was lucky enough to be transferred to an operator, that person cut me off without offering any assistance. A few weeks on, I still have no idea if my ticket will be reimbursed and have now wasted hours on this matter. Unfortunately, this is not a covid-related development - this is the kind of service I have experienced with Alitalia for many years. Unfortunately, I often have no option but to fly with them. The in-flight experience with Alitalia is no worse than with a budget airline, but their customer service - through both the website and the call centre - is the worst I know. With all the covid uncertainty, these services are more important than ever as passengers are more likely than before to have to re-book or cancel flights. Avoid Alitalia if you can.",,,,,
"  London to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi. I have not flown yet, my flight is next weekend and want to know why my flight has not been cancelled? My flight transits through Rome and Abu Dhabi before landing in Melbourne. Rome is in lockdown due to COVID-19 and the UAE has closed it's borders meaning you can't transit through Abu Dhabi anymore. Furthermore, the FCO has advised against all but essential travel so this is utterly baffling! I am not happy as I expect this flight to be cancelled and given a full refund.",,,,,
"  Tokyo to Rome. The airplane was dirty and poorly maintained. Me and my neighbor had broken seats and our screens were small and not functioning properly. Staff was unprofessional. Chatting loudly with each other throughout the flight, even during the service. As I move to the back of the plane to get something to drink, they were sitting there having their loud conversation and minding their own business. No one asked me if I needed something. ",,,,,
  Buenos Aires to Rome. Great shame that comfortable seats and good airplane were let down by dismal food and undrinkable coffee. Toilet facilities used by passengers strolling through from other cabin sections unchallenged. Check in at Buenos Aires disorganised and made to wait for an hour. It really would not take much management to improve it.,,,,,
"  London to Rome. We came very Early. In fact came in 4 hrs. At the airport and was the first few early passengers.

"  Rome to Prague. On September 15, 2019, we bought 2 tickets on the airline's website for January 15, 2020 from Rome to Prague. November 13, 2019 by mail we received a message that our flight was canceled We contacted the contact center, where we were asked to purchase tickets for another flight with an additional fee. The operator did not warn us that the new flight is also joint and there are no clear agreements with the partner Czech airlines and sold us a new ticket. As a result, we paid another money and received a confirmation email for flight AZ7546 on January 15, departing at 14-50 However, on December 6, I again received a letter that our flight was canceled. When I called the contact center, I communicated with an operator. She told me that the flight at 14-50 does not fly. To my objection that the flight on 15.01 at 15-15, for which we originally purchased tickets, exists on the website of Czech airlines (indicated that together with Alitalia), the operator replied that our flight on this flight is not possible. There are no other direct flights on January 15 As a result, I had to issue a refund. The operator assured me that they will issue a refund immediately, within 3 banking days I will receive money on the card. How could you sell tickets when there are no clear agreements with the partner airline? Why didn't I get a refund and buy a ticket from Czech airlines for the flight I need when I canceled my first flight? It has been more than two months since the ticket refund was issued at the contact center. Still no refund for my money. ",,,,,
"  Bologna to Sao Paulo return via Rome. Every flight on time, the planes were clean and tidy. It's the first time i experienced the premium economy and i have to say that the value for money is great, mostly for a 12 hours flight. Really nice legroom and seat inclination. IFE poor as always, they shouldn update it! Cabin crew, friendly, polite and helpful .. special mention to the cabin crew AZ675 on 05/02/20. I appreciated the welcome cocktail, but is not possible to serve it in a plastic cup. Food really good, the best food you can find on a plane! No wifi on the plane.",,,,,
"  Rome to Brindisi. In Brindisi and in Rome, sky priority boarding is not respected when passenger have to be transported by bus from the airport to the aircraft. On contrary, in the airport of Verona, once sky priority passengers are in the bus they are in a segregated area from the rest of the passengers and once the bus reach the aircraft first the bus doors of the area where sky priority passengers are segregated and so they can board first. It is advised that similar practice is implemented in other airports where Alitalia operates.",,,,,

"  Rome to JFK, New York on 1/3/20. We sat in Row 26. The seating configuration was 2-4-2. We had the four middle seats. Completely lacking on this flight was comfort, even a minimal amount was not to be found.  The flight almost had to be turned around within 15 minutes of take-off due to a loud verbal altercation between a family siting in Row 26 behind us and the passengers seated behind them in Row 27 - all because of reclining seats and absolutely no room because of reclining seats. The aisles were also so narrow that it was virtually impossible for 2 people to pass each other in the aisle. The seats were so uncomfortable that not even the arm rests fully raised to the vertical position.  I have never experienced seats before where the arms did not fully raise to a vertical position.  The food was poor on this 8 hour flight. One meal was lasagne and the second meal or snack was some sort of pizza that was rolled like a burrito, I could not ea that.  The crew was not exceptionally friendly. They were mostly missing during the flight when not serving the meals and were congregating at the back of the plane. Even though this was a daylight flight, we took off 2.35 pm Rome time, the lights in the cabin were turned off early in the flight. Te movie selection was minimal and not very good.",,,,,
"  Washington to Rome. The trip was a fail because my passport expires within the three months needed to enter Rome (mistake on me) but my issue is after you have processed my passport and then printed my boarding pass they still allowed me to pay for bags when it should have been flagged that I wouldn’t be able to fly. I’m at the gate and the attendant looks at my passport and says “you aren’t valid”. Ok so will my baggage fee be refunded, no. This is definitely unfair. Contacting the customer support team was a good lesson learned that all support staff are not created equally. These guys should have given my money back at the least but such is life. Hopefully they get better and it’s true you get what you pay for (sometimes).",,,,,
"  Rome to Los Angeles was the worst flight experience I’ve had. The first problems occurred when we tried to check in online, with Alitalia’s website it took over 3 hours just to check in and print boarding passes. I tried to to call Customer Service for help, to no avail. Onboard the seats are narrow, and there’s no leg room. The passenger in front of me kept trying to recline his seat, which almost placed his head in my lap and made it nearly impossible to watch a movie, which may or may not have been a good thing because their inflight entertainment leaves a lot to be desired. The movie screen is only about 4” X 6”, and my entertainment system continually crashed. We rarely saw flight attendants throughout the flight and even if you pressed the call button, no one came. The meals/snacks were less than mediocre. The one snack we received was a tuna salad sandwich. When I asked if they had any other sandwich choice, the flight attendant asked if I had requested a special meal due to food allergies. When I told her no, she went and got me 2 small packets of their crackers. Beverage service was lacking, twice I asked for a glass of water, I never received it. About 2 hours into the flight, I used the bathroom, only to find less than 1/4 roll of toilet paper sitting on the sink counter. ",,,,,
" Never been to Italy before, first time to write a review before take off! It’s all about the leg room. I am already in a lot of discomfort and we haven’t even taken off. There is zero leg room. I am worried that if the passenger in front reclined by even an inch, I will suffer an untimely death. I really should have done my homework, but as this is the National carrier etc, I assumed it would be the best.",,,,,
"I bought an Alitalia ticket and I called and confirmed with Alitalia customer service that economy tickets included a checked bag. The customer service representative confirmed that I had a checked bag. When I arrived at the airport, they refused to check my bag unless I paid $60 each way. Obviously, it was too late at that point to pack a carry-on so I was forced to pay an extra $240 dollars ($120 round trip for myself and my boyfriend) for our bags. They told me I had a ""light"" ticket, but it didn't say that on my ticket. They said that economy tickets included a bag, but light tickets did not. Alitalia overcharged us for the bags. I contacted them after the incident on September 20, 2019, and the automated email noted that they would respond to us within 30 days. It's now 46 days later and I'm still waiting for a resolution.

"  I flew Alitalia return Rome to Delhi return in business class and the on-time performance was perfect. On the DEL-FCO flight we landed 15 minute ahead of schedule after leaving DEL airport on the exact scheduled time. When entering the aircraft the steward did not great us, did not smile, did not look at the boarding pass to show me my seat. Bins were occupied by blankets and needed to ask a stewardess to remove them, which she did with an accusing expression as if it was my fault that the blankets were there. The food was heralded as inspired by a famous restaurant, but in reality was not. When serving the meal,  crew was polite, but no smile or interaction to me. During the night nobody came through the cabin to offer a glass of water or a snack. The galley had a bottle of water and Coca Cola, but no snacks. The water was served in a plastic beaker. Before landing, none of the crew asked if we had had a pleasant flight. When leaving the aircraft, no pleasantries, no smile to me. ",,,,,

"  Catania to Boston via Rome. At Catania Airport when we were informed our flight was cancelled but not given a reason. One person at the service desk said it was the weather-other flights were leaving and arriving, others said it was a transport strike- We needed a written reason to fullfil the terms of our travel insurance. A service person said we could get the answer on line. He tried but could not produce a website with the answer. We were bused from Catania 1.5 hrs to Comiso Airport - we never received new tickets and were simply boarded on a flight to Rome. We missed our connection to Boston and were bused to a 3rd rate hotel in suburban Rome, offered a dinner of pasta and pork (which we don't eat) and told to be up at 6 am the next day for a flight leaving for Boston at 10:55 am. Breakfast was a bag with a bottle of water, dried cracker, stale croissant, and juice box. The flight to Boston was horrendous. The meal choicewas gone by the time the attendent came by - she offered me her meal which was very kind. The entertainment offerings were horrible and for me the system didn't work and wifi never worked. When I checked on several flight tracker sites AZ 1724 was listed as departing from Catania!",,,,,
" Belgrade to New Delhi via Rome. 7th October, 2019 was my birthday. And it was the worst birthday of my life. Thanks to Alitalia's customer service support staffs. I was supposed to travel from Belgrade (AZ591) to New Delhi (AZ770) via Rome. The first flight was delayed by almost an hour as a result missed the next flight to Delhi. Nobody in Rome was willing to help. After running from pillar to post finally found someone who took all the time in the world (at least 2 hours) to inform that next flight is after 24 hours. No facility was provided except for two meal coupons. No accommodation, no visa, no lounge access. Stranded with no facilities and no luggage and was suggested to sleep on seats and survive 24 hours in cold. Surprised to see this service especially when name of Etihad is associated. I had a connecting train from Delhi next morning which I missed. I am still figuring out how to do further journey as I am not able to secure any ticket now. Their customer support team was pathetic in Rome. Sorry to use such strong word. But they cannot communicate. Their knowledge is limited. And on top of everything I did not find them humane. Especially in hospitality sectors these features are so much needed. I never thought this is the way they will compensate their customers by adding more misery to their suffering for which they are responsible in the first place.",,,,,
" I flew from Moscow to Palermo, with a transfer in Milan on October 3, flight number AZ7027. Upon arrival in Palermo, my luggage was lost. I contacted the Lost and Found, the staff promised me that they would deliver my luggage to the hotel early in the morning of October 4th. As a result, my luggage was delivered only in the evening at 8 o’clock! All this time I had to be in discomfort and without the basic hygiene products that your company had to offer. Then on October 5, my flight was again your company flight number AZ1790 with a transfer in Milan. At check-in, I asked you to deliver my luggage directly to Moscow. An employee of your company began to claim that I need to wait a day at Milan airport! When my stopover duration was to be only 1 hour 10 minutes. It was her mistake, she did not give me a boarding pass to Moscow and sent my luggage only to Milan. She scared me very much and made me nervous! Before flying to Milan, other airport employees announced me and said that there was a mistake and they gave me a boarding pass to Moscow. I asked several times, was my baggage redirected to Moscow? They claimed that yes, everything is fine. You will receive your luggage in Moscow. Then when I arrived in Moscow, my luggage was lost again. It's just awful and this is the first time I've met so much disgusting service! As a result, I was able to get my luggage on October 7th! Very disappointed and will never use it again. Ruined my vacation.",,,,,
  I booked a return flight to my mum who is unable to walk long distance. I arranged assistance at the airport and into the aircraft to help her to move during her trip. This was planned long time in advance. She was back from her journey and she did not have any issues in the other flights until she arrived at Verona airport where they denied her assistance and they charged her extra fee. Assistance was free and she did not pay in all the other trips. Furthermore despite her showing her e-ticket to the check in desk where it was clearly written that assistance and luggage were included they charged for it as well. She was travelling alone and it was a really unpleasant and unacceptable experience. I strongly recommend not to take any connection to Verona.,,,,,
" August 28, 2019, I was traveling with my disabled stepmother and a child with scoliosis from Athens, Greece to Malta (AZ 717) with a change in Rome (flight AZ 884). The flight from Athens to Rome was delayed 2 hours and as a result, we missed our connection flight (AZ884) from Rome to Malta and had to spend 9 hours 40 minutes in Rome instead of 2 hours 25 minutes. The explanation I got when I complained about such a huge unexpected layover in Rome from Alitalia was: “Our records show flight AZ717 was delayed due to the late arrival of the incoming aircraft due to crew rest. Under EU Regulation EC 261/2004 (Art. 5.3 and Recital 14) the carrier does not assume liability when flights are delayed due to “extraordinary circumstances”. What extraordinary circumstances? Earthquake? Tornado? Wind? Rain “cats and dogs” so the other Alitalia flight was so delayed that the crew had to rest? I do not recall any of the above-mentioned disasters happening. Or it is just a conspiracy way to trick customer for not reimbursing/helping/accommodating them when most likely the delay happened because of the technical issues with the planes and it is Alitalia fault for which they should answer? Continuation: Upon arrival to Rome We we not offered help for a disabled person (it is quite difficult to sit in the chair for 9 hours 40 min), neither phone call, no food coupons as required by Under EU Regulation EC 261/2004 (Art. 5.3 and Recital 14), though we talked to the representatives in the disabled ""lounge"" upon arrival in Rome asking what we could be offered to help us go through the 9 hours plus of the delay (Just to mention, I paid higher price for the tickets to spend as little time during the layover as possible and ended up with 9 hours). To help my child with scoliosis and disabled stepmother go though this horrible not planned delay I purchased 2 entry passes (50.00 USD each) to the business class lounge assuming that would solve two problems: food and provide comfort in seating/laying flat in the lounge for two sick persons. If I were to go to the restaurants to feed all three of us I am sure during 9 hours 40 minutes layover we will spend way more then 100.00 combined (and I do not even ask to reimburse anything for myself). Of course, I complained about the delay and applied for 100.00 USD paid for the 2 passes (only 2, not 3). And here is the answer I received from Alitalia: ""depending on the length of the delay, the airline is required to provide the necessary care and assistance as phone call, meals and refreshments, or reimburse the expenses for meals and beverages based on the relevant receipts. However, we regret to advise that the complimentary access to VIP lounges is not subject to this provision, therefore we are not able to refund the lounge access you purchased at Rome airport”. Looks like Alitalia does not care about its passengers at all only about filling its pockets. Next: Before the flight In Athens I tried to pay for excess weight online but the Alitalia website got frozen all the time when I got to the point when I was supposed to pay. I was constantly trying for a few hours but could not pay the internet price 28.00 USD per bag versus what I had to pay in the airport 50 USD.",,,,,
"  Catania to Milan. My sister and I won't use Alitalia never again, for sure. We paid GBP 78 for our luggage allowance, however, they lost our luggage for days. My sister, that was visiting me in London, had to fly back to Buenos Aires without her original luggage and belongings. She had to buy new suitcase + basic things to be able to come back and, despite all these expenses generated and documented, they have denied her any compensation. Absolutely disrespectful, never again for us.",,,,,
"  I booked an Alitalia Flight from Genoa to Johannesburg for Monday 9th September. Flying out at 19:00 and arriving Johannesburg 9:00 on Tuesday 10th. While checking in for my first flight at 17:00 I received a mail that my flight from Rome to Johannesburg  had been cancelled and I would be rescheduled on a flight the following morning. At the customer service desk I was instructed to request a refund for my ticket. Once arriving in Rome I asked at customer service and was told I could only do this online. The following morning I was put on a 9:00 flight to JHB which was then again delayed for another 1.5hrs. I arrived in JHB at 20:00 on the 10th so an entire day of work lost. I also received an email instructing me to request a refund for my cancelled flight. The following day I called the Alitalia call center for South Africa, they informed me that I had to email [email protected] which I did, twice and I have had no response after 5 days. This is the third flight cancellation that I have experienced with Alitalia.",,,,,
"  Toronto to Rome. The best part about taking the premium economy with Alitalia is the Priority Check-in and also the distinct compartment that separates the 18 seats from Economy and Business. It also has its own toilet although on our flight it was out of order. The seats were also a lot more comfortable than standard economy. After those advantages the rest was not much better than standard economy. The food service was ho-hum and there was no liquor available even on a trans Atlantic flight. The flight attendants were adequate in terms of attentiveness but no more. The priority check-in, Priority baggage handling and comfortable seats were worth the added cost.",,,,,
"  Geneva to Rome. Adorable personnel, helpful, I recommend this airline, my flight was cancelled one day ago and they allowed me to the lounge to wait, offered me breakfast and lunch.",,,,,
"  Dusseldorf to Delhi via Rome. Upon arrival to Delhi, I was told my baggage was not boarded on the plane. They said it will be delivered by next flight. Next day, they said the baggage is misplaced or lost. Asked for me to fill long forms and give proofs of my residence, work etc. In the mean time I had to buy basic clothes and toiletries (as nothing was offered by the airline). However 8 days later, I finally received my baggage but the locks were broken, the suitcase was tampered with and some items missing. It was a gross case of negligence and mishandling. In order to compensate the airline offered a meager sum of €100 euros. Would never fly again and would not recommend it. ",,,,,
"  Milan to Cagliari. Wasn't taking an Alitalia flight for years, and was expecting the worse. Funny enough, I've found decent service and reasonably clean aircraft, with good knee space. Flight attendants looked stressed, but didn't disappoint. Surely will choose Alitalia  again, at least for short range flights.",,,,,
"  Amsterdam to Johannesburg via Rome. Where does one begin? Send delay information emails and confirmation after it already happened. Poor staff service, very unfriendly. No support to single mothers with children, can't even get receive a bottle of water on request. Everything asked seems to be too much of a hassle or inconvenience for the staff. Refuse to speak another language to some customers while gladly speak the same language to other customers. Will never fly with Alitalia again. Our friends warned us about the shocking service and thought it can't be so bad, but it's very bad indeed.",,,,,
"  Our group of four took Alitalia from Chicago to Rome on 06/26/2019 and returned to Chicago 07/03/2019. We had a flight that left Chicago at 3:30 p.m. Once we took off the employees came around and gave us some food that was ok. By 5:30p.m. the employees told the passengers to pull down the window shades so the inside of the plane was dark. I believe their intent was to make everyone go to sleep and not bother the staff during the flight. I do not go to sleep at 5:30 in the afternoon and did not sleep during any of the flight! The staff did not come through the plane to check on passengers for hours during the flight and I had to go search for one of them to get a drink of water. I think the staff went to sleep during the flight. On the way back to Chicago we left Rome at 9:30 a.m. and again were told to pull down the shades. While this may work well for people who want to sleep during the day I believe it was again done so the steward and stewardess could ignore the passengers. When the staff did come through the airplane with what they called food they were rude and curt if any of the passengers wanted to ask any questions about the ""food"". Some of the passengers are allergic to various ingredients and the airline employees did not show any interest in answering questions about the food. I would not recommend this airline. ",,,,,
  The worst airline ever.  My luggage was lost on July 27. July 29 they called me to tell me they found my luggage and will ship to me. They never shipped but closed the file. Since then I have called and emailed and they have yet to reopen file which means my luggage will not be sent and no-one will look for it if its lost. ,,,,,
"  Bari to London via Rome and had 2 very different flight experiences.  I booked my flights several months ahead of travel for my summer holiday and found the Alitalia site to be very efficient and user friendly. Alitalia emailed me a reminder to check-in online and so that side of things proved to be impressive and reliable. Check-in at Bari was quick and the gentleman who checked me in made pleasant small talk and was very polite. The flight from Bari to Rome was on an A320, the aircraft was clean and the interior well presented. Boarding was well managed and the flight departed slightly early and reached Rome 10 mins ahead of schedule. During this short flight the friendly and well turned out crew served drinks and were a great credit to their company. Disembarkation was most efficient and orderly. I transferred from the domestic terminal to terminal E for the flight to London. This flight was on a clearly older A320. Boarding was not orderly as too many passengers had far too much hand luggage. The flight was delayed for over 90 minutes on the runway and no announcements were made by the captain at all. Most of the cabin crew disappeared and left one lady to try and answer questions from worried passengers. One passenger was told that storms over London had caused the delay and another person said there was power failure at Heathrow. This was all hearsay and not at all beneficial to passengers. I noted how a captain from another airline was treated like a king by the cabin crew. He was placed by the emergency seat and another passenger moved to enable this. Two Mexican ladies sat next to me and were concerned about missing their flight to Mexico City. The same cabin crew member who fussed over the captain waved her hands at the Mexicans and said it was not her job to know about connecting flights. During this flight a small drink was served and a snack consisting of a micro packet of biscuits. When I arrived at Heathrow I found that my case had been broken. I had to find a place to report this and was assisted by a young man who was clearly not coping well. Apparently quite a few bags on the flight did not even arrive in London.  I shall hesitate to use Alitalia for international flights but should I  need a domestic flight, I shall consider them! The poor communication was a great concern and the indifferent staff on the Rome to London flight were a cause for concern.",,,,,
"  Cairo to New York via Rome. I would not recommend this airline, they are apart of the sky team alliance and I purchase my ticket through delta but feel as though I’ve been ripped off. The employees of this airline is rude both on the plane and at the gate. ",,,,,
"  New York to Athens via Rome. There was an elderly man in front of us with a cane and needed help, as he boarded none of the stewardess bothered to look at him. The crew did not greet us as we entered the airplane, did not help anybody on the plane, did not crack one smile. When food was served it was basically tossed at us. Later as the lights went out I pressed the call button and asked for water. It took her 15 minutes to get me a glass of water. I would not recommend this airline.",,,,,
"  Munich to Pisa via Rome. I found out there is a strike at my layover airport. I understand there is nothing you can do immediately to prevent strikes. But how do I only find out my connection takes twice as long when I check in? With no reason given at all? Ok there is a note in the email that notifies me about cancelled flights with no further information to talk to a ticketing officer where one can ask for passenger rights. Thus i explain my situation to random alitalia employees to find it. After half an hour later I am at an empty booth. Other airport empoyees explain me where the real booth is and that i should ask for a ticket. After half an hour my number is called. I go there, they explain me to wait in line because the system does not work right now. But the line does not move at all since some passengers are arriving with Alitalia employees to be injected at the front of the line. Finally after 1:30 hours later i can explain my situation to the person i have been referred to countless times. I ask her about the compensation policy for delayed flights and my passenger rights, yet she only refers me to the website. After multiple requests she writes down the address of the website in my notebook. If this is truly the only way to file complaints, I would have expected this to be communicated beforehand and not 2h after I spoke with the first Alitalia ground personnel about the matter. I am seriously disappointed in the service you are providing, your communication policy and how you are handling complaints.",,,,,
"  Amsterdam to Beirut via Rome. A sky priority platinum member story: Not only we were delayed on all the segments, not enough that our flight was delayed and we missed the connection, They made us stand in line for hours without any and when arrived to role they made us stand up in line for another hour, I was informed that it's better and safer to keep my luggage with them and that it's 100% it will arrive to destination, when asked for it still they said I'll have to wait for 2 hours for them to bring it so I chose to follow their direction and leave it with them, no surprise here the luggage was not sent but also lost. The night In Rome they sent me to a hotel. After an hour of waiting in line the hotel tells me that the airline sent them another memo and that they will send me to another hotel. We landed at 12 midnight and I reached my room at 4 am after all the hassle. The next morning flight was delayed again 1 hour,  and of course no luggage. Mean, unethical, careless, and notorious for bad service.",,,,,
" Flew Rome to Bari roundtrip. FCO-BRI: Used Kiosk check-in without problem. Upon boarding, staff screened passengers for carry-on baggage to make sure the it's within the 8-kg weight limit. And I had to pay for 1-kg overweight at 49 euro price. I was to move some contents out of my luggage into my backpack. The staff said the backpack also has weight limit. Seemed like I was destined to pay up. T1 is a mad house. The domestic (or regional) flights use the gates at tarmac level. There was hardly any place to sit down. Many people resorted to the floor. Leaning on the wall and space was a rare commodity. Flight was slight delayed as taking more time using buses to remote stands as my plane was parked at the far end. BRI-FCO: I knew I will be definitely overweight on my luggage after Greek island hopping trip. I purchased the luggage for this sector. Checked in at a Kiosk which was slow and stalled and took forever about 5 to complete. Luggage drop was not accepted as only one flight at a time. There was a flight leaving before mine so the luggage had to be dropped at a designated time. It was quick domestic hops. Beverage service on board was offered on both legs. Seat pitch is good.",,,,,
"  We flew from Cagliari to Milan Linate on an A320. Check in lines were long but fortunately we arrived early. Fortunately we were not charged for excess baggage. Hand luggage allowance is I believe only about 8 kilos. We left on time and the crew were very friendly. We also were served a drink and a very nice packet of crisps. In general I was pleasantly surprised by the professional, friendly crew.",,,,,
  Athens to Rome. The flight was cheap so I was a little skeptic especially considering I didn't fly Alitalia since 3 years but the experience was really good and there was plenty of soft drinks and helpful cabin crew.,,,,,
  Terrible seat in premium economy. Seat was broken and wouldn’t properly recline. The main purpose I purchased premium economy was to be able to recline and sleep on my 13hr flight. I asked the attendant for help fixing the seat and she simply said she didn’t remember how to fix it and dismissed me. Movies worked but the picture quality was out of the 80s. Grainy and poor colors. Also it was a challenge to figure it out. Last year I flew EVA air to Vietnam for exactly half the price and twice the quality. It’s really no wonder Alitalia is in the brink of bankruptcy.,,,,,
"  Catania to Rome. Bought my ticket with window seat and checked in the night before with luggage. When I arrived at airport for baggage drop off, they charged me extra for luggage and downgraded my seat to middle all the while pretending to not understand English and refusing service. I hope others does not have to go through the same treatment.",,,,,
"  Catania to Rome. Worst airline experience I've encountered. Horrible customer service and no organization in their ticketing process. My flight was delayed and I had to go back through security to talk to a lady at the checkout counter. After waiting over an hour, I was yelled at and told to go stand in another line. Alitalia should be ashamed of their customer service and their poor management.",,,,,
"  Bucharest to Milan. No respect for SkyTeam customers, especially elite plus customers, that pay a lot in order to fly only this team! After talking to customer service you may need therapy, so never try to ask for their help. Actually avoid this company. I will surely never ever fly Alitalia again. They will even sell your ticket to a cheap company and pretend they don’t care of any status you have. Should get excluded from SkyTeam immediately. Make you pay for your luggage, seats and you don’t get any attention even as a Platinum Member! Didn’t allow lounge, with Alitalia ticket and Platinum membership!",,,,,
"  Bari to Rome. Terrible experience. They lost my luggage, then shortly before I could have claim compensation they have lost it again. Customer service was not helpful at all and always took very long on calls.",,,,,
"  Catania to Tel Aviv via Rome. I booked a flight a few months in advance, with a 12 hour stopover in Rome on my way back from Catania to Tel-Aviv. On the day before my return flight, while attempting to check in online, I found out that Alitalia has changed the time of my CTA-FCO flight from the morning to the evening, thus reducing my layover in Rome to two hours. They did this a few days before the flight, without alerting me to the fact that they're changing my itinerary (my understanding is that an Airline is not allowed to change the itinerary within 14 days from the flight, and that they must notify the passenger). Since I had plans in Rome, I contacted Alitalia by phone. From here on my experience was truly unbelievable. The first representative I spoke to, told me that my original flight was canceled, and there's nothing she can do. But I had reasons to suspect that the flight was not canceled (it was possible to purchase tickets for the flight online). Since she refused to acknowledge this, I asked whether I could be placed on some other morning flight. The representative responded that she can't find any available flight. Then she told me that there is a regional problem and all morning flights from Catania are canceled - which, as I found out after the call ended, had no connection with reality. I called again, after verifying online that it's possible to book my original itinerary on the Alitalia web site. I also spoke with several colleagues who attended the same conference as me, and none of them were notified of any flight cancellations. The same representative got my call. She told me now that she simply cannot offer me my original itinerary, even though the flight was not canceled, and that the airline has the right to do this (which is incorrect). She offered me some other choices which were completely irrelevant to me, and explained to me that I must accept one of these offers. I asked to speak with a supervisor but she refused to let me do this (claiming that all supervisors are away, or in a meeting, depending on the time I asked). She also kept demanding that I check availability online once more, but as I was traveling I wasn't able to talk on the phone and access the web at the same (this, she said, was 'my problem'). After 45 minutes of futile attempts to get this representative to help me, I ended the call and called again. This time I reached another representative. This one started by repeating the incorrect claim that my original flight was canceled. But I confronted her with the fact that the flight was being sold on the Alitalia web site. She then acknowledged that the flight was not canceled, but claimed that she cannot put me on my original itinerary anyway. I insisted. After a lengthy discussion she asked that I wait (probably seeking assistance from a more senior team member), and finally placed me on the itinerary that I booked. I wasted overall an hour and a half on this, and missed several talks in the conference that I attended. By the way: there were a number of empty seats on the flight, so there was absolutely no logical incentive for refusing to put me on it. The whole experience felt like pure harassment. Seems like Alitalia representatives are simply trained to do as little as possible to assist passengers. This is either a policy of the airline, or perhaps the representative are super lazy and incompetent, and nobody in this airline cares.",,,,,
" Rome to Buenos Aires. I had to run to the gate as my Alitalia connecting flight from Milan arrived late (they did wait for us though). The plane cabin was relatively well maintained, IFE was working properly (even though the screens and the choice could be improved). The service was quite quick and the food quite tasty (as you would expect by an Italian airline). There's definitely room for improvement but overall I was pleasantly surprised.",,,,,
"  Mexico City to Rome. Seats were very uncomfortable. The screens didn't work during the flight. The crew didn't answer when the button was pushed to call them. I asked for gluten and lactose free meal, and my meal had lactose products which i didn't noticed and made me feel awful during the flight.",,,,,
"  Rome to London. Historically my flights with Alitalia have never been pleasant, most frequent occurrence the lost baggage. Surprisingly, regardless of its financial position, Alitalia has improved. Flights were on time, baggage wasn't lost, and service was decent. The pre-flight auction for business class is also a great idea. Well, the lack of politeness of an Italian cabin crew, and the ridiculously narrow seat pitch are not a surprise at all.",,,,,
"  Barcelona to Istanbul via Rome. Check in was appalling. A customer service staff was so rude that a colleague of his came to my assistance. I could not remove my old airline tag from my check in luggage,& his reply was that it was my problem,& wouldn’t even help me, after asking him several times, & informing him that I couldn’t remove it. He refused to check in my luggage & then his colleague ignored him & helped out.  I will not fly Alitalia again.",,,,,
"  Montenegro to Cairo via Rome. Worst airline I've ever taken and the rudest staff on and off the plane. I heard so many bad things about Alitalia before but never thought it would be this bad. After a 6 hour delay, they didn't even bother to do anything about it, no one cares. My grandma needs to be on a wheelchair and there was no assistance what so ever, in fact, after they got her a wheelchair they left her at the rome airport at a random gate without even checking where she wanted to go and they took the wheelchair away from her after we explained she couldnt move without it! They were extremely rude and impolite, and couldn't care less. Not recommended even if it is the cheapest flight available, you will be frustrated the whole time, it's not worth it at all. Huge disappointment, never flying Alitalia again.",,,,,
  I took this flight from London to Delhi via Rome. Airline did not give any information about the terminal and the gate for the connection from Rome. Crew was extremely rude. Flight was delayed by 2 hours because of detour it had to take. Captain/crew did not provide any information on the delay. There was delay in baggage arrival and it was mixed with other airlines luggage. Ground staff had no information on delay.,,,,,
"  Boston to Rome (Fiumicino) with Alitalia. We paid for a premium economy seat and just 72 hours before the flight they changed the plane and kicked us to economy without any explanation. They were rude when we tried to call them and offered no help when we were very confused. When we got to the airport the checkin staff were extremely rude and just wanted us to go away. I kid you not the was the most uncomfortable flight I have ever been on. The crew only wanted to serve you on their schedule and woke me up to ""Chicken or Beef?"" I never received an explanation why we were kicked out but we were partially refunded.",,,,,
  Rome to Athens. This must be the worst flight I have ever had. One of the most uncomfortable planes I have ever been on. Rude air hostesses which where talking down to passengers and giggling all through the flight at the back of the plane. I am surprised they are still allowed to fly with such service and state of aircraft. Only positive in the whole trip was the ground staff service at transfer desk.,,,,,
" Sao Paulo to Rome via Milan. I had no problem during the flight, but the after sales is terrible. I sent an email asking to transfer the miles to a Alitalia's partner air company and since January I got no reply from them. I tried to call Brazilian branch but they said I should send an e-mail to Alitalia and wait a reply. Now my time to request the miles has expired and I just lost it because Alitalia did not reply any of the e-mails.",,,,,
"  Rome to Athens. We took an early morning flight to save money, only brought one suitcase that met all the requirements online. Upon arrival, they said our bags were too big (they were soft so they fit in the box but they measured it using a weird machine that didn’t compact it) and charged us 90€, more than we paid for our miserable early morning tickets. We’ve never had a problem with these suitcases meeting dimensions, we’ve flown over 20 times with them on airlines with the same requirements. We’re now not going to be able to do much at our destination because they made us pay such an insane additional amount.",,,,,
"  We booked two tickets from Munich to Rome via the Alitalia Homepage and got a direct confirmation. At the airport, we were informed by very unfriendly and slow staff that we would not be on the passenger list and Alitalia cannot transport us with the booked flight and we shall buy another ticket in an Alitalia flight 6 hrs later. The staff denied to provide contact to her boss and did not give her name. We had to book another one-way-flight on the same day with another company, spend 380€ extra. When arriving in Rome, we again contacted a service staff. She was much more friendly and informed us that Alitalia had some software problems resulting in bookings via the internet not being correctly processed internally. She promised that our costs will be reimbursed. We then contacted Alitalia to get our reimbursement. Unfortunately, although we spent much time to precisely indicate all circumstances and additional costs, Alitalia only reimbursed the 254€ for the original ticket but did not reimburse the additional costs of 380€ for the extra flight to Rome (and we had to pay another 250€ for the flight back from Rome). Furthermore, and most disappointing, Alitalia did neither give an explanation nor an excuse. We will never fly Alitalia again!",,,,,
"  Barcelona to Rome. The agent made us check the weight of every single bag we had, even hand bags, we consolidated and reconsolidated, checked 3 bags and paid the extra costs for the bags and still Alitalia lost our luggage. Worst customer service, they could care less that your luggage is lost and do nothing to even try to help.  How does no one know where my luggage is and why are the customer service agents so horribly trained.",,,,,
" 
This was my second time flying with Alitalia to Johannesburg and I have to say that the first time was better than this. The aircraft were all clean and the crew from LHR to FCO were pleasant enough. However the all male crew to Johannesburg, although not rude, tried very hard not to interact with the passengers. I saw one flight attendant smile the whole flight. It is sad that the crew all looked like they would rather have been elsewhere. During the night there was not a sign of them and compared to other airlines that really lets them down.",,,,,
"  Amsterdam to Athens via Rome. Alitalia currently offers by far the cheapest deals in premium segments and so I booked another roundtrip to ATH, like I did last year. The flight also offered me 60 XP at a bargain. Hard and soft product more or less same as previous flights. This time I pre booked a Seafood meal and certainly did not regret. Meal was of much better quality then the standard Pasta dishes. Alitalia offers a hotel on all segments (ATH-FCO is just 1h35). Staff friendly and lounge in ATH is very good. Sky Priority well organized. All flights on time except last flight into AMS minor delay due to heavy wind at AMS. Crew has nice new uniforms. Also in economy I noticed they still offer some basic service, a nibble and a beverage on all flights uphill 3hrs. WiFi available Will certainly fly again!",,,,,
"  Frankfurt to Florence via Rome. We will never fly with Alitalia again. We arrived at the airport in Germany with plenty of time to spare and got stuck in security. When I say stuck, I mean we stood in line not moving for almost an hour. We got to the gate and they would not let us in, nor would they help us rebook. This cost us $1400 to book through another flight and a hotel for the night. ",,,,,
" 
Alitalia's Premium Economy is a very comfortable way to fly. On our recent trip from Amsterdam to Cape Town, we booked Premium Economy and - good to know - unlike others, Alitalia will put you in Business Class on connecting flights that don't have Premium Economy. A huge step up from many of the other airlines that will seat you in Economy. So those flights come with complimentary lounge access. Lounge in Amsterdam provided by KLM, which is just OK. Business class on board Alitalia is pretty standard but seats do have adjustable armrest that create a slightly wider seat, ample pitch and a little table in between seats that folds down. I was quite impressed with the catering, a traditional set up with a good pasta, salad and dessert. Service was fine. Connection in Rome is really easy as you are leaving the EU (no security). Our flight to JoBurg left on time with an early arrival. This is important because if the flight is late it will be handled at a remote stand, which easily adds 30 minutes to getting through the arrival process. Alitalia's premium economy is wonderful. Really comfy seats with great recline, quite adequate for sleeping. Avoid the first row, because leg space is really reduced there. seats are in a 2-3-2 arrangement with 2 rows on the side and 3 in the middle. Second window row is really the best. A nice amenity kit was handed out, pre departure bubbles in plastic cups. Meal service was upgraded and somewhere in between economy and business class. Proper linens, china and silverware were used. I had a great sleep on this flight. Breakfast was very basic. Service from the staff could be warmer, but nothing to get upset about. Arrival in Joburg was okay with a short wait at immigration. Alitalia sells a connection to Cape Town (which we took) on SAA, but they 'don't partner' which means if anything happens that will make you miss your connection they will point fingers to each other. We made our connection but trying to make some sort of a change in the trip was impossible because of this.",,,,,
" We returned from Cape Town to Amsterdam via Johannesburg and Rome. The first sector was on SAA. Johannesburg is a tricky airport to transfer from domestic to international. Terminals are far apart and it requires re-check-in, security and passport control, then more long distance walking. Our 1H30 connecting time just got us as last passengers onto AZ's flight to Rome with minutes to spare. The club cabin on AZ's A330 is nice with incredibly comfortable, private and spacious seating. All window seats are singles, slightly staggered so some are closer to the windows then others, but all allow for good views from the windows. AZ's amenity kit is gorgeous. Proper printed menus for food and wine were handed out. Pre-departure bubbles, water and juice, international papers followed. Although AZ's pillow is of disposable quality the pillow case is beautiful and the blanket is fine too. AZ is obviously taking on-time performance seriously. All our flights left spot on time or early. Dinner started quickly after take off. Alitalia sets individual tables (no trays), this gives almost a First class feeling. Beautiful linens, glass and silverware. Dinner is a five course affair of solid quality. The pasta dish was gorgeous (and a full meal by itself). So far AZ's product is with the absolute top. The only aspect that could be better is the staff. They are so 'rough around the edges' and most interactions are 'rusty'. They are okay but not overly friendly or proactive. It seems they avoid interaction. What a pity because this created a rather 'frosty' atmosphere in the cabin. The purser did not make any effort to interact although she was constantly in the cabin with paperwork, dealing with her team as if we were not there. No welcome, 'how are you' or goodbye's from her. Sleeping on board is fine although the cabin was too hot, luckily window seats have individual vents. Seats in the middle don't so I would avoid those seats. Breakfast was rather 'Italian' with no options and sweets only. Also breakfast was served in total darkness, which I gather is not a problem for passengers (who have individual lights) but I guess not ideal for the staff. Arrival was on-time but Rome airport was it's usual mess. We enjoyed our Alitalia flight and recommend it.",,,,,
" Flew back to Brazil in Alitalia Business class. Short hop from LHR to FCO was nice, all good, lounge at Rome is as good as any in the world simply because its food is great! The long-haul flight back to GRU was same type of aircraft as the outbound and similarly ""tired"". Very old entertainment system even in Business class. I do like Alitalia's flat bed seat, I do find it very comfortable. Food was not up to scratch. The menu was quite limited and uninspiring for premium cabin. Campari was great as always. The pasta was a little burned, the fish was tiny and of poor quality. I was very disappointed as I have always raved about Alitalia's food. The flight was very uncomfortable as there was a lot of turbulence, I was unable to sleep at all. I felt the pilot could have done more, he ""cruised"" at the same altitude for from the third hour of the flight when in my experience others have tried to look for more comfortable reaches, maybe there were ATC considerations, I don't know, but it was a pretty horrid flight and I did feel a lack of consideration from the front.",,,,,
" 
So these 777 that Alitalia now fly are getting quite tired. Seats in economy are very hard. I had a ""comfort"" seat on the long-haul flight from Sao Paulo to Rome so I had extra leg room. I got mine for free as I am platinum with Air France, however otherwise it would have cost US$150 and consequently I imagine those that did pay would have been outraged that staff allowed people to move to vacant exit seats after take off. The meal was satisfactory and probably above average for airline food. Entertainment system very old, but a couple of good films so job done I guess. Thankfully I had the prospect of lunch in one of my favourite lounges (Rome) in the world to cheer me up as I crossed the Atlantic. The flight was cheap, for the price good value albeit even in ""comfort class"" not very comfortable.",,,,,
"  Rome to Pisa. My first experience with this company was really bad. First, the flight is delayed for one hour and the second I haven't received my baggage and still waiting to be found.",,,,,
"  
Berlin to Rome. I had Flying Blue points to redeem so I used them for my flight from Berlin to Rome. I was a bit apprehensive at first with Alitalia being in receivership after having been ditched by Etihad. But I proceeded anyway knowing that in the unlikely event that the airline goes belly up, I still have other options. As with most intra-European flights, Alitalia offers basic snack service on board. A drink and a snack, either sweet or salty was being served on this 2 hour flight. As I was seated in the exit row, leg space was generous. Seats were leather seats in black. Flight attendants were smartly dressed in black pant suit with scarf emblazoned with Alitalia colours.",,,,,
"  I was stupid enough to booked my ticket for today’s flight from Algiers via Rome to Munich (in business class) with Alitalia. When I came to the check in counter I was forced to check in my carry on trolley because the combined weight of trolley and laptop bag was 17 kg (more than the limit of 16 kg, because I carried quite a bit of work related paper). I asked for the station manager who came and insisted I must check this in, he did not accept my to carry my laptop or some papers separately. I always travel with my trolley and laptop bag and on long trips an additional suit bag as carry on basically all the world airlines who – other than Alitalia – understand that business travellers who pay for an expensive do not like to waste their time by waiting half an hour on checked baggage to arrive. Too bad that Alitalia does not like business travellers - I certainly draw the conclusion to book my flights with other airlines in the future!",,,,,
"  Rome to Belgrade. This was my first and last flight with Alitalia. I was so excited to get on this flight once we came to the airport the staff were so rude, no smile no nothing. Onboard my seat was taken by someone else and I have asked to sit next to my wife as we already booked our tickets in advance and booked our seats as well. I was told if there is more space you can move to a different seat if not then just need to stay in my current seat. we took off 1hr 45min late, seats were not comfy at all very hard and no space. The service was ok once we took off nothing special. once we were coming to a land into Belgrade the aeroplane kept on dropping and quiet a few passengers were screaming. ",,,,,
"  Mumbai to Paris via Rome. Alitalia has pathetic customer service. I got all my baggage misplaced and getting delivered to me after 3 days. Due to their irresponsible behaviour I had to spend ~150 Euros and now when I requested them to bring my amount back, they first offer me 30 Euros and later 70 Euros stating that's maximum they can offer. Despite sharing all the bills, and continues follow-up, I haven't been able to get any success. ",,,,,
"  Brussels to Seoul via Rome. Staff on board was friendly, basic entertainment. My experience was quite satisfactory. I was very dissatisfied with my luggage. It had severe damage and inside many of my goods were damaged. They wouldn't compensate me for this issue. The customer agent says it needs to be reported after you claimed the damage at the airport itself. I think this will be my last flight with Alitalia.",,,,,
  Delhi to Barcelona via Rome. Not only my experience with them before the flight was horrible. The flight was the worst I've ever traveled. ,,,,,
"  I have travelled with Alitalia for more than 20 years, and though out this time quality of service and employees’ attitude has been going up and down. In the last three trips however I experienced the worst possible service on both sides. Old plane flying the intercontinental route (low cost type of searing, front and back seats broken). Poor food quality as well as entertainment. The attitude of the crew was terrible. You can manage one person with a bad day, but when three or four through the journey are unnecessarily unpleasant. I really wish I had more options to fly out of Miami.",,,,,
"  Brussels to Rome. Really nice cabin crew, clean plane. Flight comfortable and fast, we landed in Rome even 30 minutes before, they allowed me to arrive on time on Christmas Eve. I will fly again with Alitalia",,,,,
" London (LHR) to Milan (LIN). Boarding was quick and efficient, flight departed on time and cabin crew were very friendly. The aircraft was clean, seats were comfortable and the price was excellent. I strongly recommend Alitalia.",,,,,
"  Delhi to Rome. Horrible flight.  Unprofessional and unkind flight crew, nothing was served to me for first 6 hrs of flight, not even water or beverages. Crew was unpleasant when I asked for water and then for coffee later.",,,,,
"  Flew Rome to Barcelona and I found them to be fine. They were on time, the flight attendants were courteous and efficient, and they got my luggage on board the flight properly. Thus, I would not hesitate to fly them again nor recommend them.",,,,,
"  Boston to Rome. Horrible service and terrible food. I flew from Boston to Rome in Economy Class, there was a steward extremely rude and unfriendly. You can't even ask a glass of wine or coffee. Lame service, extremely slow. They also lost my bag that I've got 3 days later with the broken lock. At the Rome airport the staff was so unprofessional. It took them 50 minutes to check in my bag, unbelievable. The most horrible experience ever.",,,,,
"  Rome to São Paulo. My seat was 22L. The flight attendants in that part of the airplane were unkind and far from nice. After dinner we were served coffee and tea, and none of the flight attendants passed by that area to collect used cups and napkins. We had to put the dirty cups inside the pouches of the seats in front of us because the flight attendants working in that section had to go to their rest period. They believed they were doing the passengers a huge favor in serving us dinner and, before landing, breakfast. Unfortunately, that's typical of Alitalia economy class in-flight service.",,,,,
"  I flew with Alitalia from Milan Linate to New York via Rome Fiumicino; the experience was not bad. The flight from Linate to Rome was a normal national flight (nothing to say) and landed on time. The flight to NY was on time too, the crew was friendly, the food ok and the airbus clean. The flight back to Rome landed 1 hour early and, as usual, food, crew and aircraft ok! To cut a long story short, good experience with Alitalia.",,,,,
"  At Milan Linate they always put you on a bus to the aircraft which therefore defeats any priority boarding advantage since everybody is lumped together. Once the doors of the bus open it is survival of the fittest with a stampede of people to the stairs of the aircraft to see who can get on-board first. Once onboard, the stewardess insisted I put my carry-on on a different overhead locker since the one directly above my seat was partly in business class which was only had 2/3 of the seats occupied (middle seat deliberately not used) - never encountered such an issue before in 20 plus years of flying. Other people also having to deal with the ""difficult"" stewardess resulting in further delays to a flight that already had been delayed by 30 mins. This resulted in the captain actually coming out to speak to the Alitalia staff to tell them to hurry up with completing the boarding. Once seated, very little legroom. ""Free"" small selection of drinks and snacks - no opportunity to buy any food or drinks. Overall a pretty miserable experience.",,,,,
" São Paulo to Rome. Horrible experience regarding service. The airplane may not be new, but considering it's Economy Class, the seats are spacious if compared to newer airplanes. But what was really terrifying about this flight was the horrible, appalling service given by the flight attendants in the section of the airplane where I was seated (22L). Those staff simply hate their jobs and make it clear that they hate having to serve other people. Disgracefully, these 'other people' are the clients who paid for a seat on their airplanes, hoping to receive some decent service, which doesn't happen. These crew members are the most unkind, unattentive and rudest professionals of all crews in European airlines. Due to my job I have to fly Alitalia frequently and it's always a very unpleasant experience. If you can, avoid Alitalia whenever possible!",,,,,
"  New York to Rome. Really disappointing flying with Alitalia! I am Italian and even if I am leaving in Germany, together with my family we have decided to fly Alitalia to support our own airline. Wrong decision. The service was not good, for example the hostess came only once to offer some water (during dinner time) and nothing more afterwards. When you asked for something (e.g. additional drink), it was like asking for a huge favor, and I was in Premium Economy! The plane was not clean, I had a broken biscuit under my seat. The crew was not friendly, no smile, no “arrivederci” when we were leaving the plane. I am sure that my experience is not the exception as I was flying from Rome to Los Angeles and same things happened. Lowest service I have never had.",,,,,
  Rome to London. Paid for extra luggage on the way out. When we arrived at the airport to return we were told that we had only paid for luggage one way. The email receipt is very misleading suggesting we had paid for the extra space there and back. This stopped us from paying in advance and cost us an extra 20 Euros. I can’t help but feel the information on the receipt is deliberately misleading so people end up having to pay more at the airport than they otherwise would have needed to. Avoid.,,,,,
"  Round trip Milano Linate - Bruxelles operated with Embraer 90 (small aircraft but very good legroom) and with Airbus 319 (comfortable with good legroom) bought for 110 Euro. Both flight were on time, the aircraft very clean and the crew friendly; a soft drink and snack has been offered. I especially enjoyed the peaceful during all flight. Nothing to compare with low cost company!",,,,,
"  Rome to Paris. While waiting at the gate, an employee of Alitalia placed a tag on my wife's carryon bag and said that we would have to check our carry-ons ""because the flight was full."" He did not question whether our carry-ons conform to size and weight regulations, which they did. My wife and I objected explaining that since we had to make a connecting flight, there would not be time to wait for our bags to be unloaded. The agent then was confrontational and stated ""we have to check them in."" He then made a misleading statements: ""The baggage claim in Paris is very near the gate and you will not have to wait for your bags;"" ""Your connecting flight is just next door to Alitalia. You will have plenty of time."" In fact our US flight was from Terminal 1 and we landed in Terminal 2, a good 15 minutes away. When on board we were immediately notified of a 50 minute delay of our departure. The result of this fiasco: Because we had to wait another 40 minutes to claim our luggage that the agent had checked against our stated wishes, we missed our flight. ",,,,,
 Fantastic crew provided quality customer service with smiles! I've flown multiple times in the last year on this airline. Highly recommend. Plane is always clean. Thanks for providing excellent service. Wish you weren't seasonal as I'd fly more with your airline.,,,,,
  Zero customer service. I was only told “no” about 10 times on the phone. Lady seemed to hate her job. Within 7 days you can’t pay for the difference in a flight. You have to pay full price for an additional flight.  Will never book with them again. Spirit is a better airline and that’s sad.,,,,,
"  Expect zero customer service or customer relations when you fly Allegiant. On July 1 my wife and I flew from Tampa to Portsmouth. The woman in the row with us took her dog out of its bag. The stewardess told her two times that pets must stay in their bag at all times but did nothing to make sure she complied. The dog had diarrhea all over the place, ruined my wife's running shoes and bag. Unbelievable, right? The woman apologized but set the soiled dog carrier on my wife's lap while she worked to clean up the mess. It reeked! The stewardess came over and spritzed some air freshener but did nothing to help us. When I contacted customer support requesting reimbursement or a voucher, an agent told us there would be no reimbursement or vouchers saying Allegiant ""has no control over the behavior of passengers."" I am totally shocked. Otherwise, Allegiant has always got us where we are going at the best price with no frills.",,,,,
" Disaster. Third time wasn’t a charm. Got delayed in TSA mess and no attendants at the gate. Was there 18 minutes prior to the flight departure. Staff came out from the locked door and said they had a jam up in the jetway, couldn’t get in as they closed the door behind them. Watched the plane pull away for 18 minutes. I’ve had three flights cancelled… now sitting on hold for 30 minutes so far just to get a flight credit worth nothing. Avoid these people - not worth any amount of “savings”.",,,,,
  It was hell from the moment we entered the airport in Cincinnati. They had zero organization and when we finally got to our gate there was no one at the gate. There was no announcements and no gate agent with our take off time came and passed. Our flight crew arrived and they told everyone we’re just waiting on the gate agent. Where is this gate agent? No answers no information nothing. Don’t ever fly with Allegiant,,,,,
" After delaying our flight MULTIPLE times, when we finally got close to leaving they announced the flight has been cancelled due to no plane there to take us (for our scheduled flight). We lost $1,300+ for our hotel that they were not willing to give any compensation for due to them canceling our flight after we had been there for hours. Will never use Allegiant again. It will be worth the money to fly with a larger airline to ensure we are taken care of.",,,,,
"  Our flight was scheduled to leave at 6pm on June 30th. The gate was very full of excited people who were supposed to be flying to Fort Lauderdale. My husband checks his phone and sees the flight is delayed in the Allegiant app. I checked Flight Aware and Google which both said on time. I went to the desk at the gate and no one was there. I asked other passengers what was going on, they said they didn’t know either but someone who works for Allegiant was at the desk just long enough to tell them, “I don’t know what’s going on. Just sit still.” So they did. I checked the Departures board, said on time. 15 minutes later, everyone’s phones go off. Allegiant sent a TEXT to all passengers about the delay. Not one human interaction! We go get dinner. We are waiting in the USO for our now 8.18pm flight. I’m checking my phone every five minutes since not one person could tell us anything. 35 minutes before we should board, we get another TEXT. This time, it’s cancelled! I furiously went to the gate desk. Once again, not one human is there to tell us what’s going on. Just a lot of angry passengers. I ask any employee I can find, where can I get help? Every single person I asked said to Google it and call Allegiant. I tried but “due to the cancellation of your flight, we are experiencing high call volumes.” Couldn’t get through. Now we are panicking about where our luggage is. Once again not one person could tell us where it was. Finally, after my daughter and I ran to the baggage claim, I found a gentlemen who worked for the airport that pointed us in the right direction. My husband went to the Allegiant desk where you check in. They told him they didn’t know anything about the flight either but that everyone would get vouchers and $150. What about the money we spent on the vacation we were going to? All communication was via text! Shame on you Allegiant! My family has loved flying with this airline. This is exactly how you lose loyal customers.",,,,,
"  Had two great flights and great experience from start to finish. Agent in Asheville on 6/19 was very friendly. No-frills flight was as expected, a no-frills flight from point A to point B. Return trip 6/26 was the same. Apparently, unbeknownst to me, there was a seating issue. Manuel and Jaelynne at Punta Gorda fixed without issue. They were friendly, kind, helpful and very respectful. Not sure why so many negative reviews online. I had no issue whatsoever.",,,,,
"  Worst airline ever. I flew with them a few times and every time they were delayed, and  I wouldn’t not recommend this airline. Bathroom are so dirty.",,,,,
 I have been so ripped off in my life. $90 for one bag going out and another $50 on the return. $40 dollars for boarding passes. I ever consider this airline again even if I have pay more up front.,,,,,
"  
4 hour late in Las Vegas. I spent 12 hours waiting my second flight. Nobody had answers. First time I get a flight with this airline and last too. Terrible.",,,,,
" This was my return trip and I was charged $50 at the gate for my “additional carry on bag”. I had a shoulder bag and a purse, both of which fit comfortably below the seat in front of me. I had both of these same bags on by first trip and was not charged. Ridiculous. They seemed to be very interested in getting everyone boarded early and as quickly as possible on both legs of the trip. The first leg we were able to leave early just to sit on the runway for an extra 30 minutes because there was no gate available. This trip we were rushed to board just so the gate staff and the flight attendants could chat while the pilots still got ready to depart. All the while we were stuck in our very uncomfortable seats without the ability to recline and practically on top of each other. Even the tray tables were more of a phone holder than a table, they were so small. You have to purchase even water, and there is no Wi-Fi or anything similar available. I can’t stand Southwest Airlines, but Allegiant makes Southwest look like a luxury airline. Taking Allegiant saves me 3 hours of driving to and from the airport and I will drive to a farther airport from now on and pay higher fares to avoid them.",,,,,
"  I write reviews a lot online, and 95% of the time, I only write reviews for positive interactions. I feel that negative reviews are generally screwed by emotion, frustration, or anger. And that we have enough negativity in our world. So I try to keep things positive. In this case, I think it’s necessary to document the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced - which came from Allegiant phone customer service. I have never been treated so poorly by an employee of a company that I’ve spent hundreds of dollars patronizing (or any company, for that matter). There was a mix-up when my family flew in for a visit. Their return flight was canceled after they missed an outbound flight, and when we realized this (the night before their return flight), I called to understand the situation. Originally, the gate agent told them their return flight would not be canceled but that they could keep it. So we were surprised when we couldn’t find the reservation for them to check-in. The person who I talked to on the phone to try to fix the problem was unbelievably rude. After discussing the situation, she didn’t believe my family because the agent didn’t make notes, and her attitude toward me was unlike any experience I’ve ever had with a customer service person. I intentionally did my best to stay calm, not raise my voice or have a frustrated or angry tone and asked to speak with her supervisor after she yelled at me. After continuing to be berated by the employee, I calmly continued to ask to talk with her supervisor. She denied me the opportunity several times (she said the supervisor couldn’t help) and eventually *hung up the phone on me!* I understand and can appreciate how hard customer service jobs must be. So again, I did everything possible not to talk down to this person or raise my voice. And I was hung up on. I don’t understand how this airline could possibly prioritize basic respect for one another if this was how their employee acted. I assume they are not teaching patience or customer care (human care) in any fashion. Honestly, nobody should be treated with the disrespect this person showed. The way I was treated was not worth saving a little money to fly cheaply. I could not get this person's name or employee information and am not sure how to follow up on such an extreme situation, so I’m writing a review online in hopes of steering others away from such a challenging circumstance and genuinely negative interaction with another human being. Our world has enough trouble and challenges these days; there should be no reason to experience interactions like this one, especially in a professional setting. So disappointing and astounding that this happened.",,,,,
"  Our flight was delayed by 4 hours last minute. No compensation, customer service said they had no idea why the flight was delayed. Then, the departing flight from Vegas was Delayed an hour, and once we did board (an hour after that) We are all told that the air conditioning on the plane is broken. They're very quick to apologize for the inconveniences. First time flying Allegiant Air. Probably my last.",,,,,
" I had a flight from Norfolk to Ft Lauderdale and they canceled it at the last minute supposedly due to bad weather in Florida, checking the weather map there is nothing true. It was the excuse of canceling the flight so as not to compensate, since I am afraid that I will have to buy a more expensive ticket because it is at the last minute.",,,,,
 I will never book with Allegiant again. They kept me on hold for over 15 minutes on the telephone and via chat. I was told 2 different things by 2 different agents about a credit voucher after requesting to cancel a flight 7 days in advance due to my son’s medical emergency! I was only given a $108 credit for a $448 purchase. They nickel and dime you to death but are not flexible. The WORST airline with the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!,,,,,
  Check in staff is horrible. They talk to you with disrespect and a bad attitude. It's like we are bothering them. Tried to add a bag online for 35 bucks but could not so i ended up paying 50 at the counter. Staff is always saying bad words regardless of young kids. They are disrespectful to military personnel. 1st and last time flying this airline. Not to mention the delays. ,,,,,
"  Flight was originally scheduled May 12 from FNT to LAS. We received an update flight was being delayed reason given was that there was air traffic controller issue at LAS. FAA site confirmed that a runway had to be closed etc. The problem here is a few mins after the announcement I saw the pilot walk off the plane with all his belongings. But the gate agents continued to update as flight is delayed. Hours later the airline gave an update calling it an extended delay and the flight will not leave until May 13. I thought it was odd that the pilot who left never returned. Because the pilot got tired of waiting he decided not to fly at all. The crew from May 13 advised us of that. So we missed a vacation day, lost money on non-refundable tours, etc… all be use Allegiant pilot through a childish temper tantrum for a 3 hour delay. We could have flown and made it to the destination on May 12. Allegiant found a loop hole pertaining to cancellation of flight by calling it an extended delay vs. cancellation. So by doing so they avoid providing refunds for the trip. Not sure about anyone else, but if a scheduled flight does not leave the day it’s supposed to then that is a cancellation in my book. Allegiant ruined a part of my vacation and we only got a voucher that did not even come close at recovering the money we lost because of a single pilot was tired of waiting. I’m astonished that an airline who operates this way is still even around. . This is a low cost airline, and I know that you get what you pay for but there are limits to that even. On a good note airline had to call in a crew to fly us to LAS on their normal day off. That was about the only nice thing that came of this.",,,,,
" I would rather walk than take another Allegiant flight. My flight out was delayed 4 hours. We ended up spending more time sitting on the runway than actually traveling. I was running late for my returning flight (my fault) and I spoke to every employee I could find to help me make my flight. They said you’re going to have to run and maybe you’ll make it. So I was one of those people sprinting through the airport up and down stairs through crowds and I make it to the gate and they said we have a delay. Something they could have told me before I pushed my cardiovascular health to its limits. At this point we have a 2 hour delay because of “mechanical issues” with no end in sight. You always hear the cheap airlines are bad: Allegiant might be the worst of them all. If I could, I would rate them -10/10. I booked this flight in the first place in an act of desperation: it was the only option. Next time, I’ll walk.",,,,,
"  Was supposed to fly out 5/12/23. Flight was delayed for 2 hours with no explanation. Then, 3 hours after we were originally supposed to fly out, they cancelled the flight. The reason for the cancellation was there was not a flight crew scheduled to fly the plane. Not sure how it’s possible to book tickets for a flight when they can’t even provide the crew. Horrible experience and horrible communication from all Allegiant members.",,,,,
  We were supposed to board 5/12/23 at 1:15 pm and then they gave us an announcement that our flight got delayed and they didn’t know for how long the FDA delayed the flight due to high traffic. So you’re telling me every time there is a holiday you are going to delay/ cancel a flight because of high traffic? Ridiculous. Not to mention last time I flew with them I was stranded at the airport for 4 hours because they were fixing the brakes of the airplane and I didn’t get to my destination till 1 am. This will be my last time flying with Allegiant Air.,,,,,
  My seat and aside of my seat had crushed potato chips all over it. I asked the Airline Stewardess if she could quickly clean it with a small vacuum cleaner. She said airlines don't have any. Alison didn't let that stop her. With a smile on her face and determination in her heart she cleaned it without holding up anyone boarding. Thank you Alison for your professional service and your sweet personality! You deserve a raise.,,,,,
"  My flight was due to take off at 6.10, 05/05! The flight was delayed 2 times before they rescheduled while we are in the airport with 2 kids after 7pm due to maintenance which is understandable! Now when you reach out to get help rescheduled through customer service due to their inconvenience the representatives are so rude like you inconvenienced them or something! This was my sons 16th birthday trip and it has been nothing but a hassle! The didn’t want to help with the rental car I also booked through them to pick up on the 5th I asked for a supervisor wasn’t given one the smart mouth lady came back and said she issued a credit for my first day of the rental car which I haven’t seen!",,,,,
" I had an extremely frustrating experience with Allegiant's customer service when my bag was lost during a recent flight. It took weeks of back and forth in emails before the bag was finally shipped to my final destination. Throughout this process, I found that Allegiant's customer service team kept tossing the ball to each other, with no one taking responsibility or ownership of the issue. Despite my repeated attempts to get a resolution, there was no customer service whatsoever. No one was able to take responsibility and fix my issue. To add insult to injury, the file was closed on their system without issuing the refund I was promised. It was a complete nightmare, and I am extremely disappointed in the way Allegiant handled my case. Overall, I would strongly caution against using Allegiant for travel. Their lack of customer service and failure to issue refunds when necessary make them an unreliable and unprofessional choice. Save yourself the trouble and choose a different airline.",,,,,
"  Worst airline I have even attempted to deal with. They broke my luggage on the way to Vegas. This can happen so no big deal however their count was vacant so I could not report it. We ended up mangling to carry and drag it to the parking lot. When returning for the flight back home, the counter agent was unable to help us with the issue and give us a number to call for support. I have called the number over 50 time with zero answer. Their online concierge is a joke and also can not support in any way. I have send several unanswered emails. This airline is a joke, they have zero customer service!",,,,,
"  I booked a flight last year and had to cancel and they gave me a ""voucher"" which I was given a year to use. I just went in to book a flight to use my voucher but cannot do so through the portal. I am writing this review as I wait to talk to customer service and have been on hold for over an hour. What a disgrace and I hope the 400 bucks was worth it as I will never fly your airline again.",,,,,
"  
I fly frequently and experienced the worst customer service ever with Allegiant. I had to go to the agent at the desk to get my boarding pass printed because my ID was not scanning with TSA. When I asked the agent at the desk to print my boarding pass she demanded that I pay for another bag. All I had was my small personal item and a paper bag with food in it ended up leaving my bag with my dinner in it because I didn’t want to pay the $50 charge for another bag. So ridiculous. It says right in the rules that you are allowed to bring food in addition to the personal item. Clearly an untrained and extremely rude employee. I submitted a complaint to Allegiant and got nowhere. Just a vague apology. I had requested to be reimbursed for the food that I had to inappropriately throw away. Just some reply about how they couldn’t possibly do anything else at this point. Zero effort to take responsibility for their untrained rude and inappropriate employee.",,,,,
"  Totally trash. They delayed for 2 hours first and then additional 3 hours. And it was only for 2 hours flight to Sarasota. They told that ""there is heavy air traffic at Sarasota"" but when I checked over Flight Radar there wasn't a huge amount of traffic. They are lying to customers.",,,,,
"  The worst airline ever. Do not fly this airline unless you don't care if you make it to your destination. They canceled my flight today for no reason and no explanation given. They had no other alternative flights. This is the second time this has happened to me. They, by far, are the most unreliable airline. Service is poor and they run a cattle car system. Not worth the time or effort to trust this airlines with you travel needs. ",,,,,
  Canceled my outbound flight. Delayed over 5 hours on return. No snack or drink provided. No communication about the delays. Seats suck I have nothing positive to say about this entire travel experience. No one could tell us the time we were delayed too. The crew thought they were leaving and they tried to hold them. No one has any idea what is going on. No TV no nothing.,,,,,
"  I had 3 of my employees on this flight, one just beat cancer and was still weak but she really wanted to come. We were supposed to fly out at 8:50 pm we got to the airport at 6:45 everything was OK tell a hour later when the first two hour delay happened, then from 11pm to 12am, then 1am, then 2, we boarded the plane at 4am sat in the plane another hour before taking off. We missed our car rental had to take a $300 uber straight to Orange County Convention Center so we wouldn't miss the education we were there for, zero sleep, we left the Convention at noon had to find a car to rent from there. I was so upset with the customer service I kept the rented car and drove back to Indiana 20 hours and several extra hotel meals. That delay if they would have told us from the start I could have made other flight plans, but we were told it won't be long now. So many times. When we did get on the plane they didn't give us any beverages and I'm even a Allegiant air card member, I have had 3 flights this year with them and every flight has been delayed.",,,,,
  That canceled my flight for no reason and no explanation given. They had no other alternative flights and we had to buy very expensive flights from other airline. This is the second time this has happened to me.,,,,,
"  On flight home in 4/2023 left stranded 1350 mi from home. In early morning Hrs,- unable to access email, They canceled flight for no apparent reason other than under booked flight! Their only response was to refund my return trip and rebook me for 4 days later at an additional cost if $86 to me! No concern that I had to find hotel & transportation until then, at a cost of no less than $700 to me. They are very unreliable and not worth the risk",,,,,
"  Awful experience, sat in the plane for 2.4 hours as they tried to repair a door that wouldn’t close, then a parking brake that wouldn’t disengage. They deboarded us and after about 45 mins had us board a different plane, and it had a problem with its door too. Another hour in the plane waiting for repairs. And then they wanted to charge us for sodas and chips. Found out our flight is late 60% of the time. Never flying this airline again, I can’t imagine they’ll be around very long anyway.",,,,,
"  Do not use this airline! Cancelation is frequent. Our flight was cancelled while we were at the airport, eaving us stranded for 2 days! My tickets were over $1000. They were gonna reimburse me $800.",,,,,
"  This is the worst airline. They cancelled my flight without notification. ""The pilot was too tired"". While I am pleased the pilot didn't attempt to fly, the airline did not offer any other option. They sent a link for $175 for our inconvenience but the link does not work and in fact, expires! The very next day, the new itinerary, was moved from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm in the evening. Again, no notice and this time it was ""the airport delay"". For the pleasure of flying with Allegiant, I incurred over $1200 in additional travel expenses. Not one professional apology or effort to make the travel better. It doesn't matter that individuals had deadlines and places to be and they could care less. The final straw, we had rebook the flight because the second flight was cancelled. They had the nerve to recharge us! Unbelievable. Trust me, you get what you pay for with this airline. Just pay Delta; get to your destination without worrying about this BS.",,,,,
"  Allegiant Air managed to lose my luggage in nostop flight. There is no luggage counter in Indianapolis, so I went to the 2nd floor to the ticket counter. The Allegiant rep was very rude to me, threatening to call the police if I will not leave without my luggage. ",,,,,
  Highly do not recommend! Our flight delayed twice and then canceled last minute due to “maintenance issues.” They didn’t offer anyone accommodations and only offered a $200 refund. My family and I are now stuck driving 12 hours home tomorrow with my special needs child after finally finding a rental car and being stranded.,,,,,
  At 4 o’clock in the morning we received a cancellation of our flight for a flight that was to leave at 7 AM in the morning. We were offered no other options for other flights. The best they could do was three days later .. now scrambling to try to find a way to get home. We will never ever use them again,,,,,
" Absolutely horrible airline - their staff’s negligence and incompetencies lead to 60+ minutes sitting on the tarmac due to 10,000 POUNDS of over-fuelling; with no air circulation, compensation offerings (on, or off the plane), and the demand for a de-plane with a subsequent 2+ hour delay. Their excessive and inexcusable oversight caused countless missed flights, canceled classes, and over-heated, parched, passengers. The least they could do is offer SOME compensation for their passengers for their mistake(s), but that never came. Disappointed is an understatement, I will never be flying with them again.",,,,,
" Do not take this airline! Canceled our flight 1 hour before we were supposed to depart and their excuse was they ""didn't have enough staff"". Told us there wasn't going to be another one until 10pm on Monday when it was currently Saturday. We had to rent a car and are currently having to drive 16hrs straight home. They didn't even care to cover the cost for all the extra money we had to spend because they were unorganized and irresponsible. Take my advice and spend the extra money on a good airline! I have to give them 1 star to submit but they deserve a big 0!",,,,,
"  A friend of mine and I traveled to Florida for a golf trip in January of 2023. We arrived several hours before our flight boarded. We dropped our bags off at the ticket counter as usual and proceeded to board our flight. When we arrived in Florida we discovered that our bags never made it onto the plane. Allegiant offered to put them on the next plane to Destin, but that was Sunday evening and we were returning Monday and our bags would do us no good at that point. We were told by the agents at the ticket counter in Florida that we could purchase whatever we were missing and we would be reimbursed. We were told that we would be reimbursed for the baggage fee since they never sent our bags. It's been months since I've sent our information to be reimbursed without any response. I've emailed, called, and left messages with nothing in return. ",,,,,
" Clean, courteous. 30 min boarding delay. Fastest direct flight ever! 3hr 19 min. Upgrade for extended leg room in rows 1-7 worth it! Free drink. Very satisfied. No WIFI. Seats don’t recline.",,,,,
"  My flight was delayed and I had to wait in the airport for seven hours. I emailed Allegiant to ask if there was anything they could do to make this situation right, but they told me the case was closed and I wasn't entitled to anything per company policy. I will not be flying this airline again, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",,,,,
" I'll preface this by saying the crew was fantastic. Unfortunately that's the only positive. First, they charge 50 bucks for carry on. I got that free on the flight to Austin with Alaska. Then a gate agent called too many zones at once and it turned into a big mess. On-board it was cramped and the seats are just metal with fabric. My back is feeling it today. And there is no wifi nor even a tiny snack or cup of water available, even water is pay only. Terrible experience. Shouldn't exist as an airline.",,,,,
"  The worst airline ever. Plane was dirty, crumbs on the seats. Stewardess were extremely rude. By the time you pay for the check in bags, the carry on bag, and then tried to charge me for my purse because it was a personal item. Zero form of entertainment, and 400% up charge on snacks and drinks simply makes the cheap tickets worthless.",,,,,
"  Horrible experience, I flew with my wife and 3 children, The flight was set to board at 6:15 and it didn’t. Then once boarded it took about an hour to fly out. When we finally flew out everything was fine until the pilot flew into a storm and did not even warn the passengers or flight attendants who were in the aisle selling beverages with the cart. The Turbulence was horrible and out of nowhere the plane dropped several feet in the air with passengers scared to death and screaming. My children had a horrible scary experience, the pilot finally tells everyone he is in a storm and to buckle up that if he has to descend and land he will but for now buckle up and stay in your seats the flight attendants had to run back to there seats and secure the drink cart. Very horrible trip. I do not recommend this airline to anyone. ",,,,,
" This flight was the worst I have ever experienced in my entire life, my children were scared to death, it was super late to board and fly out. The pilot gave no warning of an upcoming storm and while the flight attendants were out giving drinks the entire plane dropped several feet and the people on the plane screamed in fear. My baby woke up scared to death and my two other children yelled. They continued to fly in the storm instead of go around it and put us all in danger. Do not fly Allegiant.",,,,,
" Allegiant Air is absolutely horrible - they leave people stranded all the time - twice now they have cancelled my flight from West Palm Beach to Minneapolis in the month of March, 2023! They are the most unreliable airline that I have ever flown - do not trust them at all - they will cancel your flight less than two hours before you are to leave and for no reason at all - they never respond to emails, phone calls (after being on hold for 4 hours), or Facebook Messenger! They need help - some other airline needs to buy them now!",,,,,
"  Cheap Rude Airline. When they cancel for maintenance or weather. ""They do strand you."" They will not help you get home. They might give you a voucher to fly again for a portion. (If you can get a hold of them). Cost me $800 for 2 people to get home when they canceled the flight for maintenance. Originally cost $200ish round trip. One year prior, they did the same to us. Cost us an extra $400 then. Different airport. Will never fly again. Was offered $10.00 refund for our flight home this time. Ask to talk to a supervisor, and they will say no, take it leave, or they will hang up the call was their response.",,,,,
"  We've been using Allegiant Air for a while now. We recently booked two flights and it automatically upgraded us to some weird bundle, which resulted in almost a $200 up charge. Naturally, we cancelled and rebooked. The only problem was that we used some of our points to book the first time. Not only did we not get our points back, they shorted us $15 on the refund. We waited for hours on the phone to talk with someone. Never even got through. Very annoying.",,,,,
"  Don't fly with this airline unless you want to be 1-3 hours late. The flight to and from were both delayed 1-2 hours. The flight arrivals were 1 hour late and you spend another hour sitting in the plane waiting for it to start moving. Minimal space for seating, smallest tray tables I've seen on any flight, and they will charge you for beverages or food/snacks. They offer no in flight entertainment. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money for a much better airline.",,,,,
  I absolutely hate Allegiant. Our flight has been delayed traveling both ways. I have been delayed for hours now and still no notification (email or text) that the flight was delayed. The absolute worst experience I have ever had flying.,,,,,
  I was recently on an Allegiant flight from Asheville NC to Minneapolis MN (Flight 237). I was feeling nauseous after 45 minutes into the flight so I got up to use the restroom in the rear of the plane. Once I got to the back i became extremely dizzy and I blacked out. I could hear people talking to me but I couldn’t see anything. The Allegiant flight attendants acted fast to put an oxygen mask on me and laid me down on the floor. I believe two nurses were on my flight too who checked my pulse and blood pressure. I wish I knew their names so I could thank them for jumping up to make sure I was ok. Very scary moment for me but everyone who helped me made sure I was comfortable as I came back to and I’ll forever be grateful for them.,,,,,
" Allegiant is the absolute worst airline. My boarding pass said to to board at 7.20 am and to be there 2 hours prior. Showed up on time, waited for over an hour and no Allegiant employee ever showed up to check myself and my bags in. This is unacceptable! This was supposed to be a surprise birthday trip for my elderly grandmother and this companies lack of compassion for its clientele has ruined it! This is a weekend I will never get back!",,,,,
" Been on vacation to Punta Cana. Get to the airport and check in at 10:30 am for a 1:00 pm flight home. Sat on the plane for 2 hours while they explain to us that they're having computer issues. After 2 hours they make us all disembark from the plane and haven't given us a status, just keep pushing the time out. First time ever flying with this airline, will be the last. I'd be willing to fly the Three Stooges airline if there eas such a thing, before ever flying Allegiant again.",,,,,
"  I am pretty sure that the Allegiant Air executives do not care to read or to pay attention to the reviews of their airline - for them, the revenue and the profit is the most important. Not the passengers. Not the service. I was scheduled to fly from Harrisburg, PA, to Ft. Lauderdale, FL on March 2nd - Allegiant flight #507 leaving at 6:26pm. Without any notifications or warnings, the flight has been re-scheduled 8 times for the departure at 10:45pm (more than 4 hrs delay). At the same time, there was NO ONE from the airline at the gate to convey/explain the delay or to communicate any related information. I've tried to chat with the customer service via the website but to no avail (""sorry, our agents are not currently available""), tried calling the customer service - waited for 1.5 hrs to no avail either. Overall, it is an ultra low cost airline (although I paid a pretty hefty price for a one way ticket - the same as on United Airlines in opposite direction) with a non-existent customer service and the lack of responsibilities. If you are enjoying spending long-long hours being delayed and arriving in the middle of night (2-3am instead of 9pm), having ""zero"" customer service - yes, choose Allegiant Air!",,,,,
"  Flight 1911 originating in Bangor Maine. Scheduled to take off at approximately 3:40pm on 2/28/23. 90 Min delay right off the bat. Then another delay and another delay. Then boarding takes place and we have to be de iced. Had to get in line for that. waited an hour then went to runway, waited so long there de icing had expired. Back to De icing area, sat and waited. Never happened. Then Flt attendant said airport closing for an hour. Back to the gate, deplaned. After a while boarded again. Went to de ice. Never happened. Say for 30 or 40 min. Back to the gate. Flight attendant says they ran out of de icer. Please keep in mind this is Bangor Maine in mid winter. Flight is finally delayed until 3/1 at 1 pm. 3/1 1pm no plane2:30 still no plane. in the meantime, their flight scheduled for 31 are taking off. Customer service rep tells us that they are flying a plane in from Pennsylvania to finally take us to our destination over 24 hours late. I've spent the better part of two days now at the Bangor airport and I'm not spending any more and so I asked for my bags back, and I rebook with a flight to Tampa on Thursday evening. And I drag all my bags back to the car and leave just spend another night in the motel and then I think better of what I've done and so I cancel everything, including the booking that I made for the end of March, I'm through with Allegiant. The customer service people were very nice and unfortunately they are trapped with the angry customer so they have the worst job of anyone. In fact, I just acquired and allegiant air credit card because I was using the airline so much and I will be cutting that up in the very short pieces and sending it to someone with instructions on what they could possibly do with it. ",,,,,
  I was set to fly and when I got to the airport my service dog was denied. I asked why and the attendant had no idea. I lost the flight. I have trying to get in touch and that is a laugh. They do not return emails or answer the phone. I have sat on the phone for hours and no attendant. I have lost the $500 and I have tried to reach out to them and they just ignore you. I would not fly them again.,,,,,
" I will never fly Allegiant again. Was an awful flight there and back. First flight had 3 drunk guys sitting behind us at 9am. Many complaints but flight crew didn't do anything about it. They would rather save 3 than the many who sat around them behind bothered by the yelling and bad language. The flight back was even worse. The people directly behind us had a medium size dog that whined and yelped loudly the entire 2.5 hour trip. The dog was under my seat so it was even louder for me. The owners only were addressed by the crew when they were caught with the dog sitting openly on their lap. Not being bad enough, the dog was also passing gas. One of the requirements listed on Allegiants website is the animal must be ""non disruptive"". This definitely was not the case and the flight crew was not eager to do anything about it. Not to mention that both of us are allergic and were sneezing. I did reach out to Allegiant with my complaint. Their answer was shocking and dismissive to say the least. They pretty much said, in short, that it's my problem and they did nothing wrong. I asked to speak to someone else and I've been brushed off. Again, they are going to lose passengers to save the feelings of two people. This isn't very good business!",,,,,
" By far the worst airline and service. We flew to Plattsburgh from Florida and back to Florida- without landing. Apparently, conditions were too icy to land in NY so the entire plane was flown back to its Florida destination. We had been on the plane since 7 am and during the now 7 hour flight we were offered complimentary pretzels and water. Everyone’s trip was ruined, we were exhausted, and hungry sitting in seats with no cushion, and that’s the best they could do. Also - did no one check conditions before that plane took off? And why could it not have rerouted to Allegiant Albany terminal which was fully operational? Poor planning, horrible customer service, and the most god awful experience I’ve ever had. You’d be better off walking.",,,,,
"  On my return flight from Puerta Gorda to Nashville, their baggage handling destroyed my Samsonite, indestructible up to their handling, Hardcastle golf case on the return trip to Nashville. Instead of having a complaint Baggage claim desk near Baggage claim, I was forced to drag my damaged golf case as well as my other luggage back upstairs too the ticketing, Check-In desk to file a claim. The attendant, while being one of the most pleasant people was unable to file a claim. They took my information and was told, we will contact you. For those who purchase Samsonite products, you have to believe they purposely destroyed my property. That case, over the last two years has been in 3 different continents. Only Allegiant managed to damage my property. I have no doubt that they will not contact me nor provide, at the very least, repair my golf case. This was my first and last trip with them. They are cheap in every meaning of the word. Next time I will pay more to land farther away from my destination, rent a vehicle and arrive happier.",,,,,
" We had a morning flight that they screwed up sending the check in email. We went to check in at the desk and they wouldn't do it because it was “too close to boarding time”. Funny thing is, boarding hadn't even started and the flight wasn't scheduled to leave for 43 more minutes. Keep in mind this is a tiny airport, and going through security and getting to the gate takes 10 minutes or less. But anyway, they wouldn't do it and so we had to reschedule for a later flight. We came back a few hours later and and waited at the gate only to be told that our flight was canceled because they needed to do maintenance on the plane. The next flight wouldn't depart for another 7 hours. In short, Allegiant doesn't care about their customers time or inconvenience, and they definitely don't care about good communication.",,,,,
"  We were ticketed for the early morning flight from Provo to Mesa. Rcvd and email saying time to check in so the night before we did our check-in. Silky smooth using the Allegiant app. All good, flight says on time, this is about midnight for an 8:15am departure. We show up at the airport to do the bag drop but there is no bag drop line. Just one line for ticketing, checkin and bags. We wait in line and after about 20 mins an agent calls out anyone on the Mesa flight has to see her. Turns out the flight the night before was 8 hours late so our flight was getting bumped 12 hours. Didn't we get the email? (no email, no text, no alert on the app.) None of the other passengers we talked with had any notice either. Agent offered to book us on their noon flight but that flight is full. The event we were traveling for was for tonight so our plans were blown up totally. We offered to drive to SLC to get a flight on another airline but they were unwilling to book us. Told we should be getting a $100 voucher and our tickets would be refunded in a week or so. And if we don't get refunded come on back in and they will work on it. Last minute pricing and flight available prevented us from rebooking ourselves so home we go. Love flying out of the smaller regional airports but will never fly Allegiant again.",,,,,
"  My husband and I were seated towards the back of the plane. Row 25 to be exact. It was a full flight. No issues there. However, during take off one of the other passengers managed to leave an open alcoholic beverage in the overhead carry on area. This alcoholic beverage found its way 2 seats back to pour onto my husband and I. I do mean poured on us!! Overhead luggage was soaked in what smelled to be whiskey and so were our clothes. Let me also add that my husband is 11 days out of Alcohol rehab! So needless to say this caused even more issues to the 3 screaming babies on board and the 4 very intoxicated passengers surrounding us. Those are things we could have handled and expected, but to be doused by alcohol during take off and to return home with our luggage soaked in it was infuriating. To add insult to injury, when we brought it to the flight attendants attention, she was attentive to drying out the over head bins with paper towels but never offered to hand us something to dry off with. I am beyond infuriated with our experience with this airline!",,,,,
"  They absolutely refused to check the dimensions of my wife's bag, but insisted that it was too big. We measured it beforehand to assure it was the proper size. They tried to strong arm us into paying $100 for the bag. We even re-arranged items between our group to fit their request, but the worker still refused to check the bag. Needless to say we were denied access to the flight, and were told there was no refund. ",,,,,
"  The flight was on time and most things were perfect.  Unfortunately there was a gate agent who ruined the whole trip.  I was traveling with my wife and we both had small carryon bags, about half the size of a 20"" piece of luggage.  My wife had a very small over the shoulder bag, about a tenth the size of most purses.  I decided to help my wife with her bag and carry it for her when we moved up to scan our tickets.  The gate agent forced us to get back off the jetway and jam the tiny bag into one of other bags.  I'm pretty sure when I was checking things out that 2 bags were allowed per person so either he was stupid and couldn't figure out that each of the larger bags belonged to 1 person, or he just decided to be a jerk.  My money is on the latter.  We had been polite and compliant up until that point.  We did what he asked but made sure he knew we weren't happy about it.  There was a long line of people behind us as well and I don't know they could have interpreted the gate agent's actions any other way than being a jerk.  Once back on the jetway, I was not quiet about my displeasure either.  ",,,,,
"  My daughter flew from Phoenix to Idaho Falls flight 636, Jan 3rd. Here is the sequence of comical, unbelievable errors by Allegiant, but most disturbing was the nonchalant attitude with no communication and mitigation to the errors. -Flight was late (not usually that big of a deal). After arriving, she waited over two hours for a ""paid"" check baggage, with no communication at all on eta or reason from Allegiant staff. She had been picked up by a mother with a baby, so they had to call it a night after 2.5 hrs.  A passenger wandered out to the Tarmac to see if he could get info about what was going on .The passenger came back and reported that there may have been an accident with the ground crew, that Allegiant was short staffed, and they had no ETA. At no time did Allegiant send a message to my daughter through Text or the App (even though you have her information, and knew she checked a bag - With no information, and with no-one at Allegiant Airport picking up the phone or calling us back (we left messages) the communication was completely irresponsible and non-sympathetic to the passenger schedules (like college classes). I called twice myself and no one returned calls. She went back, paid for transportation there on the next day, Jan 4th, but no one from Allegiant was there (couldn't you pay for 1 staff to be there to hand out luggage?)  She found airport staff who said they couldn't help, but to come back on Friday the 5th at 9am or 2pm when Allegiant had a flight and therefore staff. Turns out there was no flight in the afternoon, but we were lucky and we stumbled onto that fact, no thanks to Allegiant, so she went in the morning. Why couldn't Allegiant take action to at least communicate? To deliver the baggage would have been even more helpful, even it was for a fee. Why not use the system which knows she checked a bag? Why didn't someone the night of the Arrival come tell the passengers ""we had an accident, we are short staffed, Allegiant doesn't offer services (or care) so come back when we have a flight so that you can stand in line and have an agent help you get your luggage that we will hang on to for 2 days and have you at our convenience come get it, taking a chance on when you arrive because we don't communicate because walking to the waiting customers or sending an email or text is too expensive. Please let me know what happened, and why.  I tried contacting Allegiant but they won't answer via phone nor email.",,,,,
"  I had an extremely frustrating experience with Allegiant's customer service and refund process. After I could not check my bag 45 minutes before my flight, thus not being able to board, I spent hours on the phone trying to reach a representative to assist me with an insurance refund. When I finally got through, the customer service agent was unhelpful and dismissive, offering little to no assistance. Furthermore, when I requested a refund, I was told I needed to cancel my flight an hour before takeoff. If I knew I could not check my bag 45 minutes before the flight, I would have done so. Overall, the customer service and refund process provided by Allegiant was utterly unsatisfactory, and I will not be choosing to fly with you in the future.",,,,,
"  Allegiant ended up cancelling the flight for my son and his girlfriend to fly back to school due to weather. Allegiant customer service informed them that they will not be rescheduling the flight and they would have to travel to Vegas or Arizona to get a flight instead. Now we all understand that weather can cause these issues but after taking with customer service they informed them that they will not help with a rental or flying my son to either Vegas or Arizona. I spoke to a manager after learning what they told my son and she came on the phone really aggressive and just straight told me that Allegiant will not do anything to help them and they will refund our money. But at this time the cost to get a new ticket is 3 times as much as what they are going to refund us. When I informed her of all extra costs, extra stay, and now a rental car to drive to Arizona, she told me that that is all on us and Allegiant will not help with anything. Then I asked her if she would be ok if her kids were stranded somewhere and their airlines wouldn’t help them. She then got really hostile and and tried to hang up. We have flown them a few times but I can assure you that me nor anyone in my family will fly them again. We have 3 kids in college that play sports and we fly a lot. Allegiant will never be getting our business again. I can’t believe the way their customer service was and they were not willing to help at all after leaving a plane full of passengers stranded in California with their only option to book a new flight out of Vegas or Arizona all in their own dime.",,,,,
" The Allegiant employees at the check-in counter at Dulles held me up by forcing me to check my carry-on suitcase. It's the same standard sized suitcase made for overhead bins that I've taken with me on many flights without any prior issues. However it was slightly too thick to fit all the way into a suspiciously skinny test bracket they have fixed to the ground beside the counter, so they forced me to pay extra and check it in. This hassle also delayed me from getting through airport security, but I went along without complaining. After I arrived at the gate, I discovered that the plane had left the terminal about 10 minutes earlier than its scheduled time! Two other passengers missed the flight as well. I called the airline and asked for a refund of the return portion of my itinerary and they refused! And that was after I had been assured by an Allegiant employee at the gate counter that a partial refund would be issued. I will never fly with this airline again! They lie to and rip off customers!",,,,,
"  When I booked my flight I was given the option to add a hotel which I did however when I went to check in at the hotel there was no confirmation for my stay. Allegiant charged me, sent me confirmation but the hotel did not have the confirmation and basically I was left no hotel and had to rebook directly from the hotel. I called Allegiant the day of and was on hold 3.5 hours since this was the day I flying I could not stay on hold. I have emailed them but have not heard back. Their chat is unavailable.  My flight was fine and I was able to confirm but if you want a package do not book it with them",,,,,
 Absolute horrible experience. Flight delayed 6 hours and no update. They gave me a meal voucher worth $10 and a $4 drink. Thanks for the consideration. What about the $300 for missed Airbnb $60 for car rentals? Appreciate the $14 gesture though.,,,,,
"  Worst airline I have ever flown on, chose them due to being the cheapest tickets available, you pay for what you get, before the flight started there were two delays postponing the flight for hours, after takeoff we were informed we would be circling the circling airport due to weather concerns, after circling for 2 hours we were diverted to another airport in a neighboring state, after being told not to worry and leave our bags on the plane because we would be flying back towards the original destination airport by the pilot, we waited for 3 hours to finally be told to come get our luggage, the flight was canceled, and good luck with the remainder of the trip, but this was told to us by the workers at the airport because the allegiant airline workers and pilots had already left and were nowhere to be seen to help the now stranded passengers. Upon calling Allegiant air's customer service via phone we were told not to worry and that the flight would be refunded due to the cancelation, they then informed us that due to our approval to divert the flight to another airport while the flight was going on they would not be refunding any of the cancelation and each member flying would get a 50 dollar credit, this is the kind of bare bones airline I couldn't recommend to anyone and can't still imagine how they are still in business, stay away at all cost/they stranded my family.",,,,,
 I just want you to know I have flown with Allegiant for many years and in this December we had a ice storm I had to reschedule and cancel 3 times. This customer service is 100% awesome. I would recommend Allegiant Air to everyone. Customer service is number one and they have it. I'd like to thank everyone at Allegiant for being so accommodating to I will fly again. ,,,,,
" I have to say that I am increasingly disappointed in Allegiant Air every time I have an interaction with them. They are cheap, and I will give them that, however on many occasions over the years of flying that I have done with them I realize that they are more trouble than they are worth. They delay the flights often for many hours (this has happened on multiple occasions), charge you for a change in flight date, and charge you if you cancel a flight after 24 hours for a lot of money. Their flight attendants at times are not on time or they are poorly managed. There are many issues that I have personally witnessed and I am unhappy with the service I have received from them.",,,,,
" Absolute garbage of an airline. Not once have I ever been on a flight with Allegiant that has been departed on time. I learned my lesson a long time ago, but this trip was booked by my parents who swear “it’s not that bad”. Imagine my surprise when we get a text notification as we are walking into the airport that we are looking at a 2.5hr delay. Great news with two senior citizens and two kids under the age of 11 and one toddler. After looking at FlightAware I found that this was a rolling delay that had been hours in the making. This notification could have been sent out hours before just like any other airline notifies their customers. So, now we are sitting at a small regional airport for more than two additional hours with small children with an ETA of 1AM. Ideal situation. Upon arrival we were told that our baggage would delivered to carousel 3 but instead it was a delivered to carousel 6 (in another building). This was only after entire A320 worth of passengers with screaming tired children waited for over an hour. Our return trip was no different. We arrived to Sanford to be treated by a departure board showing 22/32 flights delayed. Three gate changes one plane change after boarding, three hours of waiting we board our “new” plane. Just like any terrible infomercial, “but wait there’s more”! After boarding we waited over an hour for them to load the baggage. I don’t know who thought loading everyone onto a plane with 10 children under the age of two BEFORE the baggage was a good idea after more than a two hour delay, but they need to find a new line of work where common sense and consideration are not necessary. Allegiant, you never disappoint at being a disappointment. I guess someone has to be at the bottom.",,,,,
"  Class act from start to finish, very accommodating. The flight was perfect, crew was kind and very helpful. Overall A + service I will keep flying Allegiant.",,,,,
"  Worst flight experience in my life. Both my flights on my round trip was delayed by at least 3 hous, my first departure was delayed by 6 hours. Staff was very unhelpful and unsympathetic to any of the problems that occurred, and seemed irritated when all the fault was on them. They loaded a total of 15 bags on my return flight, and sent the rest to God knows where, and sent the flight off anyway. Instead of fixing or helping the whole rest of the customers they seriously inconvenienced, left typed instructions with a pile of papers saying write down your problems and we will deal with them later. Very unprofessional, do not expect any good experiences with this company if you decide to fly with them.",,,,,
  Horrible communication. Delayed the flight 4 times without an explanation and then cancelled the flight too late on Christmas Eve to book anything else. They have lost a customer forever. We will never fly with them again. We do not recommend.,,,,,
 It was delayed 6 hrs then they canceled the flight for a fuel problem and there were no other flights to Denver with seats. Would not recommend this airline.,,,,,
" I've flown Allegiant multiple times and I'm at my last straw. Horrible customer service and weak flight cancellation excuses are reasons my family will never fly them again. I had a flight cancelled last spring with little notice due to not having enough pilots (they used covid as an excuse but the real reason was there wasn't enough people on the flight). I was forced to rebook thru Delta for $2000 more due to the late timing. Allegiant did nothing to help offset the cost or make it right. Even after waiting on hold to talk to a manager for 2.5 hours. I had another flight scheduled to take off tomorrow 12-24-22 and I received a text this morning saying my flight has been cancelled due to weather. The weather tomorrow is in the 40s and Mesa is in the 60s PLUS the other airlines are still flying. After waiting on hold for 2 hours, there was nothing they could do. I asked to speak to a manager and she said sorry, I would need to call a different number and easier on hold again. Terrible company! Just spend a little more and go with a real airline!",,,,,
  I’m sitting in the airport writing this as it unfolds. They just announced there is too much fuel on the airplane to take off. They are going to remove the fuel and fly to Tulsa and get more fuel but they don’t know if they can find another flight crew to complete the trip to Florida. Just spoke to the pilot who said the previous announcements were false. The pilot said he will fly the leg to Florida but the plane will have to stop for fuel in Tulsa. This is complete mismanagement. Planes have to calculate total weight with fuel and passengers. ,,,,,
"  We had booked with Allegiant a month and half before Christmas and planned to fly home the week of Christmas for a family reunion. I am military and my family hasn’t all been together in over 5 years. Less than 24 hours before our scheduled flight. Allegiant canceled our flight, no explanation. Looking for next day tickets is a fortune and now we are driving 21 hours to make this family reunion a reality. What was suppose to be a convenient and quick trip has turned into 40+ hour road trip and less time with family over Christmas because now I have to leave a day earlier to accommodate driving. My wife and I are beyond upset, the less than 24 hour notice is mind blowing! How can they do this? And with no explanation?",,,,,
"  Seats available but they split the family, leave the kids by themselves. I need to pray to my kids don't spills soda on the next passenger. It's not because the 50 bucks to change 4 seats. The company has no ethics or consideration for the consumer. Do you think that 50 for 4 seats will change the company's results?",,,,,
" They are absolutely awful at all aspects of a flight experience. Rude people. Unapologetic or sympathetic to being almost an hour delayed. Seem to have never flown in a cold weather city or know it’s cold in winter. You get what you pay for. And I’m this case WAY, WAY, less.",,,,,
"  Truly it is not very customer friendly to fly Allegiant. My flight was delayed from 7pm to 12:50pm and there was no sort of refund at all. Also another time they flew above the Provo Utah airport and decided not to land even though they could have (I may add though they were worried about potential ice) and took us straight back to Mesa AZ. They then gave us a flight to Ogden the next day. I believe that there is a much better way to administrate this airline and be more respectful to customers. It is cheap, but it is to the point where it may be more worth it going on American, Delta, or anything else.",,,,,
"  Terrible airline. We found out our flight was delayed 9+hours exactly 1.5 hours before take-off. When we went to contact customer service, we were on the phone for 3+ hours and no one responded. They gave me a voucher for this trip since we wound up having to fly on a different more reliable airline. When I went to use the voucher, it wouldn’t work and I contacted customer service with no response for 2+ weeks. I contacted them again and they told me my voucher had been voided. They would not even hear my side of the story and responded with “this is the last time we will reply in regards to this matter.” I can’t believe this airline treats their customers like this. I’m out 200$ now not including the price of the new flight, food, books, etc we had to buy while waiting at the airport.",,,,,
" The few flights I’ve been on with this airline have been average at best, but this most recent trip was a disaster! Our flight was originally suppose to leave at 4:00 but was delayed due to some reason that was never made clear. After hours of waiting, there was another flight scheduled to leave for this same route at 6:48, but instead of putting us on that plane like they should’ve done since we’d already been waiting for several hours, they let the original passengers take flight, while making us wait for our plane to arrive. Our plane finally arrives and we board the plane around 7:10. After waiting for about an hour to take off, the pilot informs us that the vehicle that was supposed to taxi the plane won’t start and we’ll have to get off the plane until they can “formulate a solution” really? They only have 1 vehicle that can taxi the plane in the whole freaking airport? So that brings us to now, it’s currently about 8:30 and we are all sitting here with no idea what’s going to happen. Allegiants management is terrible, communication is subpar l, and I will drive the 10 hours it takes to get before I fly with this lousy airline again. 0/10 for me.",,,,,
" I was not able to actually take the trip for the ticket I purchased. According Allegiant's website, changes would be easy to make if necessary and only required a $25 fee. I attempted to make changes on Thanksgiving Day and could not reach them by phone, email, or the chat feature on their website. Hold times were in excess of 3 hours. Understanding this is the case during the holidays, I kept trying to reach them until I finally reached someone 4 days later by setting my alarm to wake me up at 4:00 a.m. so that I could call them. At this point, I was outside of the 7-day window, but tried to explain to the representative that I'd been trying to reach someone well before the 7-day advance notice requirement for changes. The key word here is that I ""tried"" to explain. The representative I spoke to was the rudest person I think I've ever reached in a customer service department. She kept cutting me off and reciting what sounded like a script that she was reading off of her computer screen. By the time she was finished listing all of the applicable fees, she said my $200 ticket was really only worth $23. I asked to speak to a supervisor and again attempted to explain the extenuating circumstances under which I needed to make a change, but she continued to rudely cut me off mid-sentence. Finally I was so angry I just hung up the phone. The airline needs to anticipate high call volume around holidays and still provide a means of communication with its customers. I was assured by the website that my email would receive a response within 24 to 48 hours, but now almost 2 weeks later I still haven't heard from anyone. They should also train their phone representatives to have some common courtesy and allow customers to speak and not treat everyone as if they're stupid. Let me also add I actually drove 45 minutes to the airport to speak to a representative in person, but there was not one single Allegiant employee at the airport that I could speak to. Overall, this airline scores minus zero in my book!",,,,,
"  My experience flying with Allegiant is my first and last. The ticket agent who checked our bag for the flight down was incredibly rude and tried to bully us into paying 50 for my carry on saying it wouldn’t fit under the seat and threatened it would be 80 at the gate. My bag was smaller than many on the plane. Ended up being fine but she added a lot of stress and irritation to the flight down. Also their bag weight is 10 lbs less than almost every other airline in an effort to squeeze more money out of the passengers who are already flying this airline due to limited funds. On the flight home over thanksgiving weekend we arrived 3 hrs before boarding to reduce stress and ensure no issues getting on the flight. We waited in line for 30 minutes only to be told they would not take our bags until 2 hrs prior to check in. All other airlines are 4 hrs. I was uncomfortable with this and asked about the long line at security as well as boarding being so early and doors being closed 10 minutes before departure on way down. She said you can do priority bag check and the lines at security shouldn’t be that bad. So I am currently stuck outside security with no seats, no food or drinks and stressing out as I watch the security line hoping we can rush through in time to catch our flight. We certainly won’t have any time for dinner before our 8 pm flight so maybe it’s another way to make us spend money on the plane? Not sure but I am certain I will never fly this airline again.",,,,,
  50 degrees and partly cloudy is all it takes to stop a 17 year old minor from flying after being charged 50 bucks for a single carry on that cannot be refunded directly. They can take your payment directly but not issue a refund for a service that was never used. I’ll never use this airline again.,,,,,
" They are seriously going downhill. Bought a ticket for my deaf/disabled son from Flint, MI to Nashville, TN. He had to get a ride to the airport that was over an hour away and was notified that his flight was canceled until after he arrived there. He wasn't given a reason for the cancelation. He tried to communicate with the desk representative and could not understand them. They did not have/were not prepared to deal with a deaf person. My son started to panic and contacted us because he did not know what to do. We had to get him a ride back to Lawrence Technical College and are still trying to figure out how to get him home. I guess the $200 they refunded us is supposed to take care of this mess. I've emailed them and I'm now on hold with them for over an hour. This company is really going downhill. I checked the weather at both airports and it's clear. Haven't been given a reason as to why it was canceled. If they can't provide the service then they shouldn't be selling tickets. And if they are supposed to meet ADA requirements then they should be prepared to have an interpreter on hand to communicate with them. I'll be contacting the ADA to file a complaint.",,,,,
" My husband's flight from Phoenix/Mesa to Idaho Falls was scheduled to leave at 8.30 am. With no explanation, no warning and seemingly no care, it was moved to 2.30 pm. He found out when he was dropped off at the airport. I know you get what you pay for, but even then, Allegiant isn't worth the price. They do not care about customer service or, quite frankly, their customers at all.",,,,,
"  Allegiant first impression with a new customer has been an epic failure. I get a text message and email my flight was canceled within 2 weeks of my holiday travel. How so unkind of a carrier and service. Never again will I book with this discount airline. I should have stuck with Frontier, way way better discount carrier. As I read other reviews I'm not the only one experiencing such thing, if it keeps up I'm sure this airline won't last long.",,,,,
"  I paid an extra $29 so that I could select my seat (6D). Just as I was boarding, my seat was changed to 36D. I was both embarrassed and frustrated as to why this happened. I pay extra for a seat in the front of the plane for a reason. I contacted Allegiant, explained what happened, and expected a refund or credit of $29. Their response was that they would check into it and have heard nothing since.",,,,,
"  Traveling home and canceled flights and couldn't rebook for a whole week, had my children with and left us high. Very disappointed in this airline, shame on you for leaving not only me but other customers in a bind and make other arrangements. Had to get a car rental which was way more then my ticket!",,,,,
"  Allegiant staff was exceptional. They were kind, efficient, and very friendly. Hadn't flown for 25 years and they made it enjoyable. Would fly Allegiant again.",,,,,
"  The vehicle the pushes the plain back broke a part. Therefore, due to some paper issue that the Allegiants Air Staff did not have readily available, we were 1 hour 10 minutes late leaving. This long delay was unnecessary and really messed up our trip plans. ",,,,,
"  I flew from Austin to Orange County CA via Allegiant and had a seamless experience. After reading all the bad reviews, I was nervous, but it turns out, I was one of the lucky ones. My flight had a departure time of 1:50pm and the gate was in the south terminal, away from the main Austin terminal (about a 12 min drive to the other side). My flight started boarding at 1:05. TSA was easy to get through, although they do not have a separate line for TSA Precheck. After walking up the aircraft, I was surprised to see a spacious walking aisle and more legroom than I was expecting. The seats are stiff and do not recline, but you have lots of room for your legs in standard economy. I had a middle seat and was fine. Definitely bring your own entertainment as there is no Wi-Fi or movies available on board. Also, bring snacks and a refillable water bottle filled from the airport. For a $120 last minute ticket, this was better than I expected. We left and landed at the exact time listed. I would recommend.",,,,,
  Horrible experience. The flights keep getting cancelled and none of the airlines staff are ready to help. They have no alternative plains lined up for cancelled flights. The notify only just before 20min of departure.,,,,,
  Worst airline experience ever. Our flight returned back from runway and we were told to wait for 1 hour as there was some technical fault and after an hour we were told that the flight is cancelled and no proper information was given as to what was the technical fault! Because of this we had to reschedule our next flight paying extra money! ,,,,,
"  
Very smooth take off and landing even my mother liked it for safety purpose. Plane was small in size having capacity of 44 passengers, but it was cute and awesome journey.",,,,,
"  I'm traveling from Mumbai to vijaywada, my connecting flight is from Hyderabad, Hyderabad to Vijayawada. I never faced this much worst service by any airline, even these people not having online we check-in, no counters. Finally I'm waiting at gate the flight was 2hrs delay. ",,,,,
" I understand that there could be delays or reschedules due to various reasons and that's why you have your customer care to smooth the process in explaining this but the guy I spoke to was rude, didn't even emphasize on the situation knowing that I was furious about the delay since it was an important meeting. He blatantly tells me that I'll get a full refund. You're serious! Asked if he could do anything in getting me on another flight to which he blindly said, he can't. Horrible customer care.",,,,,
  Worst Flight to travel. The flight was 3 hours delay and there was no proper instructions given. The flight was also dirty. The worst flight I ever traveled and I will not suggest anyone to travel with this one,,,,,
"  Worst airline ever. This started on the 7th of June. We started from Bilaspur (PAB) to Jabalpur (JLR). Our flight was scheduled at 11:10 am but they didn't inform us that there was a delay of 2 hours. At first there was a delay of 1 hour but they kept saying ""Theres a problem with the flight"". So that delayed another hour of our trip. When we got on the plane, they did not stop the engine. When the plane started flying, we expected the AC's to turn on but they did not. My family was very dizzy and saying they were about to throw up. At 8 am on the 9th of June, my dad received a message saying that our flight was delayed again for 2 hours. Listening to that made me mad. Since Jabalpur Airport is larger, it has more Alliance Air flights. There was another flight scheduled for Delhi which was also delayed. The expected boarding time was 12:15 pm but we boarded at 12:40 pm. The aircraft was different, so we thought that the flight was better. But it was the opposite. This flight had too much turbulence. They did not turn on the AC's. They served water at the END of the flight. I said you should've given water in the middle of the flight. She said, ""We're supposed to give water at the end of the flight."" So I strongly do not recommend Alliance Air. And do not dare to even try it out.",,,,,
"  Moment before the flight took off the tyre burst and the flight took a halt.  Even after the flight got cancelled, they did not arrange any accommodation or anything for the passengers and the passengers were asked to arrange their own. Extremely bad service. ",,,,,
"  4+ hour delay with zero information to passengers on cause of delay. No apology, no regret, no information and complete disregard for passengers' time and comfort. Shame on this airline and its operations.",,,,,
"  This is the worst airline I have ever dealt with. They cancelled my flight notifying me at 2am with no other reason but cancelled. I was due to fly out at 8am so had no prior warning and no support from customer service about rescheduling or any sort of help in getting me and my family to our destination. The impact of this flight cancellation meant we had missed our connecting flight to Dubai and we were unable to change connecting flight to continue on with our holiday, so we had no other alternative but to pay extra and return home. Our refund for the cancellation should be automatic, however 3 weeks on and I am still waiting. I have sent 4-5 emails chasing, I have also called their customer service (costing me £50+ just on call chargers) and still have not had a resolution. The support technical confirmed my email and request will be processed that same day, but a week later and still no resolution. There is zero care from this airline, I recommend all to avoid booking using this airline.",,,,,
"  The departure was 9:55 pm from Chennai but it was almost 40 mins delay but no announcement no messages, to the customer. Finally we boarded the tiny aircraft, served small bottle of water at the time flight boarding. We never heard the safety instructions by the cabin crew before the flight. We departed around 10:30 pm and after 1 hour of air journey we suddenly had a massive turbulence. After some time we got small announcement due to High wind/ bad weather conditions we have to wait some more time for landing. We landed safely finally in Hyderabad airport around 12:40AM. ",,,,,
  Pathetic experience. Worst customer service. Rude staff. How can the aviation industry company can have such rude staff. I won't recommend to travel with alliance. Both the staff (Ground and in flight) behave so rude its not at all expected. ,,,,,
"  Very poor approach by the staff, whether it’s from collecting the boarding pass or the cabin crew. Forget about wishing and greeting, their behavior and response is far below par and expectations. Grooming and training the staff in customer service should be the 1st priority of the airline.",,,,,
" Most pathetic airline, totally negligent attitude, inordinate delays, useless staff and careless attitude towards customers. Not worth traveling and have no system of handling.",,,,,
"  I purchased a round-trip ticket on the 28th going up and the 29th coming back from Chennai to Hyderabad. I did my web checkin while on the alliance website. I couldn't download the web checkin receipt or get an email. I called customer service, and the woman on the phone told me right away that there is a problem with the website and I can't get the receipt via email or on my phone. I called her and voiced my displeasure, but she could not give a proper answer. Is this how the clients are handled?",,,,,
"  I had booked a flight with them for Cochin to Lakshadweep in November 2002. I had to cancel the same due to some medical emergencies. I had called them on November 17th, cancelled the ticket and I got an sms confirmation for my cancellation instantly and I was told that I have to do nothing for my refund to be processed. But I mailed them again on the email named [email protected] just to let them know. Apparently, I emailed from a different email id. I had mentioned the proper PNR and sent a reminder on 25th November. But I got no response. I was told about a refund initially and on Dec 20, I called the customer care again and I was told that the refund amount is much lesser. But whatever the case is, no amount was credited. Again, a junior executive told me that the refund will be made in another 7 to 10 days. But later, a senior executive connected on the same call tells me about another policy, that I should have sent the mail to their help desk and not refunds email mentioned on their website. And that too, it should have been sent from my registered email. They didn't respond in spite of me mentioning PNR ans simply coming up with excuses that in spite of their sms that I'll get my money back, they insisted I send an email from my registered email. And when I expressed my dissatisfaction, they offered me some petty rewards in addition to the negligible refund. Never book a ticket with them again and if you do, don't pay extra for flexi. They're simply not a credible airline. I will never travel with this airline. And I would never fly to Lakshadweep until another airline starts service there. I would not recommend anyone to travel with Alliance air. They have such pathetic customer service. And they will keep your money with them unless and until you email and keep calling them. Once you pay, it's their money. You have to beg to get it back.",,,,,
"  Smaller among all domestic airline in India operating only small bodied aircraft connecting tier 2 and tier 3 cities on smaller route. We flown from Udaipur to Ahmedabad, just an hour journey. Check in was smooth and so as boarding, before time departure and arrival. Aircraft used was ATR 72/600 still seat configuration was comfortable, better than A320 or Boeing 737 operated by other domestic airlines. Other than water no meal service. Flight was not as smooth as any narrow bodied still no major problem in comfort. As long as flight tickets are reasonably priced this airline is recommended.",,,,,
"  The worst airline services available till date. They ask for money on each and every step you take towards them. They made changes on their end and asked for payment. Faux changes being made two times, their executives do not want to help, they just reply with you have to make the payment whether we do it or no. Very very very disappointed. Ended up paying 38000Rs for a BOM-IKX-BOM flight. Will never travel with this airline in my entire life again.",,,,,
"  Rude ground crew, cannot even give a face mask worth 10 inr to passengers, that other airlines provide due to covid protocol. Had to buy at airport at 50 inr each,  good nexus with shops in airport lounge. Inflight service poor, seats crowded.",,,,,
  Flight was cancelled after 5 hrs of delay. Boarding was completed and all the passengers were waiting in Bus and Terminal. No Amenities Given Like Water or Washroom Facilities. Manager Came Late and There was no Alternatives done for that. Still the Refund is not Done Yet. They are not Ready to Agree the DGCA Guidelines as-well. Please do not opt this flight ever.,,,,,
"  Never fly with this airline, booked ticket for group. Airline cancelled this route 1 month back but they didn't inform us. Now we need to book alternative airline ticket cost gone high who will bear this additional cost. Now asking for Refund approx. 80k no response from airline side. Sent more than 10 emails no reply yet.",,,,,
"  The flight got delayed by 3 hours without giving any prior notice. They send message 2 hours before flight departure when most of them were already on the way to airport. (Boarding was one hour before and one hour mostly people are taking margin for security check, boarding pass print etc). They didn't provide any support. No one was there at counter as well as at gate also. Also, some flight operators are providing snacks , beverages if night flight and delayed by 2 hours plus. But Alliance air didn't entertain customers like that.",,,,,
"  My first domestic flight I took in India and my first worst experience through an airline. Counters were closed before time and nobody was there to inform travelers about it. It was all empty. There was 4 5 passengers wondering about what is going on. I had connecting flight to Canada and i had to pay amount equal to my flight booking to get my luggage done. Well some how managed to check-in but everyone was shouting at us until we reached the plane. A big zero professionalism. Plane crew was good. But if some customer is spending money on flight then you gonna treat like this and if you know your passengers are there, you gonna leave them behind. It was a worst experience i ever had. will never recommend this airline to anybody. ",,,,,
"  This is new airline but unable to provide better service. Their schedule time was 09.05 for take off but till 11.05 am there was no chances to take off. On their counter no. 112 they given the delay if 1.40 hrs means showing delay schedule timing 10.45 hrs. This is vary cunning strategy to avoid penalty or free meal, because if they wrote 2 hrs they had to provide free meal or refreshment. I do not suggest to fly again in that airline",,,,,
"  This was my first experience in Alliance Air and it was worst experience ever. For 45 mins route from Dehradun to Delhi, we have to wait for 1 hour for this flight on the airport. I will personally never consider Alliance Air to anyone.",,,,,
"  Very good service. Staff was excellent. Water bottle was given. The side table, sleek design of seating, overhead cabin luggage box all was good. Few things require better maintenance. Takeoff and landing was very smooth. I had never flown in a propellor aircraft.",,,,,
"  I had one of my worst travel experiences with Alliance Air. I had booked 3 tickets from Vijayawada to Bangalore 2 months in advance. The total price at the time of booking was Rs. 10,910/- (including all miscellaneous charges). On the date of travel, while checking in, I was informed that I had to pay an extra amount as I had availed of the ""Military discount"" at the time of booking. Nowhere in the booking portal was the ""military discount"" even mentioned. I was asked to pay an additional amount of Rs 10,422 in order to board the flight. So in total, I paid an amount of Rs 21,332/- for an economy class flight from Vijayawada to Bangalore in spite of booking the tickets 2 months in advance. Just like me, there were 18 other co-passengers who had to go through the same ordeal. This is absolute harassment by Alliance Air. From now on, I'm never going to board this airline and will discourage anyone from choosing Alliance Air.",,,,,
"  I travelled with my family - 3 people; They gave seats in 3 different corners of the flight. All those rows, single passengers were sitting. They could have clubbed single passengers together and family together. Do not have a basic system / understanding on how to do that. Poor management.",,,,,
"  Flight was at 6.30 pm From Bangalore to Kechi. They cancelled without intimation. Board was still showing boarding started. After 6.20 when we asked the airline staff they said it’s cancelled. More than 100 people are waiting and staff are playing with phones. Not professional. Finally they said we have 11.00 pm flight, you all go have some food. We were nearby gate suddenly all staff disappeared, we are waiting around, board still showing 11.00 flight. Without notice they are calling one by one person when we asked they are telling that flight got cancelled. 2 flights cancelled and asking us to wait for morning 9.00am flight. Very poor service. ",,,,,
"  This route is operated by ATR 72. Though option of A320 and B737 are available with other airlines the ticket for this ATR is always cheaper than other so went with this and was a good decision. I was traveling with only cabin baggage so no interaction with check in, boarding and departed on time. Check in baggage allowance 15 kg and cabin baggage 5kg. Seats were comfortable. They don’t offer any meal/refreshments service, neither complimentary nor paid, only water is provided/available. Reached Delhi 20 min before time, overall good experience.",,,,,
" In booking this flight, there is no way to purchase more than 15kg per checked in bag on the website. Then when you arrive to check in I was promptly charged an extortionate amount for the excess weight. The ground staff were completely inflexible and only concerned about getting as much money from unsuspecting passengers as possible. The service on the plane was non-existent and I would avoid this airline at all costs.",,,,,
 I am not able to do web check in and their customer care number is on hold for like an hour! Why should I face consequences due to their negligent behaviour. Booking for the first time and such a bad experience! Won’t regret writing this review! Please people don’t waste your time and money on this flight. Book other flights.,,,,,
" The airplane was supposed to take off at 15.35 but we flew late. During the entire journey the arc’s in the cabin were not working, with such hot weather outside and no AC in the cabin all the passengers were agitated and were sweating. The air hostess did not care and kept saying that it will work in 15-20min. The air hostesses were rude and busy in their own gossiping. Worst flight ever.",,,,,
"  Port Macquarie to Brisbane. Dreadful. The age of the plane is ok, however the claustrophobic set up of the cabin is dreadful. The seats were small. We are average sized and were wondering how we were going to fit into the chairs. I have a chronic pain condition and within 20 minutes I was beside myself with being cramped into such a small place. No knee room, no room to reach anything in your handbag on the floor, barely can you put your tray table down. The water and white bread half sandwich was pretty random, not even a cup of tea. How on earth you fit so many overweight people in those seats is beyond me. What happens when large people book 1 seat? Which is the size of half a normal seat?",,,,,
"  Gladstone to Brisbane. I booked this flight through Virgin Australia website. But later I found out that Virgin ceased his service for some cities and gave it over to a new commercial airline called Alliance Airlines. The aircraft was a Fokker 70 with old interior look. The legroom was very tight. The airline's magazine was the only entertainment on board which hadn't been prepared tastefully. On the positive side, the crew were the most friendly cabin crew I've seen in Australian airlines. The complimentary snack (it was a 7:30am flight) was better than what Virgin used to offer. However, the only drink available was water. It is expected for an airline to offer coffee and tea in the morning, at least they can sell a few options on board. The flight time was shorter than usual as it wasn't a propeller aircraft. Handling at both airport was done by Virgin Australia so it wasn't really related to this review. Generally, it's good that a new competitor is entering the market. As a beginner in this sector, they seem to be doing acceptable job. But they should improve some issues to become a rival to other airlines in regional Australia.",,,,,
"  I traveled to La Paz, Bolivia from Paraguay and before mentioning the real problem, they already changed the flight schedule couple times that even doesn't have the time for transfer. I contacted the Amaszonas airline thousands of times and eventually, (and hard) I could change the reasonable time. But the real problem was on coming back travel. The flight attendant from Amaszonas requested the yellow fever vaccinate card of hard copy. I already showed the soft copy of it to the airport and the counter of Amaszonas and there wasn't any problem. But before taking the flight, the attendant asked me the hard copy card and I said her that I already got approved it and they didn't mention anything about it. But she didn't listen it and just made me stand in the corridor for 30 mins and she didn't measure anything. 30 mins later, she just said to me to enter the gate without any explanation or excuse. Maybe it's the reason that I'm the only foreigner among the passengers. I had a joyful time in Bolivia but because of this, I have a bad memory for this flight and even for the country. If you want to experience unpleasant journey, take this airline.",,,,,
"  First time flying with this airline. All in all I've heard positive remarks about them so I've been wanting to take a flight with them. Not much I can say as they did their job properly. Ground and onboard service was fine. As it's a regional airline, I think all of their planes are small sized (i.e. Embraer). The only comment I have about their comapny site. It wasn't easy to buy a ticket there, so I ended up buying it from an agent.",,,,,
" Small plane E190 it was, but everything moved along efficiently. Decent legroom, nothing to rave nor complain about, but more importantly the boarding process was seamless and so was the disembarking process. Baggage arrived with zero issues. Worthwhile noting that tickets were expensive though. Despite all the negative reviews here, it's one of the only options from La Paz to Uyuni other than the Todo Turismo tourist bus (which we took on the way back and was pretty decent as well), so where flights are concerned, just cross your fingers and hope for the best. Do not be afraid after reading all the negativity here. Not all is bad.",,,,,
"  Santa Cruz to Asuncion. I had an international ticket that said “snack”. The snack was food for sale. The airline will not even give you water on their planes. Planes are very old, smelly and dirty and the staff was trying to do their best but were not specially kind or efficient. Seats are very small (two per side, per row) with very little space.",,,,,
"  La Paz to Uyuni. Due to weather issues the airline understandably cancelled our flight to Uyuni, upon learning that rebooking was not an option due to tour constraints we were assured we would be reimbursed and provided the link to give our information. That was June, and in November we still have not received the reimbursement much less any information about it. Despite filling out the paperwork multiple times and sending followup inquiries, they are incredibly unresponsive and have not provided any indication that we will ever see this reimbursement. If you book this airline, be aware their customer service is extremely poor.",,,,,
"  Santa Cruz to La Paz. I forgot my Bose headphones in the plane and contacted the airline already 4 times via their customer services e mail address! I didn't get any response! I am very angry and will never use this airline, I know that it was my fault but not getting any response isn't a good service in 2017. ",,,,,
  La Paz to Rurrenabaque. Avoid - will cancel flights and move you onto other flight times without any contact. We arrived at airport to find both legs had been cancelled and we were on different flight times which meant a complete change of plans and additional costs incurred. They claimed not to have contact details despite us proving we had provided these (as they had contacted us to confirm booking and provide tickets via email). Check in staff will also just shrug their shoulders and will not even provide an apology. Make sure you reconfirm your flight the day before but be warned at the check in desk they reserve he right to cancel / change flights up to 2 hours before with no warning or refund!,,,,,
"  La Paz to Rurrenabaque. They changed our flights last minute with no warning. We were literally at the gate and they told us they had to change the times due to ""operational reasons"". Because of this we are missing an already paid organised tour. This also applies to the flight back from Rurrenabaque. Worst company ever.",,,,,
"  Asuncion to La Paz via Santa Cruz. Booked these flights through Opodo as I could not find Amaszonas website. Flight to take off 1330 with 50 minute stopover in Santa Cruz but nobody could tell me if I had to go through Immigration/Customs and if so, in time for connecting flight. Received flight time change a day later: now with 2 hours 20 minutes stopover. Received third flight time change a further day later: now 0820 from Asuncion with 9 hours  stopover in Santa Cruz. Phoned Opodo and asked for a refund but was asked to wait and see if another flight was available. Received fourth flight time change 10 days later: take off 0820 from Asuncion with 1 hour 30 minutes stopover in Santa Cruz. Received fifth flight time change seven days later: take off 0820 from Asuncion with 1 hour 40 minutes stopover in Santa Cruz. Checked-in for flight and an Australian family was having a loud argument with staff as their flight time had been changed to the afternoon but they had not been informed by Amaszonas. Flight left on time. Yes, had to go through Immigration/Customs in Santa Cruz. I was the first at both but quite a queue formed behind me. Found Departures at Santa Cruz airport and checked-in for flight to La Paz. Had time for a drink. Don't think the first schedule of 50 minutes would have been sufficient. No complaint when actually on the flights but why, oh, why did Amaszonas change my flights 5 times. Did not inspire me with confidence.",,,,,
"  Cusco to Uyuni via La Paz. My experience with Amaszonas was good actually. Luckily the weather was in my favor too. Initially I was a little skeptical after reading reviews, but the trip was pretty smooth. Flight was on the smaller side although not as small as people had initially mentioned. There's about 15 to 20 rows of seats and I was comfortable. THe only thing is they board like 15 minutes prior to departure which makes you a little nervous, but the trip as such was okay.",,,,,
"  La Paz to Rurrenabaque return with Amaszonas. Both flights got canceled. In the first plane were 15 Passengers in a plane for nearly 50 so we think they just wanted to put all the people in one plane and canceled all the other flights. That was the first day we lost in our Trip. No ""sorry"" or any kind of excuse. Flight back got canceled as well, had to stay another night in Rurrenabaque. Weather wasn't really bad. They told us to come to the Office at 7, they drive us to the airport (10 Minutes, departure at 9). When we got there they told us we should take a Taxi on our own. It would still be enough time if we'll be at the airport at 8. So why did you let us wake up and miss breakfast? I wouldn't book Amaszonas again! Don't be surprised if they cancel your flight. Plan more time for it or just take the Bus!",,,,,
"La Paz to Sucre with Amaszonas. Their tickets are expensive compared to other airlines in Bolivia, and don't be fooled by the ""promos"" on the website, the final price is always higher than BoA or ecojet. The ground service is good, they even offer a cheap shuttle to Sucre airport, they claim to have a perfect ""on-time"" record but they have the reputation to cancel trips when the plane is not full enough, onboard service is good with a drink good enough for all the short trips they do and seat room is ok taking count the CRJ 200 is a small plane! The planes are as basic as any regional jet is but are pretty much quiet. Never used it yet but I've been told their La Paz-Santa Cruz air shuttle service is terrific.",,,,,
"  Booked two trips with Amazonas from La Paz to Uyuni and La Paz to Cusco. All tickets were purchased from their website directly and eticket received with email 2 months before trip. 2 days before trip commenced, I tried to complete ""web check in"" but system refused. So I sent an email to check for reason. It turned out both flights were cancelled. We were ""moved"" to a flight on the next day! Amazonas provided no notification or information about the cancellation no until I contacted them. I asked for the reason of the ""no notification"" and they did not answer my question at all. In short, these small South American airlines cancel or reschedule frequently and at their own will without any notification to passengers. Avoid at all cost!",,,,,
"Amaszonas should not be called an airline. Booked a very expensive early morning flight from La Paz to Rurrenabaque. Arrived at the airport 90 minutes early to be told the flight had been changed to 2pm (7 hours later) and that we'd received an email about it. We received the email 2 hours later. Our flight then got changed to 4.40pm then 5.20pm. At 4.20pm we went to the gate just in case and it was empty, no staff, no passengers. Sat down then returned to the gate when a member of staff appeared and were told the flight had already left. Went back to the Amaszonas desk and the incredibly rude staff told us that yes the flight had left but couldn't give us a time of when it left, when it boarded or any details at all. Absolutely shocking, do not give this company any money. Staff need serious customer service training and operations staff need to know how to run a plane timetable.",,,,,
Amaszonas is a disgrace. This is an airline operating in monopoly and they do what they want. We paid US$300 from La Paz to Uyuni and less than 24 hrs before departure they cancelled our flight without giving us any reason (neither by email nor by telephone). We were rescheduled on another flight. US$300 for a 40 mins flight and they cancel it because the flight is not full. Our entire schedule in Uyuni completely screwed up. ,,,,,
"Flew La Paz to Uyuni and return. Check-in was easy and outbound flight was on time. No bag fees or seat selection fees. Limited snack service on the plane - choice of coffee, juice, water or soda but adequate for a 45 minute flight. No IFE but with the Andes on one side and lakes and salt flats on the other it wasn't really needed. Seat pitch was surprisingly good - not sure of the measurement but I had a few inches clearance for my knees (I am 6' tall) which is better than economy class on most of the legacy carriers. Return flight delayed by about 30 minutes but not a major problem. Had to change our return flight and the fee was about US$4.00 so I can't complain about that. The only odd thing was the baggage handling at Uyuni. The ground crew unloaded the bags onto a cart but kept it there while they then loaded the outbound flight. After the cart was bought to the bag claim, we were not allowed in until all the bags were place in the claim area. Sort of an odd arrangement and not sure if that is on the airline or the airport ground crew. All in all a reasonable flight experience. Recommended.",,,,,
" American Airlines has lost any sense of urgency. Shrouded in the incompetent cloak of blame TSA, blame air traffic control, blame the ramp team. The bottom line is you are late —- you miss your flight and the couldn’t give a flip less. Thanks Boston team on AA0415. You ruined my trip, my evening and my work day because you couldn’t hold AA1494 just eight minutes. Especially when you do it when it suits you. New rule. I will drive anything 10 hours. 10 flipping hours rather than deal with your self entitled drama.",,,,,
" Horrible customer service over the phone. Dealt with a life or death emergency flight and explained my entire situation. Spoke with roughly 5 different representatives to manage cancelling my flight. 4/5 representatives assured me my refund would go through as I cancelled less than 24hrs from the time I purchased. 2 WEEKS later I get an email stating my refund is not possible nor exchangeable although it is mentioned on their website that it IS possible. Last representative I spoke with even mentioned waiting A DAY to process my refund and when I explained that 4 representatives told me what to do she stated, ""You can do what they told you or you can do what I'm telling you to do its your call"" and hung up on my call. Left her a bad review on the after-call survey and still ended up waiting 2 weeks for no other communication other than my money being lost and gone. Not the first issue I've had with this airline and will never fly with them again NOR recommend to anyone.",,,,,
"  This is the worst experience I have ever had. While coming back from India, AA didn't gave me any baggage allowance for my international flight ticket. I have pay for my luggage and then they suggested me to claim a refund. So after coming back I have to go through that hassle too. They are supposed to give us 3 meals in our 16 hour flight where as they just gave us 2 meals and they skipped the other meal by giving us an ice cream only. I'll not recommend this airline at all. If they can't give proper service, they should shut it down.",,,,,
  Arrived 1.45 hours before flight. Missed flight due to check in staff unable to process a short line of people in an efficient manner. Watched 6 check in staff unable to process a short line of 20 people in 45 minutes. The incompetence was astounding to have missed a flight due to a simple process of checking people in. Instead they dilly dallied on just a few customers never thinking nor caring that they are making others miss their flights. I don't believe they are unaware of their actions. They simply don't give a damn.,,,,,
"  Los Angeles to Dallas Fort-Worth onboard AA2833 on their A321-200. My flight departed from the rather small-sized Terminal 4, and with the amount of layover I had plus the quick service in Los Angeles, I had plenty of time to kill in the Admirals Club lounge which was very cozy and comfortable. The staff in Los Angeles were just okay. Boarding started on schedule and it was very disciplined, and I was welcomed in quite a friendly way by the crews. Take-off was only 10 minutes late, but eventually, we landed half an hour ahead of schedule. Their A321 had slightly larger overhead bins and strip LED lighting, but sadly no personal TVs. The seat was cozy and comfortable, easy to use, and adequately spacious for a 2.5-hour flight like this. Throughout the flight, the flight attendants were friendly, courteous, and attentive, although they could've been better if they were not just meddling with their phones and re-ensure that everyone is doing okay. once the service is complete. The Biscoff biscuit was exquisite and tasty. The real positive thing about this flight was the Wi-Fi. It allowed me to browse anything, open social media apps, and watch videos on the ground for around 20 minutes. Once I took off, the social media apps and browsing feature no longer existed, but live TV shows, videos, movies, and games were provided through the American Airlines portal. The signal strength was quite poor, but the contents and the layout of the portal were incredibly good. Despite landing 30 minutes ahead of schedule, the baggage delivery at Dallas Fort Worth was ridiculously slow, causing me to wait around 45-60 minutes. Overall, my experience and first impression onboard American Airlines was somewhat impressive. Also, if you're asking for help, contact them via Twitter or use the Live Chat feature. They can sometimes be faster than the phone team.",,,,,
"  Completely awful airline. This is the only airline that I have horrible experiences with. The first time I had a horrible experience I figured it was a one off, this last time they canceled my flight last minute after delaying it three times. I had a jump on a random flight and pay a Uber driver almost $400 to drive me 2 1/2 hours from one airport home because I had to be home to my kids and work. As they did not give me options I had to figure this out myself then they completely lost my bag. It has been all over the US. I get different stories from every person I speak to. I’ve spoken to seven different people and they’ve all giving me different stories. When I reached out to American, they offered me a $25 flight credit. It was almost insulting after everything I had been through with this airline and all the hoops I had to jump through and they lost my bag to offer me $25 flight credit thinking I would ever fly with them again is horrible. I highly recommend even if it another airline is more expensive. It is way worth it. It is not worth going through what I went through and nobody that works for them will care.",,,,,
" 7 hour flight and no meals or snacks (other than biscoff cookies). Website indicates snack boxes for purchase. Not the case for most on the flight. I didn't think I needed to pack my own food for the kids because I usually fly Delta. Also, I almost missed my flight because they moved it up 2 hours and sent NO notifications of the change. Luckily I double checked my flight the night before.",,,,,
"  This was in regards to attempting business travel and not finding resolution in the online available connections offered. I decided to determine what flights were actually available from RDU through Charlotte onto final destination of STL. Finding the options I needed, I called ""customer service"" to ask if they could simply join the individual segments I found since it wasn't being offered as connecting flights on AA.com. The CSR said it's called a ""Merit"" itinerary (or something like that) and quoted a price about 50% higher than those offered online. The csr had a poor attitude, very terse in his interaction with me and ultimately did not care about my satisfaction. But, I believe it's a larger problem at American Airlines. If I need to travel to a final destination and must connect through another city and flights are published on AA.com in individual segments and are available, why can't American Airlines accommodate the customer and simply book the individual flights at no additional cost to a loyal customer? I've noticed this being true with Award Travel - whoever is in charge of managing the connecting schedules for those customers who need to travel with connections, is not at all customer-focused and needs to attend a few seminars on how to continue to satisfy the customer. ",,,,,
"  American Airlines is the worst airline I have ever flown with. I will never, every fly with them again. My most recent trip was a nightmare. First, our flight was cancelled and this didn’t notify us. We waited to check-in and check our bags for over 2 hours before we found out our flight was cancelled. They managed to get us on another flight, but then we sat in the plain without moving for 2 hours. Apparently, they didn’t know how to weigh the plane. At least, that’s the excuse they gave when they started making the flight attendants count the passengers, and that was after an hour and half of sitting there with no news. Because of that delay, we missed our connecting flight to Japan. We waiting over 2 hours in line for help and would have waiting longer had I not flagged down a random employee and begged for help. They were able to put us on a different route, adding over 12 hours to our trip. To top it off, they lost our baggage. Our baggage sat in the USA for 3 days before they found it and sent it to us. They are the most incompetent, ignorant, sloppy airline I have ever encountered and will now go to great lengths to avoid.",,,,,
"  Like most of the other reviews mine also deals with flight changes, delays, and missed connections. From LAX to PHX the flight went as planned but once in PHX they said we missed connecting flight. We did not miss any flight through fault of our own. The previous day that sent an email that ask to change flights and be compensated. I refused as I had a planned schedule. Since I refused to delay voluntarily I think they just booted me to the later flight. In PHX we were switched to three different gates and two different flights. Our plan included an 5 hour drive from our destination airport, ABQ , to Amarillo which was close to home. We had left our vehicle in ABQ and were suppose to pick it up around 7 PM for our drive home. We ended up in ABQ at almost midnight and we were dead tired so decided to not make the drive and just spend the night. I am currently seeking compensation for the room and expensive meals we had to eat at the airport. I doubt that I will ever choose AA again. I was also not happy with the airplane A320 and the way they seated passengers. We were four, two adults and two teens, The adults were seated 5 rows back from the teens which might not have been so bad if the plane were full but there were empty rows, not seats, rows behind our teens. We also noted three grown men had to share a row when there were plenty of empty seats that they should have been seated in for better comfort.",,,,,
" Flight to Milwaukee was delayed multiple times for several hours and eventually canceled. I understand things happen and was not initially that upset about the cancelation even though it resulted in me having to sleep on the ground in the airport for 5 hours. My return flight which was 4 days later, was also canceled within hours of departure. This flight was rescheduled for the following day. I have lost all confidence in American Airlines and will avoid flying with them in the future.",,,,,
"  I will never fly with this airline again. On 7/16, my husband and I were returning from a very much needed vacation from Montego Bay Jamaica and had a connecting flight from MIA to Boston. Upon the flight being delayed 4 times they eventually cancelled the flight all together leaving us confused because this is the first time we've experienced this issue. Lady at the desk told us to rebook at gate 14 so my husband and everyone else went to gate 14 only to find out we were in the wrong place. After waiting 3 hours in line we found out there would be no more flights from MIA to Boston until 2 days later. Both my husband and I were expected to return to work the following day yet now we are stuck in FL for 2 additional days. I went to another gate that had just boarded near by, a flight going to Rio de Janeiro, to ask if they knew where we could find our luggage and to my shock the 2 women behind the desk were talking trash about the people waiting in the now 5 hour line to rebook cancelled flights. I stood there as the 2 employees spoke to each other saying how the people standing in line are ""stupid because they are wasting their time because customer service wont help them"" and laughed about how they would be going home soon after their shifts. Upset I approached the woman behind the desk and let her know that I was one of the people standing in line and looked at me wide eyed as the other employee walked away I asked her if she could do something besides speaking on people she doesn't know and tell me where I can locate my luggage. She told me I would have to go elsewhere to baggage customer service and ask them and told me to please be patient and I replied just like I was now when she felt the need to make fun of people she doesn't know. I walked away and my husband and I went downstairs to find the baggage customer service and after waiting in line yet again for an hour, another employee walked over to tell everyone in line that we are wasting our time. He announced that all the baggage from the canceled flights were in back and no one is going through them because it's too many luggage to go through. Everyone in line became very upset, some yelling at the employee asking what he meant. One man lost his mind telling the baggage guy that the people from upstairs sent him down here for his bags and the baggage guy told him that they only do ticketing and we do baggage and said they don't know what their talking about and no one from the canceled flights would be getting their bags. Angry I went up to the desk to ask if there was anyway possible to retrieve our luggage, we will now be in FL for 2 days without clothes and bags. Also 5mths pregnant, all of my clothes and other things were in my luggage. The lady at the desk told us she had no idea where our luggage is but she would put some note into the system so me and my husband would be able to pick up our luggage at the customer service desk in the morning. Upon searching for hotels for the night as I am pregnant and refused to sleep in the airport and of course everywhere near the airport was booked up. We found a hotel by luck and got there after 5am the next morning 3 more hours later after using Uber to get around town looking for available rooms. Next morning we went back to baggage only to find out the girls note was overridden and our bags were now in Boston so we had no luggage. How are we to be compensated for all the time and money lost dealing with the AA employees?",,,,,
"  My flight was scheduled to leave at 7:17 am. Since I am supposed to get to the airport 1.5-2 hours before the flight, I was up early and arrived at 5:15am. At 5:36 am I received a notification from American that this flight was delayed until 9:45am because of ""logistical issues"". As a result I missed my connecting flight. I was supposed to get into Little Rock for 11:15am and now have a connecting flight putting me in little rock for 8:26pm. Having read the reviews on American Airlines before booking this flight, I should have heeded the warnings. Lesson learned! Wanted to give American Airlines a chance to prove the reviews wrong. I was wrong, American lives up to its subpar reviews. Because of ""logistical issues"" rearrange my transportation, reservations and housing. I have never flown American before and will never fly them again.  I tried to call American Airlines and was on hold for 36 minutes. Never got to talk to a person.  I fly 6 times a year on average, United, Delta, Jet Blue have been seamless. American is in the bottom tier for a reason, great way to put yourself out of business.",,,,,
"  After delaying our flight for 2 hours, we boarded and then sat on the tarmac for another hour. They then decided to go back to the airport. Waited another 2 hours, boarded again, came off again. This happened 3 times. By 10pm (flight was supposed to leave at 6.15pm), so by this time I knew I missed my connecting flights back to Australia. They decided the Tyre needed replacing. No help with organizing another flight for me (4 flights in total to get back to Australia). No offer of accommodation or food. All I got was “connecting flights will be same tomorrow”, no new boarding passes issued, nothing. Got kicked out of the main airport area at 11pm, so was stuck in the foyer area from 11pm to 6am. At that time I contacted my travel agent to make sure they had me on the next flight, and they didn’t, she lied to me. So I had to try and find a hotel that would take me at 6am in the morning. The hotel that took me is another story. Desperate times call for desperate measures. My travel agent ended up booking my flights 2 days later, no thanks to American Airlines. (Oh, and they also lost my sons bag for 2 weeks, he only had the clothes he was wearing all that time). Got to the airport and funnily enough the same lady that lied to me served me at checkin. “Oh I feel so sorry for you, I’m going to give you an exit row seat on your 1st flight”, she said - little did she know I had paid for the exit row seat just hours before anyway, so it was already my seat. So she lied yet again, pretending to do me a favor! So all in all my son was without everything for 2 weeks, they cancelled my flights twice, no accommodation or food offer, no rescheduling my flights after lying to me saying they were, and it’s been 5 weeks and I’m still trying to get compensated for the Uber costs to and from the hotel, food and accommodation that I had to organise, 1 day of work that I missed. The thing that struck me though, was the complete lack of empathy, they did not care less.",,,,,
"  The flight from Boston to Indianapolis with my partner was not bad, but come back was just miserable all around. I have had several bad experiences with American Airlines on both domestic and international flights in the past; old, dirty planes, lack of any inflight entertainment (other than old drop down ancient TVs from what-appears-to-be from the 1960s), inadequate leg room, etc. But the last few times I have flown with them, it was not too bad and the planes were better; cleaner, etc. but I had one of those experiences again! It was like going back to 2011, 2012 with American! Not only was the plane my partner and I flew this time around; both on the flight to and from, old and decrepit (relatively clean, but extremely dated), there was hardly any legroom whatsoever.  This journey was made even more miserable because one of the flight attendants in the back of the plane was rude and dismissive when I had to get up and use the restroom. She told me to ""sit down because of turbulence"". There was no turbulence at that point. It got to the point where I waved up to another flight attendant at the front of the plane if I could use the restroom up there and he was very friendly and understanding and said I could ""but to make it quick before the turbulence"" and sure enough I was able to do so (it was also an emergency). He was so nice, and I was able to sit back down before the turbulence (which got pretty bad at one point), but the other female flight crew member denying me access to the restroom when there was not any turbulence at one point was rude and unprofessional. I will do everything in my will power to avoid American Airlines at all costs going forward. ",,,,,
  American airlines delayed our flight 5 times in a matter of hours due to personnel issues. This caused us to miss our connecting flight. They wanted to rebook us on a flight 2 days later. It took me 6 hours to get an answer as to why this was happening and find a new way home which was $2000. When I emailed customer relations (no one would speak on the phone) they offered me a $25 travel credit. This doesn't even cover 1 ticket. I don't recommend American airlines.,,,,,
"  American has literally managed to screw every one of my family members on three separate occasions. They delay for no reason. And when they delay, it is so excessive that connecting flights are missed. Do not fly American, you will regret it. It cost me $830 to rebook with another airline. I only got a refund of $300. Worst experience ever. My son is now going to be stuck in New York because of their stupid delays.",,,,,
"  A horrible experience and even worse customer relations after the fact. My most recent flight with American Airlines was delayed by 17 hours and customer relations refuses to give me a refund. I was/am pregnant and was traveling with my 18 month old son. Our layover between flights was supposed to be only 1 hour and turned into a stressful, exhausting 17 hour delay. We waited until 1 am at our gate when we were told to change terminals entirely to go to different gate. After waiting an hour more at this new gate, American Airlines canceled the flight entirely for that night. We were given an $11 meal voucher and told to “book our own hotels” and American would reimburse us. Finally at 4 in the morning I was able to get my 18 month old son to sleep at a hotel we had to book and get an Uber to with no help from American. We only were able to stay for 4 hours before heading back to the airport. When we got back our flight was delayed again. We boarded a plane, we’re told to get off and change planes and wait. It was so tiring and during this time no more meal vouchers were offered so I was paying for everything out of pocket. I missed two days of work because of this fiasco. Since this trip from hell, I have been contacting American Airlines and offered no refunds or compensation. The only thing I was given was a $25 credit for my next flight. No I am not kidding. $25! Not even a refund for the hotel they promised to pay for! I quite literally lost over a thousand dollars because of this flight and I do not have that kind of money. Absolutely the worst experience ever. I am so disappointed in American Airlines and would recommend that people fly with literally ANY other airline.",,,,,
" American Airlines itself is a decent airline, but the fact that approx. 5 - 7% of their flights are direct flights is a capital crime. Almost every trip requires a connection, with about 85 - 90% of those connections being in Charlotte. It is kind of funny that lot of the budget airlines, like Spirit & Frontier among others offer a majority of direct travel all across Canada & The US. How is American Airlines not jumping on this. Honestly, a stopover is not bad, especially if you love flying, like I do. However with American, a stopover is a bittersweet thing. Firstly, a stopover could be anywhere 40 minutes to 1 hour. Hearing that you initially think ""OK, not bad at all"" then you have your first flight delayed for a bogus reason, rendering your connection pointless, which is frustrating. Frustration increases usually because with American Airlines, your first flight will be an evening flight, and after the delay, you get to your connection 1 hour late if not more, and you have to stay all night in the airport to get your connecting flight first thing in the morning. Yay! If you are lucky to get a representative at a ticket booth, which will be few & far between if that, you will be given some sort of miss-information in regards to why your flight was delayed. After finding out that upgrading my seat from aisle to window, would be $54, US as well. That's fun! American Airlines screws up and still wants to charge for trying to rectify the situation. Like us customer are the inconvenience. After saying no, I actually had a representative tell me ""You can certainly book a flight with United"" what kind of answer is that. Your airline messes up and your advice is have a customer pay more money with a different airline. Alright then! WiFi on American is not the best either, unless you are a Xfinity or Verizon member. If not, don't expect any internet access besides the American Airlines site allowing you to check other American Airlines flights to see your connecting flight is on time and knowing you will miss it. Prices for WiFi on the airline range from $15 - $20, just to use the WiFi on 1 device only. Oh Joy! I do realize airlines screw up sometimes, it's a part of travel. The whole ""it's about the journey, not the destination"" thing. However, at least have the decency to be honest with customers about what is going on and try to accommodate them. The very least you can do is try to keep the customer. At least with your own airline. As much as I love flying, a direct flight is certainly better than this headache I endured. American, please get your stuff together. Remember, you are not the only airline in the skies. Simply put, I almost missed a friend's wedding because of the American Airlines headache.",,,,,
"  Flight from OAJ was delayed by an hour due to bad weather (which is understandable) departed at 7pm, didn't get to CLT until 8:10 pm, CLT is huge and it takes like 15 minutes to get to my gate, causing me to miss my connecting flight to BWI at 8:28 pm. But I managed to arrive 2 minutes left at B9. However, I was notified that my gate changed to B12. It's 8:29, so I run over and now the door to my connecting flight is closed. Too late to board. Gate agent couldn't help me, so I was directed to AA Customer Service, which took 2 hours to wait in line. Waited in line, and on the phone for an hour. I couldn't get a flight change on the phone, luckily I was near the end and got told that my flight was actually delayed? But it literally left when I arrived. Then was told that I was checked in, meaning someone was checked in with my seat before I arrived late. That I paid for. Odd. Finally I got another flight which was delayed by an hour. It took 5 hours to get me home. This was my first AA mishap, and it was trying to say the least.",,,,,
  Mellisa from American Airlines is the one who saved a summer vacation for her diligent and quick efforts to save our flight which was cancelled at the last minute. She’s the hero to 3 kids who will have a blast and will experience memories that will last a lifetime. That’s sometimes all it takes. Doing the part that we’re meant to do and doing it with heart.

" My family's flight was canceled an hour before it was scheduled to take off. We were rerouted to an airport 90 minutes away from our final destination. At no point did American Airlines try to get us all the way home. They left us stranded at the airport with no way home other than to rent a car and pay out of pocket to drive home. When I asked for a reimbursement, they absolutely refused. They claimed they can't reimburse people based on weather cancelations. I told them this wasn't about the weather cancelation, it was about them stranding us at an airport 90 minutes away from our final destination and not reimbursing us for having to get ourselves all of the way home. I will never fly this airline again and, if you're smart, you won't either.",,,,,
" First off, I paid for a first class ticket! A lot of money! I fly monthly and I always fly first class. When I got to the airport I went to scan my e-ticket which clearly showed I have a first class seat. The machine said I was too late to check luggage. It didn’t make sense. I was 2 hours early. A very nice woman helped me and she fixed it and checked my luggage. And I got my luggage tickets and my luggage was marked priority. When I went to check in at the gate I was told to step aside. A female agent said the ticket not in the system despite my having my boarding pass. So she asked a male agent to assist me. He was extremely mean and rude. He said I wasn’t on the flight. I showed him my confirmation email, my e-ticket that showed my seat number and he said it didn’t matter. I don’t exist in in the system. He then assigned me a new seat in economy. I told him I paid for a first class ticket. He said you didn’t tell me that. Ask for a refund. Had he actually looked at my ticket he would’ve seen that I was first class. I didn’t want to make scene so I moved on. When I passed through the first class cabin my seat was empty. I do not know if it filled after, but I was one of the last ones on the plane. I imagine it went empty. I probably should have just showed my e ticket and I could have sat down, but honestly I was so taken back by the way I was just treated I wasn’t thinking. I have sent an email to my travel agent to ask her how I can get a refund of the difference. I fly first class because I fly frequently and it helps me to me rested for important meetings. I spend a lot of my hard earned money. I was treated horribly by the agent at the gate. I do not tolerate that behavior and do not reward it with further business. I can tell you, I will absolutely never fly American Airlines ever again and I will never recommend them to any body ever again based on my experience on this particular trip. I don’t appreciate being treated so badly. There was no cause for him to be this way, other than he enjoyed pushing his weight around. So American Airlines, you lost a customer.",,,,,
  First off I agree I could’ve better planned on my end. But I spent 10 hours at the airport to basically find my own solution. 3 visits to the customer service line and 2 phone calls before I decided this is ridiculous. My first flight out I missed by 5 mins even though I watched them give other stand by people my seat. There was a bad storm that delayed everyone. I was put on stand by 3 times before I’m like no this can not be the solution. My 3rd visit to customer service was met with limited reps and basically the last rep showing no empathy after I’ve been running around the entire airport for 7 hours just to get oh no the flight is overbooked. I ended up just purchasing a new ticket through JetBlue and let my anxiety not get the best of me. The reason I missed my flight is because pre-check took 40 mins to get through. No one had a sense of urgency. 10 people missed my flight so don’t you think that’s a big issue. I get it if it was only me but 10. The same people running from flight to flight. American wanted to wait on standby until the next day. I'm on a business trip for work there is no next business day. I'm just upset that it took so much time waiting to get no resolution and then me deciding to take my fate into my own hand where it got resolved. I will be calling American to get a travel credit after the amount they screwed me over. I’ll better plan my trip next time but American get better and treat your customers right. There was over 50 standby at one point. Y’all need to think of a better solution.,,,,,
"  I don't often complain, however, I've noticed a trend with American Airlines always delayed, canceled or changes. I've purchased our tickets months ago only to be downgraded to a class that I've worked hard to pay for. I understand there are other customers in worse situations, however if it had only been a one time thing, I would've not bothered but I've tried a few more times after and have been completely disappointed. My fault for expecting to get what I pay for with this airline. This will most certainly be the last time we give our business to American Airlines. Disappointed.",,,,,
  This was the worst experience I ever had at the airport. I missed my flight due to the negligence of the customer ice agent. When I complained about the service the agent was very disrespectful. I waited over an hour to see a manager. So I canceled my flight and booked with Delta. The experience with Delta was great. My company will never use this airline. ,,,,,
" Trying to return home from our honeymoon and our first flight was delayed, but so was our second one from Charlotte to Cincinnati so we made it in time. While in line we heard them give my husbands seat to a passenger in front of us, when scanning our boarding passes they didn’t work, but our checked bags scanned? While in line for customer support (which was forever long) we were the next people in line and a worker pulled two groups to go to a gate worker to get the line down. We said no we wanted to stay, we were next in line. He told us we had to so another 2 hours later we are still in line at the gate and the gate worker had no clue what he was doing. So I went back and stood in line again at customer service. I made it to the front again before my husband moved so I called him to come back over. At the gate the worker would not look up where another customers bag was because they said over and over again that if you don’t make it on a flight neither does your bag. So at customer service we were very nice in which we did not get in return. Asked us why we didn’t know what flight we were on? Told us they rebooked us for 6 pm the next day. There were no hotels, no rental cars. So our only option was to stay at the airport for close to 20hrs. With no solution or compensation or anything. We then asked her if she could check where our bags were, in which she told us that if we didn’t get on the flight neither did our bags. We asked again if she could just check. So she did and was very annoyed about it and sure enough, our bags were on the flight without us. We asked how that happened, then another customer service representative said we have no idea you’re not talking to the right people about that? Who else would we talk to about that? Would not recommend flying this company to anyone.",,,,,
 This airline blows. Delay after delay after delay. All over a stewardess. Get me on a plane. I will never fly this thing again. Know so many people that work here but we’ve got delayed on all 4 of the flights and they lost our baggage going into Mexico. Absolute shame of a business for one of “the biggest and best”.,,,,,
" American Airlines you no longer exist in my world. My parents 50th anniversary was a magical event! The Common Man Restaurant was amazing and Courtney was a delight but back to American Airlines. Cancelled my parents flight 15 minutes before it was due to leave! The call to customer service was awful they would not pass the call to a supervisor, nor would they compensate my parents for the serious issues they created. They were told this is a personal problem! The best they can do a flight Tuesday night! My parents car is in parking racking up the bill, their dogs are being boarded at a substantial cost, and the customer service person would not identify herself - she didn’t feel comfortable! As they say, no way to run an airline! American Airlines, way to ruin a wonderful occasion!",,,,,
"  Absolutely rubbish customer service. From beginning to end flight attendants were disinterested, rushed, unorganised and totally focused on doing as little as possible. Food was borderline inedible and unacceptable for a route of that length. Seat is uncomfortable and cramped. This airline should not be able to codeshare with other oneworld partners as they don’t even come close to their levels of service. I would never use them again.",,,,,
" Overall, it was a terrible experience. My flight was originally scheduled for 10:40pm, but then it was delayed to midnight, a few minutes later it was delayed to 12:30, then 4:00am, and finally 7:30am. By the time we were made aware that the flight was going to leave in the morning, it no longer made logical sense to take a hotel voucher because by the time you would have made it to the hotel, you would have to leave an hour later to make it through TSA, so almost everyone on my flight decided to spend the night at the airport. In return, customer service representatives gave us $12 food vouchers. This is unacceptable. Not to mention, the customer service representatives were in a terrible mood and I do not blame them. They deserve better than having to tell a hundred angry customers back to back that all they can do is give a $12 food voucher. I am disappointed and will not be flying with American again. It is in your best interest to do the same.",,,,,
 This airline is poor when it comes to accountability for making people miss their flights I wouldn't ever suggest American for business trips or anything that you have a specific time to be there. We had to sit for 45 minutes for some unknown reason before we were able to get off which caused several people to miss their flights. I missed my flight and the only available flight for my destination is the following day in the evening so now I've lost an important client because the gates were closed and I wasn't allowed to board. American need to have all their employees communicate so things like this won't happen.,,,,,
"  Let's start with the fact that we boarded the flight in Charlotte and then told the flight was canceled. No instructions on what to do. They gave our plane to the people going to Syracuse because their plane had mechanical problems. Finally I was told to go to airline services where the line was almost 100 yards long. I went to another terminal and they didn't have any flights to Albany, NY. Now I have to spend the night in the airport because they won't put me in a hotel for the night. Next flight is in the morning but I have to go to Washington DC and another 4 hour layover. While sitting here they boarded people onto a plane without interior lights only to make them get off again. Several flights had to switch gates so people are going every which way.",,,,,
" Me and my wife landed in Dallas to connect with our plane to College Station. We were desperate to see our daughter who just got out of the hospital the day before. Because we were unable to deboard (gate not open?) we ran to the connecting gate (actually took the airport train) only to find out that they moved the gate. We took the train back and arrived to the now correct gate 8 minutes before take-off and were not allowed to get on our 4:50pm flight, We went to American customer service and were told the next flight was after 10 pm and that it had no seats left. Agent gave us two standby passes and said we would not know if we can get on unless two people sis not show up or cancelled and we would not know until 10 pm until the after 10 pm. I asked 'what do we do if we do not get on this plane?' Well we were told we can apply to get a hotel room. Mind you I am 70 years old and dog tired from being at the Nashville Airport for leg one of our journey at 8am that morning, We could wait until after 10pm if we knew we had a seat but not just to be told we were denied. We had to see our daughter! I took an Uber to College Station and the Uber driver drove us over an extra 100 miles to charge us more, which was not the original route or price. I am dealing with that. I called American to see if we could get reimbursed and was told that the I should of gotten on the 10:00 pm flight as there Were 5 SEATS! The agent lied to us! I am very disappointed at American and their shoddy customer service.",,,,,
"  Flight was delayed on top of a 4 hour layover to the point where I missed my flight home and the next flight had to be the next time. That was after switching us from our first class ticket to economy, which means our plans for the evening meal were completely ruined. A 12 dollar meal voucher doesn't really cut it. Also, on the flight in the in flight meal sucked anyway. Like, some of the worst food I've been subjected to in a while. I'm never voluntarily flying American again in the future. All in all a horrible experience.",,,,,
"  American Airlines customer service sucks. While booking my tickets for 4 passengers (4 months before travel) and per baggage policy in American Airlines as well as in their codeshare, I had first free checked bag per passenger. I got the first free checked bag per passenger in my outbound flights. But then in the inbound flights, Qatar didn't allow a free checked bag. Qatar tells me “American re-issued the tickets on 5th Jul (just 4 days before the actual inbound travel) and removed free checked bag, and thus they had to charge me.” After multiple follow ups with American Airlines customer relations, they are not even ready to tell me why they did re-issue the tickets on 5th Jul (booking was done in Feb), and why did they remove free checked bag in the re-issued ticket on 5th Jul.  American Airlines is not even ready to deeply look into what went wrong in their system/process, and not ready to refund ($420 charged total for 4 checked in bags for 4 passengers). Absolutely 100% sure mistake of American Airlines, and still not willing to give it a serious consideration. I am done with American Airlines.",,,,,
"  Every time I fly American Airlines there is always a delay. This time we sat on plane waiting to take off for 2 hrs. Missing our connecting flight in Dallas. This airline does not care about its passengers, they don’t care about safety or if you miss your flight e aisles of there technical issues. If one flight is late and there is a lot of people on the delayed flight for connecting flight, they should wait for the passenger.  Their service is low budget. They’re unorganized and unpredictable. Take your money to Delta or Southwest. Never flying with them again in my life. Ruined our Trip. Now we have to sleep in the airport. ",,,,,
" My luggage had an air tag in it. I took a photo as it was being checked in. My luggage was checked through from Chiang Mai to JFK. When I arrived at JFK, one of my bags was missing so I filled out the paperwork. My air tag said that my suitcase was in Doha but the agent insisted that it was still in Bangkok. She refused to make note of this and was not interested in a photo of my luggage. So….time passed, I called again as my luggage was still in Doha after several days. She still insisted that it was in Bangkok. Then my luggage traveled to JFK, Terminal 8 — right next to Dunkin Donuts but… she still insisted that it was in Bangkok. If she opened her eyes, it was likely right in her office. After several more days, it traveled to Newark and she still insisted it was in Bangkok. This morning it arrived at the Syracuse airport and eventually at my home by FedEx. But, no one ever notified me that my luggage was found and that it was being delivered. American Airlines systems are broken and their personnel are poorly trained. Last year, they refused to let 25+ people board the plane in Doha because we were about 10 minutes late arriving but the plane did not depart for over 2 hours causing all of these people to be rebooked. American Airline is part of the problem instead of being part of the solution. Avoid flying with them whenever possible!",,,,,
"  I will never fly American again. Supposed to take off at 9 and here we are still sitting at 10.15. This is after we had to taxi all the way back to the gate because they forgot the log book. Kept us sitting for at least 30 minutes with no updates until we're told the pilots are over their flight hours and now we have to wait for another crew. Shouldn't that have been figured out ahead of time. Not to mention American took away mine and my husband's seats and made us pick new ones that we couldn't even sit together. The only explanation offered was maybe it was a flight swap. So like I said, never again will I fly this incompetent airline and will warning others to do the same. I understand things happen but this seems like major human error that could have been avoided instead of at the inconvenience of numerous passengers.",,,,,
"  The customer service at the gate in Atlanta GA on flight AA 2591/02 going to Miami July 2nd around 1:00 was so horrible I don’t know how they have a job there. I have worked in customer service for 15 years and I have never in my life spoke to a customer in the manner this lady spoke to myself my husband and my two children. She was extremely rude and her comments were unnecessary. We were flying standby. Once boarding started, I walked to the counter to see if any standby tickets had been cleared. She said no. So I proceeded to step to the side and continue my phone call with Carnival cruise line to let them know we are arriving late. Not even 3 minutes later my family is calling my name for us to board. As we were gathering our belongings and walking up to the boarding gate she yells to me and my family, y’all moving pretty slow to be on standby, and says to me you was just up here asking if you were cleared but you taking your time. She made my 7 and 12 year old very uncomfortable when she made those remarks. It takes a lot to upset me but she pushed that button so quickly and doesn’t deserve her job with AA.",,,,,
 Very bad experience as usual. Delay in departing from Buffalo airport. The airplane was overweight so we have to wait for 2 passengers to give up their seats. Also arrived at Chicago airport and have to wait almost 2 hours to get off the airplane.,,,,,
"  Flew to DFW from Vancouver one way after attending a wedding. No delays on inbound flight. The flight was smooth with very little turbulence encountered. Kudos to American Airlines flight crew. They were polite and friendly. Premium Economy seat had enough legroom for a comfortable flight. Service is typical (biscotti, snack and soft drinks) of all domestic flights. American does a pretty good job of getting you were you want on their domestic and trans border flights.",,,,,
 American gave away aircraft twice and now no pilot! Incremental delays keep you chasing updates and gate changes. We are 4 hours in and still no hope. Spending 24 hrs to cross country. They will blame weather but they are giving aircraft to other routes. Most worthless customer service ever. Chatbot will provide platitudes,,,,,
" My son's connecting flight got delayed by 2 hours not including the time he would already be layed over so I called and spoke to a man who was so helpful and very quick about it. I couldn't be happier with their services. Don't get me wrong, we always fly American as they have always been good to us but today went above and beyond to help us without any problems at all. Thank you American airlines.",,,,,
"  AA's plane malfunctioned and caused a half-hour delay, causing us to miss our connector in Heathrow. They didn't communicate anything to us, and automatically rebooked us for a much later flight that night. They did nothing to reimburse us for our ruined first day of vacation, the missed reservations, and attempted to not even reimburse the food we had to get from the airport. They jerked us around for over a month before answering one of our complaints, and then toyed with us for over a month before blocking further communication with us. Do. Not. Fly. American.",,,,,
"  This is the worst experience. I paid good money to have aisle seats and because our flight was canceled for no known reason, we were bumped to middle seats. I did not pick middle seats for a reason. I paid to have aisle seats and should gave had seats changed to the exact same choice. I doubt I will fly American again. This is the third time we have been screwed by American. ",,,,,
"  Delayed 3 hours out of CVG, heard 3 different explanations of why, including a pilot shortage (from our pilot). Missed our layover in PHL because every American Airlines employee we spoke to refused to help us. Forced to spend the night in Philadelphia because the next plane wasn't until the morning. American Airlines refused to take responsibility for our missed flight so we had to pay for the hotel ourselves. Filed a complaint to the compensation department and they gave me a laughable $25 flight credit. I will never fly American Airlines again and I will be telling all my friends and family of my experience as well. When we asked for help making our connection, the only thing the desk agent said was ""American Airlines is aware of all connecting flights"" instead of offering any kind of help whatsoever. Missed the connection by 2 minutes because the gate was not held open or reopened for us even though the plane was still at the gate upon our arrival. Literally any assistance from anybody could have avoided this whole scenario.",,,,,
"  I booked a flight with American Airlines (first time) as it offered a good price although the operating airlines were known for their bad service. But we decided to trust American Airlines. Well, after a sudden change of plans, I called the not-so-American airlines to cancel the tickets, and was ready for penalties, etc. ... but they offered me a 12 months credit. Ok, sounds nice, United airlines does it, Air France does it. But here is the trick: the 12 months countdown starts the day of the booking. As if it wasn't enough, each ticket will be credited separately, and only the name on that ticket credited can use the credit.  I will update my review when / If we use the credit they issued to each one of us, for the onboard service quality. Till then, American Airlines should live up to the name or fold.",,,,,
"  AA 1289 was scheduled to depart JFK for BDA at 7:05 am on July 3. Some of the vacationers, many with small children, got up at 3am to catch this flight. We finally departed after 9 pm — after more than 14 hours, with no explanation, no apologies and no recompense. There were several aborted reschedulings in the interim. At one of them, the flight crew actually boarded, only to deplane 20 minutes later. They explained to the anxious crowd around the podium that there was a maintenance problem with the auxiliary power unit. So, during one of the busiest travel times of the year, at one of AA’s principal hubs, they didn’t have the wherewithal — parts and/or expertise — to make this repair. In other words, this terrible experience was 100% due to AA’s incompetence. Meanwhile, we got closer and closer in time to predicted, severe thunderstorms, raising the suspicion that AA was hoping nature would let them off the hook for canceling the flight. Finally, AA put us on substitute equipment, 3 hours after it arrived from CLT. I’ve been flying AA for 50 years and have 1.6 million miles. This was the worst customer service fiasco in that span.",,,,,
"  I was originally booked to fly out on 7/7/23. I had paid for main cabin tickets, as well as for a seat with extra leg room, complementary alcohol, and a free checked bag (both ways). Within 24hrs I had to change my flight to the next day and was charged $57 for change in ticket price. The person I spoke with assured me the ticket change was equivalent with all the amenities I had purchased with the first ticket. At some point in time, American airlines changed my first flight to jet blue. When trying to check in for my flight tomorrow, I discovered that I was downgraded to coach and now have to pay again for extra leg room and I have to pay $30 to check a bag. Essentially I paid for something I am now not getting. This is simply unacceptable. I may never fly American again.",,,,,
"  Worst flight experience to date. Flight kept getting moved all over then delay for 5 hours until they pushed it to the next morning. After that everyone had to stand in line for over 2 hours to get vouchers for a hotel and food, but the food voucher could barely afford a kids meal at the hotel. Hotel was the only option for food since all of the restaurants and shops were closed. Employees were yelling at customers who have been getting the run around for over 5 hours. No one answered any questions on how to use the vouchers nor did they do anything to speed along the process of giving out the vouchers. Ended up getting the run around for so long I just booked a different flight since they weren’t really doing anything to fix the issue aside from making everyone wait even longer for a vouchers that they hardly can use. Only customer service that gets made at you for you being upset and their bad service.",,,,,
  The flight took off on time. Food was okay. Water and other cold beverages were offered several times during the flight. They also collected the trash couple of times after each service. Ice cream cup was served in the middle of the flight. Snack before arrival was so so. The seats are okay. On board entertainment - I had trouble finding something interesting to watch. This was return flight. To point out the food on outbound flight was horrible - especially the dinner- inedible mess.,,,,,
  By far the worst airline in existence. Flights are constantly delayed and customer service is a joke! If you are reading this review. I beg you to learn from series of unfortunate events and avoid this airline at all cost,,,,,
"  I purchased round-trip tickets for a vacation about 7 months in advance. Within three months, they had changed both my flight to the destination, and back home. The latter was a significant change, adding 5 hours of travel time (60% longer than originally planned) and disrupting plans both before and after the flight. I called to get a refund based on their cancellation of my original flight and putting me on an unsatisfactory alternative, and was told to file a particular form and I would get a refund on the original payment method within a couple weeks, so to just buy alternative flights that worked better. I followed these directions, but two weeks later, was told that my “refund” would be in flight credits, rather than the original payment method. This violates both their agent’s instructions AND Department of Transportation regulations. Yet, after multiple phone calls and email exchanges, I have been told that there is no possibility of receiving an actual refund. As I followed directions and immediately purchased new tickets, the flight credits are worthless to me — they essentially duped me into paying double for my tickets and are unwilling to do anything to resolve the situation. It has been a significant waste of my time, and I am furious at the lack of respect from their customer service team. I have no intention of flying American Airlines again.",,,,,
"  Bad business practices on multiple levels. I have been corresponding for months with AA over a charge dispute that occurred when I called their 800#. I have emailed all the way to the C-suite, provided pages of back up and detail, and thought the issue was resolved. I have multiple communication with the representatives from AA that ""there was no charge"". Then, when my credit card bill arrives, surprise! There is a charge. So I politely contact them again and now all of the sudden I have to deal with a third party company and not them - ""it's not their problem"". Yet, I only ever contacted AA?? And they didn't know this 3 months ago? Bait and Switch or just poor service standards? As someone in the service industry, I have made it a point to be professional in behavior and in my communications. This is not a failure on the poor representatives they have contacting me. It's a failure at the C-suite level and that is a shame. This was an easy fix and they failed.",,,,,
"  Total disrespect from staff at B7 around 11:45 p.m. July 2, 2023, who requires additional training on how to handle customers who are frustrated due to delayed flights (we were respectful and desired the same toward us) even customers that's upset and not respectful as a customer service rep no one/she don't / did not have the right to be disrespectful, get smart/sarcastic. We just wanted an additional room and I knew it was possible, as much money as American Airlines make. She also said due to our reservations was made together, this was the reason we were given only 1 room. She needs additional training or termination if this is repeated actions of hers which should not be tolerated in her field of service! AA did at least, after we were assisted by a nice manager named Liz and another gentleman that was with her, we did eventually received free taxi/ shuttle service to a nice Hilton Garden Inn facility, 2 nice clean rooms, a meal ticket (of only $12, but still was nice to receive) and we also was booked on another flight the next morning.

  I have done multiple flights from different airlines in Economy class but have I experienced this discomfort knowing it's a 13+ hours duration. This aircraft is super duper hot. It's suffocating. No cool air at all that made us feel exhausted the whole flight. Better do something about it because your endangering the health of your passengers.,,,,,
" Chicago O’Hare – Dallas Fort Worth return in Economy (Main cabin). Self Check-in in Chicago and Dallas were fast and efficient with helpful staff. Both flights were delayed, the first one 1.5 hours, the second one 20 minutes. Onboard experience was fine: FA's were friendly, cabin was clean and in a good condition. Seats in A321 were comfortable, but in 737 they felt much smaller when someone is sitting next to you. Inflight WIFI worked well with great entertainment options on your own device. There was also one free drink and snack service (cookies or pretzels) on each flight. I thought I had to pay for alcoholic drinks, but to my surprise I got a free beer. Overall I had two pleasant domestic flights except the delays.",,,,,
" American Airlines canceled the flight my wife and I were scheduled on, we sat at the ORF airport for five plus hours waiting for it, delay after delay. We were informed it was canceled due to the incoming flight crew from New York being unable to continue on with our fight due to the delays it incurred. While there getting the bad news with everyone else, we overheard a lady mention that this was the third day in a row the same American Airlines flight had been canceled on her. Due to American Airlines inability to plan ahead and swap flight crews to enable us to fly later that evening when the plane did arrive, it caused us to have to cancel our vacation entirely. When we called American Airlines directly after we were told the flight was canceled, a representative told us they could not get us on another flight to our destination within the next few days. The customer service rep did slip up and say there was another flight with seats on it the next day but the seats were marked up to $4K each and he told us he could not put us on that fight! Due to American Airlines inability to plan ahead or get us on the next flight I was not able to see my Daughter who flew out of Houston to see us, my brother and his children or my Mom and Step-Dad all of whom I have not seen for over a year. I am in the Military and nothing is more disappointing than not getting to see my family the few times a year I can, especially when it's due to an airline company failing to uphold their end of a ticket purchase! Also, due to the last-minute flight cancelation, the non-refundable costs we incurred include; TWA hotel @JFK, our portion of the destination accommodations, and Airport parking for the day we waisted sitting there. My brother also flew American weeks before and had his flight canceled on him two times before he finally made it to his destination. The customer service was horrible when we were on the phone, they did nothing to assist us and were not able to answer most of the questions we had pertaining to our cancelled flight! My advice is don't fly American unless you are prepared to have a week of delays in getting to your destination, it appears this is quickly becoming their standard operating procedure.",,,,,
"  Not just that the professional service was close to the worst. I chose This airline because of the service of the cheaper airlines, but was serviced in the worst way possible. It's also been two days and I have not yet received my luggage which is two days late. Think about this before booking your next flight with American Airlines, I know I won't.",,,,,
" Delays are ridiculous, connections are tight, and care for the customer is non existent. I missed my connection because my flight was delayed. I was told 5 times at the first airport that my connecting time was still ""legal"" because it was more than 30 minutes but my flight didn't end up landing until 12 minutes before my connection departed. I made it to the gate before they finished letting on standby passengers but they had already given away my seat and refused to let me on the plane. Then at customer service, they couldn't get me out until late the next day but, since the delay was ""weather"" related, they refused to provide me with any hotel or meal vouchers. Then, at the gate to the next flight, they made me check my bag. Keep in mind that this bag had been fine on the last flight and all of my other flights this week. Now, I'm sitting here waiting for this flight to finally depart but we're delayed again due to maintenance. I'm beginning to wonder if I'm ever going to get home.",,,,,
"  Our 1st flight was delayed, which led us to miss our connecting flight from JFK to London. We waited in the customer service line for about an hour and a half and were told that they had no flights for three days. They were also very rude to us. They did not offer any vouchers for food or accommodations (we did ask!) We were stuck in New York City with all kinds of things planned in Scotland. We called the customer service line and they were able to get us a flight the next day back to Phoenix and then to London. It took us three days to arrive to Scotland and we experienced a lot of stress and unhappiness, with absolutely no help from American Airlines. We missed a day and 1/2 of the trip we had planned for months. We also are out about $1,000 for incurred expenses. Upon returning home, I emailed to ask how to file a grievance, which is what the employee at JFK advised me to do. I have since heard from two people with no explanation of how to do this. The only thing that they sent is a $25 trip the credit for two of us. I’m completely insulted and flabbergasted by their lack of customer service and I will not be flying American Airlines again.",,,,,
"  Many passengers on my flight missed their connecting flight due to delays. We were delayed at least 40 minutes taking off. Several passengers in front of me knew as we waited to taxi to the gate they had already missed their connection. The pilot and staff were great. The issue is simple to me. Flights that don't run within 15 min early/late run a huge risk of causing passengers to miss connections. The pilot was transparent in tell us they were assigned to a gate, which was occupied. Then assigned to another gate. Which was also occupied. So we waited on the ground about 20 minutes for an open gate. Don't airports have like 900 gates? I find it ludicrous that the delay was made even worse by the inability of the airport. Charlotte to find a gate. I have a layover, so I won't miss a flight. I guess this review is on behalf of my passengers missing connecting flights, the ludicrous flight connection system, and the entire system itself. I don't want excuses about pilot shortages, luggage handler shortages, import vibration, etc. For $550 for a flight from PA to AL, figure it out.",,,,,
"  Absolutely incompetent flight coordinator and grounds crew management! Last three times to Austin Airport, we sat on the tarmac for 30min waiting for a gate. Then we have to wait an hour + for our baggage claim",,,,,
  I really to thank you Deborah Martin from American Airlines LA for a great assistance she gave to a friend and I. We got out flight changed at the last minute while we was waiting to do the check in. It was changed for the next day and she fixed it putting us in the next flight getting to the destination at the same time. We really appreciate. Thank you again!,,,,,
"  Worst flight experience I’ve had in a very long time and I have had years where I flew over 50 flights. Missed connection coming in to DFW, misled by flight crew, no gate agents would speak to me, had to get in the only customer service line which was hours long, my luggage arrived nearly 24 hours after I did when I got to my final destination. Captain actually came back and asked us if we had seen anyone loading luggage and then shrugged. What a mess. Gate crews were rude and unconcerned. Will never fly American Airlines again.",,,,,
" Twice, delayed flights, plans ruined because can't make connecting fought to destination. They don't give a damn. Done with them. Recommend you choose another carrier.",,,,,
"  We flew from Jacksonville to Baltimore. Flight was delayed and I had to make another flight. We stayed at airport over nine hours. Now we are trying to fly back home to Jacksonville and this flight is delayed. Never again will fly such an incompetent airline. So trying to cancel trip in Sept, ticket is non refundable",,,,,
"  Terrible. My family and I were forced to check our bags even though there was plenty of room in the overhead compartments for our carry ons, and our carry ons were within the size limit for the compartments. Once at the baggage claim, all of our bags eventually came out except for mine. We headed into the customer relations office to ask if they knew where my bag was, and the woman’s response was, “We’ve been waiting for you to come in here.” They then proceeded to show me that my bag had been completely shredded, and several items inside had been shredded as well. It was very obvious that they were not planning on going out of their way to show me my damaged bag or make up for the damages. I’m very disappointed with the customer service and the lack of awareness in today’s world. I will not be flying with American again.",,,,,
"  Worst experience ever. Flight delayed then cancelled. Offered hotel voucher but one person for a line as big an aircraft capacity. Five people were helped in 2 hours. Then we got cards that says we're closed and she left. Voucher for food was $12. A hamburger is $25. Doesn't matter, they were all closed. Then delay to another gate to delayed again. We had the plane from last night. They said we could leave are bags on board. So we have a plane with no crew or pilot. Every AA employee was pretty rude and wouldn't do anything for you. I'm cancelling my AA credit card because I don't want to use American airlines ever again.",,,,,
"  Flight 703 CLT to BUF was diverted to PIT on Sunday, 25 June 2023, for valid reasons. Stuff happens. Vouchers were given for a hotel and for food. A voucher was promised for travel to hotels that did not have a shuttle service. The travel confirmation texted to my phone contained a link to american-airlines-passengers.tvlinc.com/. The page to which the link led provided a registration code for the hotel and a voucher for $12 for food. In the middle of the page, it said, ""No shuttle: Transport voucher will be available after hotel is booked."" No vouchers were given at the gate in the airport. No voucher was given by the hotel. No voucher appeared in my American Airlines app. No voucher was offered today as I checked back in for the flight to BUF. We were told that all we had to do was to contact aa.com/refunds to file a claim for the travel to and from the hotel. 1. There is no option on aa.com/refunds to ask for transportation to and from the hotel. 2. A link in the support page asks whether the user would like to chat with support, but the page to which the link leads has no portal to a chat system. I do not think American Airlines is competent enough to be lying. They just do not know what they are doing. Stuff happens, but some stuff that happens is contemptible. I pass over the hour wait in PIT for a storage container to be delivered to the pantry. That is a whole other level of incompetence that just added ire to the fire.",,,,,
" Our mission trip to Africa was cancelled due to travel in vain. The airline failed to get us to our destination, it is as simple as that. There were 23 of us traveling together, all leaving from Albuquerque. Our American Airlines connection in Dallas was delayed so we missed our connecting Qatar flight which then spiralled into a nightmare of trying to get our flights rebooked for 48 hours. We were told that our tickets were booked and that our luggage would only go where our tickets specify (by multiple agents from Qatar and American) only to find out when we went to check in that our flights had not been rebooked, and later that our luggage was not remotely attached to our tickets (but halfway around the country or world without us). The nightmare we went through trying to get American and Qatar to talk to each other to make sure our flights were actually booked was an unacceptable fiasco that no paying customer should ever have to go through. We went back and forth between the two counters dozens of times only to find out each time that their systems would not work with each other. This ultimately ended in our trip having to be cancelled because the airlines could not get all 23 passengers on a flight to our destination before the gate closed. The lack of efficiency was only second to the lack of care and empathy on the Airline's part. The customer service we experienced from American throughout this process was abysmal- agents literally laughed at a hopeless mother of six who had been stranded for two days because of their system's incompetence. We did everything in our power to ensure that we were working within the system requirements, being diligent to double or triple check things (even though that is not our job) and get to the airport 5-6 hours early to be safe. None of it mattered. In the end the Airlines failed miserably to treat us like respected customers or even with basic human decency. Because of this disaster and being stuck in Dallas for nearly 72 hours we incurred thousands of dollars in expenses (hotel rooms, Uber rides, food deliveries). We hold American responsible for this nightmare, though Qatar played their part as well. If they had not closed the gate on 23 people 30 seconds before we walked up to the gate (and refused to reopen it) none of this would have ever happened. But it did happen, and now we need to be reimbursed for this horrific disaster. ",,,,,
"  This is by far the worst flying experience I’ve ever had the displeasure of experiencing. The staff were unhelpful, rude, and just gave wrong directions, our gate changed a total of five times and looping back to our original gate, it took two hours to even get a crew on board the plane, and when we were finally seated and ready to go, they had to refuel the plane! Our flight was supposed to leave at 4 pm, but it left at 9:20pm. I never wish to fly with this horrible airline for as long as I live. Awful experience.",,,,,
"  They failed to take off on time resulting in being late to the next 2 flights, then they had the audacity to tell my wife the she will be stuck in Charlotte for the night and they will not be providing a room for her because the flight was delayed due to weather issues. The only reason i even bought the tickets where because it was last minute and there were no other options.",,,,,
"  Good service generally but three major complaints. Because Limited business class space, had to fly economy. After two legs in business class (Johannesburg, Dubai, Miami) this represented huge challenges with luggage, which cost a fortune. Did nobody foresee this disconnect? Loyalty program is a total con - none of benefits (priority boarding, first bag free) materialized. So why bother? Blatant profiling at boarding, clearly rules apply only to certain passengers",,,,,
"  As someone who travels frequently, this was the first time I encountered a staff that didn't know how to smile or appear willing to help. This issue was not limited to a single staff member; the next desk had the same attitude. Since this was a work trip, my colleagues also had the same impression about the whole crew. It's not just about their lack of willingness to work; it's also the attitude that made me feel like I was doing something wrong or that I was an unvalued person who didn't deserve good service. I was not going to write a review but they forced me to do this with things that happened afterward. My bag has not arrived with me. Their staff assured me that my bag would be sent directly to Porto. Trusting their words, I didn't even think about tracking my bag during my 5-hour layover in Lisbon. Why would I? I have learned that my baggage was not even checked into Lisbon airport. Consequently, when I arrived in Porto, I had to wait a long time for my bag. I notified the lost bag department and missed my paid train home. I was exhausted and disappointed, not knowing what to do without my presentation materials. They called me whoever I was talking to (Stacey) was the only good thing about this airline. She was nice. I spent around 60 euros because of them. (paid ticket, presentation materials, clothes etc.) However, the other airline companies I know generally pay compensation right away. Here, they are asking you to fill out a form to claim your money.  It is well designed for you to give up and not be able to fill out the form to claim your money. In any way, the time I lost, the frustration I had for a couple of days. These were all enough for me to never ever use this company. This was my first experience with American Airlines, and I am sorry that it turned out this way.",,,,,
"  Wishes I could give it a zero. I had to make a connection in Dallas from New Orleans to San Diego but the first flight was delayed so I had to change the second flight to the latest one. The first flight was delayed 3 times until suddenly we’re informed it’s cancelled. The app automatically canceled my second flight so I had to rebook both. I eventually could take another flight to Dallas (which was delayed too) while the last flight to San Diego was still boarding (delayed by an hour as well). However since my flight (with a reserved seat) was cancelled and no seat available, I had to stay at the airport. There’s a long long line waiting at the customer assistance and the line was almost not moving in more than an hou. The staff appeared not caring and helpful, not sure what they’re doing behind the computers. Will never book their flights again.",,,,,
" Miami airport is the worst I've seen. Few charging stations, delayed flights a million times, canceled flights with very little staff to help rebook. Nasty restrooms and changed gates a million times. You have to walk for miles for each gate. After changing my gate and flights a few times, they sent my suitcase to Tampa Florida which was my original connecting flight to get Dallas. It was supposed to me 3 hours and ended up having to go to Las Vegas to Dallas for 8 hours with my 10 year old. She was exhausted and so was I. We got home at 8 with no bag until 10. I slept for 1 hour and had to go back to get suitcase. ",,,,,
  Use another airline. This airline is horrible and don’t help at all. My flight was scheduled for June 21st to departure at 1:14pm to arrive in Dallas at 4:49pm to connecting flight to MCO. I spent all day in the airport from 10 something in the morning until 5ish when they decided to stop delaying it and just canceling it. I spoke to two different reps with American Airlines and one said it was a maintenance issue that caused the delayed another one said there was no crew availability. They think that because they arranged accommodations and meal vouchers would be okay! No that’s not okay! Who is going to pay me for all of us who had to work and I have school. It’s a total of 6 including a minor. The agent at MLM moved our flight for 9:30am the next morning just to find out later last night it had been moved to 4:47pm. This is ridiculous every agent or rep I speak with do absolutely nothing! They blame the airport and the airport blame Dallas airport. This has been a total nightmare. This will be the last time I ever use them. Oh and to top it off they sent me an email giving me a $50 trip credit! You think that’s okay? NWho’s going to pay our day missed at work the extra days at the parking garage for our vehicle? American Airlines don’t care!,,,,,
"  American Airlines had an almost 14 hour delay because of mechanical issues that they knew about the night before the flight. Despite this, after waiting 7 hours at the airport, I booked another flight as I had to be at my destination the same day. It cost almost double to fly on another airline. Instead of compensating me for the extra expense, American has offered only $25 in credit, less than $1 per hour of my delay. I have never experienced terrible customer service like this before. Be aware that if there are issues, American will leave you high and dry.",,,,,
  I just had my worst experience ever flying courtesy of American Airlines. I booked a round-trip and I lost a day stranded in the airport to go to my destination because American Airlines delayed my flight and now I'm stranded in Miami until Wednesday because American Airlines just canceled my Monday flight at the last minute and they just left me to my luck.,,,,,
"  I usually fly American, however this is the 3rd time my flight has been delayed. In a row, causing me to miss my connecting flights, all 3 times. Then, I was rebooked on flights the next day. Unacceptable, especially when I'm on a tight schedule. I'll be changing airlines for future flights until things get back up to standard.",,,,,
  Picture this: your flight is delayed for a reroute flight plan but eventually takes off 30 mins later only to land 3 hours later at an unscheduled airport causing you and your wheelchair assist family to miss an international connecting flight and now you are stranded. You cannot rebook your flight using the app as it still says “delayed” 3 hours later. You are directed to call an speak to an agent which is a 3.5 hour long wait while your connecting flight has already landed! You are not offered even a beverage. You cannot receive your luggage in order drive to the next airport. And your family cannot receive any updates from the staff who are now mutes. But you have paid upfront all of the required fees and taxes for every single facet of these flights. And somehow the courtesy of communication was not included in that cost. Take your business elsewhere. It would be easier to just walk.,,,,,
" I recently had a highly disappointing experience with American Airlines' code share partnership with Japan Airlines. As a loyal customer, I had accumulated over 300,000 American Airlines points, but their redemption process left much to be desired. Despite having a substantial number of points, I was unable to use them effectively or receive the benefits I expected. One of the most frustrating aspects of my journey was no seat selection options, particularly when traveling with children. It is unfathomable that an airline of American Airlines' stature would not prioritize the comfort and convenience of families. With no control over seat assignments, we were left scrambling to find suitable seats, causing unnecessary stress and discomfort. Adding to my disappointment, there were no options to upgrade, even when I was willing to pay for an upgrade. This lack of flexibility was particularly disheartening considering the length of my journey. Traveling from the USA to Vietnam with a layover in Japan for over 9 hours meant that comfort and quality service were crucial. Unfortunately, American Airlines/Japan Airline failed to deliver on these fronts. To make matters worse, the return trip mirrored the same problems. The absence of reliable customer support was particularly frustrating. There was no one to turn to for assistance or to address our concerns. This lack of accountability and communication left me feeling abandoned and unsupported throughout my entire journey. Furthermore, both of my flights experienced delays during boarding. This additional inconvenience only served to exacerbate an already frustrating experience, leaving me questioning the airline's commitment to punctuality and customer satisfaction. In light of this disappointing experience, I am left wondering about the value of retaining my American Airlines points or why anyone would choose to remain loyal to the airline. The inability to utilize my points effectively and the overall lack of customer-centric services have seriously diminished my trust in American Airlines. I sincerely hope that American Airlines takes these concerns seriously and addresses the numerous issues faced by their passengers. Until they demonstrate significant improvements in their services and customer support, it is difficult to recommend them or have faith in their loyalty program. Please note that this review reflects my personal experience, and others may have had different encounters. However, based on my own journey, I would caution potential travelers to consider these factors before booking a flight with American Airlines or their code share partner, Japan Airlines.",,,,,
"  American has quite simply taken the throne as the worst airline imaginable. Where do I even start? We board in Phoenix, AZ in June when it is 110 degrees outside and the plane is a literal sauna. Apparently the ac “wasn’t connected”. We then sit on the tarmac for an extra 25-30 minutes sweating profusely in the most uncomfortable situation. In the air, the outstandingly horrible display of an airline continued. I paid $40 for Wifi for the flight to watch the Us open golf tournament and in the least surprising news of the century - the wifi was broken for more than 75% of the flight. The cherry on top was the flight attendants ridiculous behavior. When asking for garbage I handed the man my sprite can and the cup. He only grabbed the can and the cup spilled on a passenger at the end of the row. They are having an exclusive discount on a Mastercard for 70,000 miles? What a joke. The attendants were loud on the speaker talking for at least 20 minutes trying to push this deal before the end of the month. Grand finale? They had interns on the flight deck at JFK and they moved the plane to far forward. We sat at the gate for 45 minutes before being able to get off the plane at 12 in the morning. If you offered me free flights for life on American I would say “no thank you” disgusting display of professionalism- worst airline imaginable. Should definitely take your business elsewhere",,,,,
"  My family and I came from a long 12 hour long flight from overseas, which was also American Airlines (went smoothly) and when we landed in Dallas it was supposed to be a short 2 hour layover before heading to Austin. Turns out the flight kept getting delayed and delayed over and over again whether it was technical issues or due to not having a pilot to operate the plane. Originally was going to depart at 6:00 pm, was now delayed to 11:50 pm. Unbelievable. Service was mediocre at best, but overall extremely chaotic and unorganized and it would have been better to have put my money in a more competent airline. We have stayed at the airport for over 7+ hours. Please put your money in a better airline, just because it’s cheap doesn’t necessarily mean it’s worth it.",,,,,
 This morning my grandmother and aunt’s digital boarding pass did not match the terminal listed on the app. The employee at DFW was rude and would not even tell my aunt if she was in the right terminal until she went back to the car to get my grandmother with a wheelchair and giant bag to check and no assistance at all. It was extremely difficult and stressful for them and they were treated with disdain. He talked to them like they were ignorant and an inconvenience. I literally cannot express how disgusted I am with the poor customer service and lack of empathy or decency that was experienced. I hope I can always find a flight on another airline and avoid yours forever.,,,,,
"  
Chaotic. Flight was first delayed an hour then the plane had broken down so we had to move planes and after being sat on the plane there was another 4 hour delay. This is very unprofessional and unorganized. This airline is terrible please never book a ticket to this airline.",,,,,
  They pushed our flight back 5 hours with no explanation and simply just a text! You definitely should spend the extra money on a better airline if possible. The staff are friendly but just overall a very unorganized airline. Do not recommend putting yourself through this chaos. No partial refund or sorry for the inconvenience. Will never fly this airline by choice again.,,,,,
  Beware - you will be treated very badly if your ever have to make a claim against this company for poor service. It makes no difference of how long you have been flying with them. Customer Service leaves a lot to be desired - following rules without any empathy or understanding of stress caused to passengers on delayed of cancelled flights. I would recommend you use another airline. My complaint was escalated but was returned to Customer Service!,,,,,
 This is the last time I spend any money with this airline. My flight was delayed almost 4 hours! The ticket agent was rude. My wheelchair never arrived at gate. I mean this place is lousy. If you must travel Avoid American Airlines at all cost. I think I'll stick with Delta Air Lines.,,,,,
" Just know that even if you book months in advance you are only buying the opportunity to fly stand by. I attempted to print out a boarding pass after checking in and their app said that could not give be a boarding pass via the app and that I should go to the ticket counter, at least 200 people in line. I finally got my pass but could not run fast enough to make the flight. I am 72. I am now sitting for 4 hours for the next flight that I may or may not get a seat in. I am feeling abused.",,,,,
"  Chaotic. Everything with them is chaotic from ticketing to arrival. Checking in is chaotic, dropping off bags chaotic. They change gates, seats, sometimes arrive early others late. From crew to ticketing agents, all rude. My flight just got confused and landed in Dulles instead of DCA.  So 1 hour late.",,,,,
"  The worst flying experience I’ve had so far. Currently writing this in the airport at 10pm after traveling since 5am so far. Delays due to weather I understand. My first flight was delayed two hours and even though I got to my connecting flight before the schedule departure time, the plane had already left. They said that we weren’t even scheduled on that flight even though we were. Their system had automatically rescheduled me without my approval because they “thought we wouldn’t make it”. When trying to get a new flight with the AA agent, she was huffing and puffing like she was annoyed with us as we were trying to find the best flight that would work for us. When we got to our second flight, there was a ground delay for another two hours. However, one of the hours was due to miscommunication with the airport staff and even though we had been ready to leave for an hour, we were waiting on staff to direct the plane who had no idea that we were ready. On my final flight to my destination there was another 45 minute delay. When the boarding time came, staff had announced that there will be another delay but they could not give us an estimated departure or arrival time. They did not even give us an explanation as to why, however another passenger later found out it was due to the crew members never arriving and no one was able to contact them. the tickets weren’t cheap and it has ended up being a waste of my money and time.",,,,,
"  Made reservations in advance, but on the day of my flight it was cancelled 3 hours before boarding. Once a reliable airline. Now it is not worth even contemplating booking a reservation with a non-productive airline. It is like going into a grocery store and finding no food on the shelves. Worthless business.",,,,,
 My flight was changed 4 times! American Airlines delayed my outgoing flight 3 times without considering the time it takes to get to the gate of the connecting flight. The 1st 2 times it was cancelled I did not get an email from customer service with the new flights.,,,,,
" Every experience with this airline is terrible, but this was an especially bad experience. As usual, the dirty, cramped cabins are uncomfortable but expensive. The flight was delayed due to over-booking flights in Denver. They claimed weather, something entirely not backed up by their own flight tracker and the National Weather Service. Naturally, this is making me miss my connecting flight. I will gladly never fly this airline again. They are simply the worst airline.",,,,,
"  American Airlines is one of the worst companies I have had experiences with that I’ve ever had. They delayed my flight to Europe, causing me to miss my connecting flight. I am understanding that things happen sometimes but the way they handled it was unacceptable. I was traveling with my entire family and small child and they totally displaced us causing a domino effect of chaos for our travels to a foreign country that we have planned for 10 years. It was very unprofessional way that they handled the situation, and they were just dumped me off to the next supervisor who would then dump me off to another supervisor. You’re unwilling to give me any type of compensation for the chaos that they created and that’s just unreasonable in my opinion and unprofessional in business. If you and your family like getting treated like trash, then I would highly recommend them but if you don’t, I would run for the hills.",,,,,
 Delayed my connecting flight and then filled my seat even though I had a seat purchased and arrived before departure. These thieves overbook then pass the problems to customers.,,,,,
" I’ve flown AA twice in 2023 and each time they have delayed my flight. There is always a connecting flight from Houston to Dallas so my connecting flight is always missed due to delay in Houston. Today, June 15, 2023, I had scheduled a 800am flight connecting to DFW which was delayed to 1000am. I was notified at 357 am of delay by text. When I get to airport the representative tells me the 800am left on time. She is not sure why they changed my flight to 1000am. I do - they bumped me off my flight. So my connecting flight in DFW will be missed because I arrive at 1140am and my connecting flight leaves at 1047 am. The DFW flight I paid for a seat which means nothing to AA. Now I’m on standby in Dallas waiting to see if I get on a 500pm or 900pm flight. AA so conveniently change your flight regardless of the fact you PAID for your flight and seat! In 2022, I was bumped off a flight 5 times in one day. AA doesn’t care.",,,,,
"  Very great experience. Will 100% fly again. Comfort was great, loved the free food and snacks. Also crew was very nice and always tried to help me whenever I needed help.",,,,,
  Before even getting on the flight the staff was rude and said we have to valet our roller bag and said they don't care if we miss our connecting flight that we have no choice and you have to deal with it. When we get to Charlotte we are instructed to wait on the right hand side of the bridge to get our bags. We do just that. We are then yelled at multiple times to move from the ground crew even though we did exactly what they instructed us to do. Needless to say they need to work on their customer service and learn how to treat passengers.,,,,,
  Honestly American Airlines has to do much better. These carriers they use for smaller cities are tiny and full to capacity. There’s barely any room to move. Why in the world when I am booking American Airlines am I being assigned this carrier? I think this information should be better disclosed to passengers when they are purchasing their flights. The plane smelt like pee and we were delayed by over 15 minutes without any explanation. It’s like an expensive bus ride to upstate NY without any damn amenities. So long as they continue to utilize this carrier for the the airport I live near to I won’t be booking any flights with with them.,,,,,
"  I want to strongly recommend the Disabled Persons Services employee, Kevin, who helped transport me across three terminals at LAX this week. He is personable, efficient, and highly competent at his job. We really needed someone like him that morning.",,,,,
" Absolute garbage. Boarded the plane only to be told to get off, Cancelled our flight and didn’t even inform us, refused to talk to customers at the kiosk, then informs us that they can’t get us to our final destination of San Francisco (one of the larges cities on the West Coast) until 36hrs after we are supposed to arrive. Lost AB&B, lost car reservation with car seat (that they aren’t going refund us for), and now we’re have to make up 2 days of travel hurrying to a wedding in Oregon, losing the time we were gonna spend driving the PCH (which is half of our trip). Please for the love of God choose a different airline.",,,,,
"  Our American Eagle Flight from SRQ to Charlotte (flt. 5521 departing SRQ at 1:30 pm on April 13) was unfortunately not wonderful. The flight attendant for business was curt, draconian in approach, and very stingy with snacks. I have flown this route numerous times and when I have asked for more than one item it was gladly given - .not the case until the entire cabin was served per the statement of this attendant, and even then, when she returned and I watched her stow the leftover snacks and I asked it was given to me with a bit of a frustrated attitude on her part. The other issue is that in prior flights on CRJ 900s, I have always been able to stow a rollaboard, which can be easily stowed above the seats the right side of this aircraft. When I asked this attendant why the policy had changed, she was rather impertinent stating that this had always been the policy by law (i.e. the need to check rollaboards). You can check your records to see how often I have flown this route from either SRQ to Charlotte or DCA and I was always allowed to bring a bag on board. I sense that my question, which was very diplomatically phrased, was not appreciated and led to the rest of our less than satisfactory interaction. I have flown American for years and prior to the pandemic was in Executive Platinum status for many of them. It is discouraging to have had a rude attendant, particularly when we paid to be in business class. It was also interesting to her how soft and welcoming her demeanor became when advertising the credit card and is associated amenities. Please understand that I don't like giving negative information nor do I wish to complain. These are challenging times for the airlines as well as passengers who fly them. But my attitude is always positive and welcoming and I expect no less than those whose service I have procured - and this was clearly substandard.",,,,,
"  Do not fly American Eagle. I flew on flight 6002 March 11,2022 from Montgomery to Charlotte. This was the worst flight ever. Their customer service is ridiculous. We landed in Spartanburg NC for a reason that no one knew. We were held on the plane for 4 hours waiting plus the 5:30am flight which was 50 minutes. The entire flight lost their connection flights and had to suffer the long day at the air port because no one knew how to connect a flight to another flight. We weren’t given any options. Nothing to help us get through. Some customers had medical Conditions that required eating before medication and nothing. As we were waiting the toilets got stuffed up and couldn’t flush any more. The seats we sat in basically had no support in the middle and sagged down the center. It was painful sitting and waiting. All in all this will be the last time I fly this airline. ",,,,,
"  Booked this round trip around 3 weeks in advance. Was rather expensive and I felt tricked into paying to reserve my seat at the time of booking. I found out subsequently that reserving was free within 24hrs of the flight. I felt it was mean of the airline to charge for 1 checked bag. I have flown many times with various European, Asian and US airlines in the past 40 years and this is the first time I have incurred these charges on top of what I believe to have been an expensive flight in the first place. The staff encountered as well as the flights themselves were no better or worse than the competition. I will try to avoid American in the future!",,,,,
  I’m on the plane as we speak making a review because the flight attendant is very rude. I’m on flight 5216 to RDU from Philly. First off let me start off with my families original flight was canceled and we had to wait 14hrs in the airport for another flight. We should of been given more than $12 food vouchers for 14 hrs. Then for us to get on a plane where the attendant has an attitude for what reason we don’t know. He asked me was I willing to help with an emergency because I have an end seat. I shook my head yes and aggressively he says you need to say yes or no. Excuse me! He could have said that a little better. Then I was looking at him and he asked me did I have a problem? Really? I have a problem because I looked at him? I just laughed and my husband said something to him and he walked away. Better customer service training needed because that’s not the way you speak to a customer. ,,,,,
" Absolutely horrible! The flight attendants were the worst! They made me wear a different mask because apparently there was something wrong with my mask, even though I passed through security and had just got off a previous plane without anybody making me switch masks! As soon as I sat down, she told the other attendant to make sure I was wearing the new mask. Then they continued to target me on the plane by telling me my pillow needs to be stored under the seat, which is a lie! No airplane carrier makes you do that. Then the older lady told me to put my phone on airplane mode as I was finishing a text. I told her to give me one second and I will put it on there, but then she yelled at me saying, “Now! Put it on airplane mode now!” So I did. Then the same lady came back a minute later to harass me again and said “I need your phone on airplane mode.” I told her that I did the first time she asked and showed her the airplane symbol on my phone. Then she got an attitude and left. I will never fly with this airline again.",,,,,

Schottenstein makes $14.7 million/yr then pays his top 5 another $21million to pick you up 6 hrs late in an outdated plane that offers no snacks, drinks, ice and only enough warm water for 1/2 the passengers, oh and no wifi. Only to leave you stranded for 17 + hrs and offer no hotel room or meal vouchers. Then pays nice people poor wages to say sorry through a smile. Tells you it's due to weather only to find out from the pilot it's mechanical. American Airlines. It's a clown show!",,,,,
"  I would not recommend ever flying this airline. The cabins are so small and they are filling every seat. The flight is packed. It seems their response to our safety during COVID is to pack the small planes where everyone but do not provide any inflight food or beverage service. I flew Delta 2 days ago, what a difference. Every other seat was open. I felt very safe from others who may have the virus and they were great at providing safe food and beverage service. I can't believe the difference in these two airlines. Especially when the price of the flights were exactly the same. I would never choose to fly American Eagle again.",,,,,
" I am usually not one to take the time to complete reviews or even the one to care about leaving a review. However this time I felt compelled. I was recently a passenger on a flight from Charlotte to New Bern, North Carolina. It had been a weekend. I was boarding the plane. With two bags strategically positioned but still somewhat awkwardly, on my person making my way to my seat. I was wearing new platform sneakers I treated myself to. It had been a year. I think we can all relate. The person in front of me stopped in his tracks to snatch up a spot to place his item in the “overhead bin”. So I had to stop mid step and took a step back. Of course, this happened to be right in front of someone of your staff sitting in one of the rows. He looked at me and said “too much to drink?” I felt instantly embarrassed. Because he wasn’t quiet and discreet. “No sir” I said. but thank you. What I wanted to say was, I did have a glass of wine prior to boarding. But thank you for assuming that I was drunk. Not that I’ve spent a last minute whirlwind weekend with my family in Massachusetts, after 14 months of not seeing them due to Covid. Not seeing my father with kidney failure for fear of bringing the pandemic to his door step, as I am a primary care nurse practitioner. It wasn’t the weight of a weekend spent desperately making up for lost time and salvaging moments. Not being exhausted staying up with him because he was too afraid to asleep. You don’t know me. I don’t know you. In a world that is already struggling. Be kind. Do not assume the worst. As much as anyone, I know the importance of safety. Ask if I am ok. Or say nothing at all. When I really wanted to answer with, if only it was that simple. I am not sure what your company has identified as core values, but where I work, these interactions would be unacceptable. Sensitivity training. Invest in it.",,,,,
  Flight departed twenty minutes late. Waited forty five minutes to park after landing because we had to wait for the one of nine gates that was occupied to depart. Ground personnel only handle one plane at a time. Obviously this airline is not concerned with even trying to be on time. First class cabin very cold. Cabin crew said they could not help because of a design flaw.,,,,,
"  Let’s start with the bad, that is terminal F and Philadelphia, it just is not a nice place, though the food court is nice! LEX is pretty pleasant however, and every single AA employee I talked to at both airports and on the flight were pretty good! My biggest issue was space. I’m 5’8, and about 175 pounds and I was cramped into the little ERJ. So, overall, a mediocre experience. Also, this flight was a Piedmont Airlines flight, operating as American Eagle!",,,,,
" American promises that they keep their planes clean, especially during COVID. The seat in front of mine was obviously filthy and had been for some time. The headrest had a layer of built up dead skin, there was popcorn on the floor, and there was a dirty water mark above my head. None of these obvious things had been cleaned in quite some time. I actually touched the seat in front of me and felt the greasy build up on the headrest. It’s unbelievable that American Airlines would lie about their cleanliness. I have pictures to prove all my claims.",,,,,
  I think the overall service of the airline was excellent. The flight was a bit pricey especially since I had a 6 hour layover for a flight from Charleston to Fayetteville. I also think due to covid the plane should be boarded from the back to the front due to space of the airplane and deboarded from front to back.,,,,,
" We boarded on time and then waited over 45 mins for a single passenger to board. The fight is only 30 mins so we sat on the airplane on with masks on for longer than the actual flight for a single passenger, turns out it was an employee in uniform. Not sure why we had to wait considering we paid for this flight and they clearly did not. Probably wouldn't be as annoyed if not sitting for hours on end with this mask on.",,,,,
 They do not care about covid at all. Packed airplane elbow to elbow and they pretend a mask will help me against the virus. No social distancing at all which is law everywhere else except airlines and Walmart apparently. Put my life at risk over a few extra dollars. Never giving them my money again unless they refund me for the complete disregard for my and the other customers health.,,,,,
"  Nashville to Charlotte. All the flight attendants was possibly the worst I’ve had in my life. Not only was they were rude, but had zero knowledge of their product, and super unprofessional. ",,,,,
" Dallas to Springfield. Initial flight time was 10:30 am, 30 minutes into the flight they decided there was something wrong with the plane so we had to return to Dallas. We were then sent to several different terminals because the workers didn’t realize there is more than one town named Springfield. Finally, after an hour or so a replacement plane arrived, they decided that the plane was also broken. Several hours later we were offered nasty stale sandwiches as an apology for their continued screw ups. We were then able to board the third plane. This plane was randomly picked for the pilots to manually figure the weight of the aircraft. Imagine my surprise when they decided the plane weighed too much. People were kicked off the plane and we had to wait an extra hour and a half to remove some fuel. This garbage airline company cost me hundreds of extra dollars (hotel, rental car, food) because I then missed the following connecting flights and had to stay the night in Missouri.",,,,,
  Charlotte to Birmingham–Shuttlesworth. PSA an American Eagle operator is killing the American brand. I have been rescheduled twice today on different flight to Birmingham because planes have maintenance issues and all they do is keep moving times out .. both have been knows for hours.. and now they are saying they don’t have the manpower to go get a new plane that is parked at another gate As a concierge key member of American Airlines I just wish the American leadership would start looking at these operators in American Eagle and cancel their contracts due to poor performance and terrible Customer experience. The worst I have seen in my 30 years of flying,,,,,
"  Monterey to Providence via Phoenix / Washington. This was the worse flight experience in my life. Hours of delays, the aircraft was old and seats falling apart. I traveled from Monterey. The plane sat for over 30 mins after boarding. No weather problems. Then there was almost four hours delay in DC. Returning home there was a three hour delay in Phoenix. The toilet lights were not working. The WiFi was working. Everything that could go wrong happened. I will never fly American airlines after my next trip. It's been booked and I can't afford to cancel. I would rate this a zero if I could.",,,,,
"  Dallas Ft Worth to Amarillo. Pretty much done flying American. Every single time it results in a cancelled flight or a delay, and American shows no sense of urgency. They do not care. Not one bit. You cannot make plans when flying American because their planes are so old and things fail when time for take off. Highly suggest using a different airline.",,,,,
 Reagan to Providence with American Eagle. Flight was consistently delayed. Gate changed 2 times. Plane changed to a smaller plane. Was not informed of the smaller plane or that those with tickets in rows not available on the new plane would get bumped. Meal voucher given was declined when I tried to use it. Was not told original flight had mechanical issues and another plane was being used which had room for some of those that were bumped until I overheard other passengers talking about it. Worst experience ever.,,,,,
" Philadelphia to Wilkes Barre. While waiting for my flight 2 other flights delayed by American Eagle for maintenance. Then it’s our turn, 10 mins before boarding and our flight also is delayed for maintenance. Sounds to me like someone should take better care of their equipment/aircraft.",,,,,
"  Had to use American Eagle to get to and from DFW to San Angelo Regional Airport and back or I never would have flown them. I've done this twice in the past year and both trips (a total of 4 flights) provided similar experiences. I have had consistently poor service (or lack thereof). The planes honestly scare me with how many obvious repairs (that don't seem particularly well done) have been done to these ancient airplanes. They seem dirty as well, though that could just be the yellowed plastic from age. The seats are hit or miss depending on how worn out the cushion is. They don't seem to have been replaced since the airplanes were manufactured (probably 20-30 years ago by the looks of them). The planes are small so if you have a standard to large carry on, it will have to be checked in. This is more FYI, since they can't really control the size of the overhead compartments (though they could buy planes made in this decade and solve this issue). The counter was supposed to have staff from 4 am - 7 pm, according to a sign on their counter. There was no one there at all. Keep in mind this small airport has 2 gates and an average of 3 flights a day. I would presume having an employee man the counters for three flights wouldn't be too much to ask, but apparently it is for American Eagle. I can't really comment on their in-flight service since, in all fairness, their flights are usually too short to be able to provide any services. However, I can comment that the pilots do not fly well, and I legitimately thought the plane had crash landed at first when the plane just dropped several meters out of the sky on landing. In the future I will just fly into DFW and drive the 3 hours to San Angelo. I will also never fly American Airlines itself again because of their partnership with this atrocious airline.",,,,,
"  By far worst flying experience ever. 2 out of four flights cancelled, and one delayed. Our plane leaving grand rapids got up to speed almost off the ground and then came to a screeching halt. The flight was then cancelled due to mechanical issues. I spoke with customer service at the 800 number, the my customer service rep was very rude to me and accused me of being rude because I was displeased my flight would have then been delayed by over 24 hours. I then took a flight the next morning that was delayed as well, and had to fly into Manchester NH over 2.5 hour drive from my home. I will never fly American Eagle again.",,,,,
  Green Bay to Chicago. Generally good service. What I hated was the strange music we were forced to listen to when we first boarded the plane. Silence would be a perfect option.,,,,,
  Providence to Chicago. First time I flew American Eagle. And it will be the last time. Delayed an hour because of a cabin defect. Overhead compartment door would not closed fully. Was fixed via duct tape. The guy had to go off to get another piece. Also their boarding process is unfriendly. ,,,,,
  I am sorry i cannot get my Eticket to load. I was on AA3533 03 August departed Chicago O'Hare airport to Madison WI. I had just an amazing flight attendant Sara. She was so friendly and kind. Peggy,,,,,
" Philadelphia to Cincinnati. The flight keeps being delayed, delayed, delayed. All the staff is offering is one excuse after another. This airline is holding us hostage. The airline has inefficient maintenance and terrible escalation procedures. Now we are being moved to the opposite end of the terminal. This is my first and last time flying this shower.",,,,,
  Philadelphia to Cincinnati. American Airlines does not respect people’s time! Or I think they don’t know the importance of time. Ok to be on point I know they always do delays but they hide it until last moment!  I think AA needs some training. Please AA improve your service and taste of cookies served on plane. Crew members are rude and so is customer assistance. ,,,,,
"  I went from Bangor to Philadelphia then to Kansas city. And the same route back. My flight was in time which was a relief because of the buses you have to take in Philly to your connecting flight. However on my way back in Kansas city they had over booked the fought by 4 people! Luckily 4 people offered to stay back because they were given 1,000 vouchers once we got to Philly they had overbooked that flight by 2 people and a seat was broken. For whatever reason, my boarding pass didn't have a seat or boarding number on it. This was extremely stressful due to the fact that there are only 2 flights a day that fly into Bangor. 3 people had to stay behind that day. How they get away with one booking. People pay money for these tickets and expect to get to and from their destination in a safe and timely manner.",,,,,
"  Beaumont to Billings via Dallas. The tickets were ridiculously expensive. The same day I booked, I had to change our flights to the next day. Even though the tickets were still same price for the next day as the ones I purchased, I was charged 150 dollars for the change. Then American Airlines pressured me into buying trip insurance, telling me that it would cover any airline changes and cancellations. As I boarded the plane going home, AA cancelled the connecting flight. When I landed in Dallas, I received text that AA re-booked connecting flight for the next day. Now they don't want to pay for the cancelled and re-booked flight (that I was unable to take & I had to rent a car to drive 6 hours home which cost me over 300 dollars). When they were pressuring me to buy the insurance, they NEVER told me the insurance only kicks in after a 12 hr delay. This delay was overnight. Meaning I originally had an evening connecting flight that was cancelled. So, my children & I were supposed to spend the night in DFW airport Isn't that why I bought trip insurance To cover the costs when this happens I know they cannot control the weather, but they could honor the insurance they pressure their customers to buy and not make ridiculous parameters that hinder customers from receiving relief from the insurance. Furthermore, ridiculous fees AA charges for changing flights (after booking the same day within a few hours) is even more reason why I love Southwest. American Airlines need to take lessons from SWA. I was very disappointed that Southwest Airlines do not fly to Billings, MT or I would have definitely flown SWA - No hidden fees, no baggage fees, no fees for changing flights, and amazing customer service!",,,,,
" Absolutely the worst customer service. Nobody is accountable for anything and has no clue of what is happening. I flew from San Jose to Los Angeles on February 11. I accidentally left my wallet on the aircraft. I got a call saying I left it and should collect it from Lost and Found the next day. When I went to LAX nobody had any clue about where it was. The lady at Lost and Found was not helpful and rude. I spent 4 hours at the airport going from counter to counter. I have a voicemail recording saying they found my wallet and then asking me to pick it up. I even spoke to someone over the phone and confirmed the same. However, in less than 12 hours they lost my wallet while getting it from the gate to lost and found. I made several attempts to reach them but nobody answered the phone. When I called the customer service number, they had no clue of how to handle this issue. I filed a report online, but they didn't even respond to that. It shows how careless the employees are with customers' property. They lost something which they themselves found! In less than 12 hours they couldn't even transport it from the gate to the lost and found department. Pathetic.",,,,,
 My brother and I had flown from Charlotte to Dulles and originally had seats towards the back of the plane. I am 6'6 and my brother is 6'4 with a prosthetic leg. Our flight attendant watched us struggle to get to our seats and cram ourselves in for the flight. He walked back and invited us to come sit in first class in 2 open seats and proceeded to make it one of the most enjoyable flights we had been on with outstanding service. We will be back to American in the future!,,,,,
  Flew Louisville to Los Angeles via Dallas Fort-Worth with American Eagle. I was in first class and didn't see any difference. It was an early morning flight and it was cold. They didn't have any blankets. The same food was offered as in the other sections. It was not first class attention at all.,,,,,
"  Knoxville to North Eleuthera via Miami. One mechanical problem followed by another, compounded by a breakdown in ground equipment caused a 5 hour delay at our origin. As a result, we missed our connection in Miami despite scheduling a 3 hour layover. This caused a 24 hour delay. As a result we miss at least one day of vacation, a day we have to pay for. The information provided while waiting on the tarmac for almost 3 hours was infrequent and unhelpful. ""Customer service"" was provided only grudgingly with every attempt made to provide minimum assistance.",,,,,
"  Salt Lake City to Los Angeles. The flight got delayed because of a lengthy De-icing process. Service was friendly for a very short flight, just drinks and snacks. Landing in LAX was very smooth and luggage delivered on time but the American Eagle terminal is uncomfortably distant from the main terminal in LAX.",,,,,
" Charlotte to Toronto. Never travel by this airline. The staff is very bad, rude and not at all friendly. We pay for our flight and in return we at least want a smile or a courtesy but do not expect it from this airline.",,,,,
"  Kansas City via Dallas Ft Worth operated by Mesa Airlines. If you're going to make your passengers slum their ride home, don't upcharge for premium seating. They wont provide even their first names for complaints and when I tried to show my receipt and what my upgrade included, the female flight attendant stormed off. I sat in 4F from MCI to DFW arrived 12/19/18 at 9:04 pm. This is the ghetto of airplanes and service. Bad form, American. I'm seriously thinking of switching to United for my weekly flights.",,,,,
"  
Nashville to Chicago. My initial flight was an hour and a half late. No reason for the delay was given. I ran through the airport to catch my connecting flight and they refused to let me board with 10 minutes to spare. The plane was still stationary and attached to the gate 25 minutes later. I asked them the soonest they could get me a flight to my destination and they replied curtly. ""4 PM, tomorrow. That's all we can do"". They had me in tears - will not be using this airline again.",,,,,
  Charlotte to Knoxville. First the flight was delayed by one hour. After we finished boarding we had to wait additional 20 for a crew to arrive from another flight. Then we arrive in Knoxville and we had to wait on tarmac for 30 mins to be taken closer to the airport. I will never fly American Airlines again. ,,,,,
"  Detroit to Chicago. The seats were super comfortable for an airplane in this size. Even this small airplane has wifi onboard. We arrived so early so we had to wait for ground service which took too long and we exited the aircraft at the exact estimated time, so we didn't loose anytime.",,,,,
"  Birmingham to Fort Smith via Dallas. Worst experience I’ve ever had. Flights cancelled due to maintenance not weather - agents aren’t being told truth to tell us -  either that or they are told to lie to us. Just tell me the truth and I can accept it. But to lie to us is unacceptable. Then no hotel - after we were told we would have a hotel at the location we were laying over in once we get there. 12:30am and we all have to fight to get them to give us a hotel like we were promised since it was a maintenance issue. Today get to airport early, flight cancelled due to maintenance, now setting on a plane waiting for fuel and a restroom that we were told doesn’t work! Now we are told another maintenance issue exists and we are delayed again!  Will never fly American again after my points are used!",,,,,
"  Toronto to New York La Guardia. Quick 1 hour flight. I found the seat on the E145 to be more comfortable than that on the Air Canada Rouge 767, which is good. Staff were very helpful, overall had a great experience.",,,,,
  Philadelphia to Myrtle beach. Sat on the tarmac while pilot told us weather was bad. Flight cancelled and returned to gate. Rebooked 24 hours later. No one offered meal or hotel. Turns out it was not weather but a technical issue. Why can airlines lie and get away with it? Don’t fly American.,,,,,
"  Mazatlan  to Dallas Ft.Worth. The plane had only 1 working bathroom which resulted in the aisle being blocked for almost the entire flight. This is unsafe and inconveniet. When I checked in, even though I paid extra for my ticket to be able to have a carry on, they made me check it. I told them I didn't want to because I had medicine in it. They told me to take the meds out and check it. Why did I pay extra for my ticket?",,,,,
"  Never fly this airline. They failed two times to tell me I was standby on the next flight and the next day also. My handicapped friend & I waited five hours to be told that. I could have booked another airline or drove to JFK for my connecting flight on British Airways. I was surprising my daughter for mother's day, flying back with her to Lebanon. Approx $1200 later I am rescheduling until Sept after driving from Michigan to Cleveland so my sister would care for my animals. Terrible, no response from them.",,,,,
" College Station to Washington via Dallas. I have flown out of College Station for six years. I have noticed a marked decline in the reliability and on-time performance of the American Eagle flights in the past year or so. I have flown four times in the past couple of months, and each time the flight was delayed at least an hour. Today I scheduled a connection with an extra hour of connection time, but it is not enough. I am going to miss the connection. I fly internationally quite often and have given up trying to fly American Eagle for those trips, because missing the connection is not something you can recover from. The thing I hate the most is the way they say, delayed 20 minutes. Then delayed an hour. Then delayed an hour and 10 minutes. Then delayed two hours. etc. If the delay were at least estimated with a little more accuracy, then a person could make plans. The problem is that the planes are so ancient that there are constant maintenance problems. This airline, like nearly all US carriers, is a mess. It is just terrible. If I had any choice at all about travel, I would not fly American Airlines, but in my town there are very limited options. Unfortunately American Eagle does not give a darn about its quality of service. The ground crew in CLL just shrugs their shoulders. Not their fault.",,,,,
 Louisville to Dallas. We arrived at the airport at 416pm because our flight was set to leave at 635 PM. The boarding pass at first was not confirmed at the ticket desk. The staff had to go get a supervisor. He said she could not find it because my flight had been changed to depart at 8pm. Instead of gate 29 we were now 49. We walked to 49. I looked at my phone and at 417pm and got an alert starting the flight would be late. I was already at the ticket desk by then. Then after sitting for two hours next to gate 49 they announced my flight gate had changed to 1. I have a fused foot and if my daughter had not been with me I would not have made that walk with my luggage in time. I will never fly American Airlines or its affiliates ever again.,,,,,
"  After the 50 passengers were cramped into the shuttle bus, we were told the pilot requested mechanics to deal with a technical issue and we would have to wait a ""couple of minutes"". 10 min later, with doors closed it was hard to breath. The driver cranked the AC to full blast and opened the doors and now we were freezing. After 30 min standing in a cold, packed bus, we were told we would go back to the terminal. Another 10 min later the issue was solved by an off duty mechanic, and we were lucky to be on our way. In short, it was disrespectful, and a health hazard experience.",,,,,
"  This was a top to bottom terrible experience with American Eagle. I usually fly Delta and now know why. This flight was booked for me for business. Generally unfriendly service especially by gate staff that either seem inexperienced or poorly trained. 1 to 1.5 hour delays on O'Hare-Wichita both ways, with a 20 min wait on tarmac at O'Hare from CVG due to no boarding tunnel driver. 3 gate changes at O'Hare within 45 min. Late arrival, arrived at hotel after mignight for AM talk. Coming home, was reassured connection would be no problem, then progressive delays and missed connection. Was told by attendant there would be customer service agent to rebook and arrange hotel, but there was none. Gate staff was grumpy and blithely said no hotel because was weather delay, then I asked her to confirm, she reluctantly called and confirmed it was mechanical. Took 15 min to get hotel voucher 30 min away and told could call for shuttle, called hotel and they said no shuttle and airline ""always does that"". Returned to gate and another 15 for cab voucher, still had to cover tip. Hotel at midnight, rebooked for 8am flight. Meal voucher $7 did not cover meal at airport. Flight itself was average enough, arrived safely. Given option, would not travel on American again.",,,,,
  Albany to Chicago. This plane is clean and attendants pleasant. But I'm upset with the fact I couldn't pick a seat and I am assigned the last seat 18 that does recline. I have a health issues where I would have never chosen this seat. This plane is small and cramped. For where I'm destined I could have picked my usual airline but was suggested by the IT company that is flying me out to pick this one or another airline. I am sadly disappointed. If I can avoid this airline in the future I will. Seat comfort is zero. The lower part of the back indents in so I am hunched forward in this seat that can't recline.,,,,,
"  Monroe to Dallas Ft Worth. I have never in my adult life had the flight attendants be so lazy. They were nice, but when it was time for beverages, they not only left out the part where they tell you what they have, by they requested that everyone keep their order to one drink per person (it came off rude). Then the gal walked through with a box holing the snacks and just put it in front of each passanger to get their own snack and then they came through with the drink cart, once my snack was already almost gone. And then why I was surprised, but they came over the speaker to tell everybody to put their shades down, before we landed, so the plane wouldn't get hot. Never have I ever felt like the flight attendants hated their jobs and were lazy. ",,,,,
"  Chicago to Toronto, they allowed overbooking - resulted in finding volunteers in current flight to move to next flight and resulted in delaying. I was very surprised by the fact that they allowed overbooking, and they had to find 4 volunteers to move to the next flight. The crew member mentioned that the current flight will not be going anywhere until they find volunteers to move to the next flight. Is this a joke? It's a simple math that if the flight is full, they should not take any more customers, but it happened. Not only this delayed the departure time, they provided no compensation whatsoever for people who waited to meet their schedule; this is outrageous. They are ruthless when it comes to customers being late to board on the flight, and if it's other way around, they want our patience - very frustrating. Another problem was that the flight landed in Cleveland to fuel their gas. This was very upsetting because this implies that they did not fully fuel their gas to get to Toronto. I can't stop myself thinking that they can't do math. This delayed another 2 hours or so, and we finally landed to Toronto at 5:00 pm, instead of 2:31 pm. I have nothing more to say about this airplane other than it's stupid and lazy. Only good thing to talk about is that the flight crew lady on the plane was very nice and tried her best to keep us calm. She needs a raise for covering others' problems.",,,,,
"  Montreal to New York JFK. Please be aware before buying a ticket with this airline, check their punctuality!. This particular flight seems to be almost always delayed by close to 90 minutes. I found out through checking Flightstats that this flight (and apparently many more) in the last 12 consecutive days: - 9 of 12 days has been delayed for more than 90 minutes (up to 184 minutes) - 2 of 12 days was cancelled and only on ONE day out of 12 days actually arrrived at the scheduled time ETA. If your travel or work schedule depends on this, choose another connection. AA does not reemburse bought tickets for their proven inability to comply with ticketed departure and arrival times. I had to buy a second ticket to leave Montreal 3 hours earlier.",,,,,
  Stewart-Newburgh to Toronto via Philadelphia. Fairly standard flights on American Eagle. The flight crew were OK (with one on PHL-YYZ being particularly friendly) and the Valet service for carry on bags works well. The wonderful thing for me was that these flights were on time (as I had tracked them for several weeks before flying and they were often late). The seats and legroom on these smaller aircraft is quite tight.,,,,,
"  We are from Australia and flew American Eagle for first time. Never again. We got on the plane in Charleston to fly to Miami after a 2 hour delay. Got to the runway and sat for 30 minutes with nobody telling us anything. Eventually pilot said the plane was too heavy and we needed to return to gate. As there was another plane already there we had to sit on the tarmac for another 20 mins. We eventually got back to the gate where they asked 8 passengers to volunteer to get off. 8 people volunteered and got off. 20 mins later they returned and they started taking fuel off the plane instead. What a shambles. Over 3 hrs late the plane took off. After complaining to American Eagle they offered us a $50 voucher valid for 12 months. I said we live in Australia it's no good to us as we won't be back here for a while. Take it our leave it they said. First time we have flown with American Eagle. Never again. They are a disaster.

  Toronto to Charlotte. Very disorganized and chaotic at the boarding gate in Toronto. Delayed 90 minutes deleting. Maintenance. No food or what're nearby (Gate A9). Nearest food/refreshment A19. On arrival 15 minute delay at arrival gate - no gate agent. Really? The inability to get the easy things causes me to question the company's ability to execute safely.,,,,,
  Los Angeles to San Francisco. I'm a platinum level member of American Airlines. I travel the SFO to LAX with return flight almost weekly. 2017 they made changes subbing out the short flights to American eagle. American eagle is already inconvenient due to the shuttle bus you have to take from the main terminals. Everything is slow and experience is unpleasant all around. So far this year 4 of 4 flights have had significant mechanical plane failures where I've been delayed up to three hours at a time. Unless AA changes these routes to normal planes in and out of terminal four at LAX they are going to lose a very valuable customer.,,,,,
"  Houston to Chicago. This was a codeshare flight with Etihad. Had a smooth checkin and courteous check in staff at IAH Houston. I lnked the aircraft as it was my first Embraer aircraft experience, just a basic aircraft with no frills and hype. 2x2 seat configuration and was served a coke and pretzels. Overall a satisfactory experience with American Eagle.",,,,,
"Ft Walton to Albany via Washington. The attitude of the person at the desk was inapproprate. The airline overbooked the flight and was asking for a person to come forward and take a later flight. Why airlines overbook I'll never know but his attitude was really nasty. He said in an annoyed voice that if no one came forward it will delay the flight and everyone would miss there connecting flight. Sounded like a threat to me and many other people. Secondly to make your connecting flight you have to be bused from the plane to a waiting area and then bused back. People wind up standing - on the bus both ways, in the waiting area etc. I fortunately had check my bag at Ft. Walton but those that did not have to get their luggage and bring it on the bus both ways. What a mess. Will never fly American again. Worst experience ever and I fly quite often!",,,,,
"Check-in was smooth. Staff nice for the most part. Seats are uncomfortable. All flights have been delayed, or cancelled. Flying back to Manchester (NH) flight was delayed and weren't able to fly back until 3 days later, staff did not handle, and we were yelled at. We decided to fly JetBlue to Boston the next day and rent a car to drive to Manchester. We didn't get a refund, or money, or credits, for staying at the airport hotel overnight, the JetBlue flight or the rental car. If you can avoid American.",,,,,
"Avoid American Eagle at all costs. I live near Roanoke and most of my flights have to go through American Eagle. I have lived in the area for 3 years and never had an on time flight with them. The last time I flew with them, they canceled my flight at boarding time ""because there weren't enough people"", and I swore them off. I had no choice today, however, and now I'm typing this from a hotel in Charlotte after my flight was delayed, then delayed again, then canceled.",,,,,
"  Flew American Eagle from Columbus to New York. There is a vast contrast between flying American Airlines mainline and American Eagle. American Eagle (AE) is to be avoided if you have any other option, especially if your route uses one of their old embraer or bombardier planes that insist on gate checking roll on bags, CRJ700, ERJ140 and ERJ145. American Airlines mainline are my airline of choice especially when flying internationally. I fly AE in and out of Columbus frequently to connect with the AA mainline international flights. I used to book Delta Connect (DC) flights on separate tickets to avoid AE but the DC schedules changed making that option impractical. As examples, with AE you have a 50/50 chance of arriving in Columbus and having to wait a couple of hundred yards back from the gate for about 10 minutes until the below wing ground handlers saunter out of their break room to marshall the aircraft onto stand. You can then wait an average of 15-20 minutes to have your gate checked bag delivered back to the jet bridge. DC normally do this in under 3 minutes for the same aircraft type. If you hold check a bag you better allow yourself a full 45 minutes before it will be delivered on the carousel. With any weather disruptions anywhere in the AA network they will delay and cancel the AE flights, especially the flights in and out of their 2nd tier bases, to the benefit of the mainline and hub flights. Then you will get a shrug of the shoulders from their staff and a statement that because it is weather related the airline bears no responsibility for any delays etc.. You will have about a 20% chance of a maintenance issue on any given flight with this older fleet. Normally it will take 20 minutes to fix the issue and then typically an hour to update the maintenance logbook before you journey can continue. It is unfortunate that the AE below wing operations are so bad as their above wing staff do appear to hustle and to be nice to the passengers.",,,,,
Phoenix to Bakersfield with American Eagle. Very quick flight 1 hour and 10 minutes. It was on time departure and arrival. Planes are the smaller ones like 25 seats. I had a aisle seat. It was fine for economy and the size of the plane. Comfortable flight. Flight attendant gave a snack and beverage service. Nice to have a service from Bakersfield to Phoenix. Both ways the plane is plenty full.,,,,,
Coming back from Phoenix to Des Moines over spring break. Tried to check in curb side (as others were already doing). No one seemed to know what was going on. We were told to go the the guy next to one lady. He sent us back to her. They were both extremely annoyed with us. Then she sent us back to him and he said his computer wasn't working to go inside and check in. There were several people outside that were able to check in except for us. They were extremely rude to us. Went inside to check in and it was compete chaos. The check in computers were not very user friendly. Everyone working seemed extremely stressed out. Finally got up to the gate and once again they were stressed out saying they were short of help. The seats on the planes both going to and coming home were the most uncomfortable seats that we have ever had to sit in. Will definitely avoid American if possible.,,,,,
"No overhead space to speak of, wonderful in-flight staff. Flight on time, and very comfortable seats. These planes are really too small for people of my stature. It is very sad what American Airlines has done to STL, with sad and disgruntled staff.",,,,,
"Flew American Eagle from Albuquerque - Los Angeles and return. I decided to pay the extra for First Class because I wanted the sole seat 2A. The seat is very comfortable and there's plenty of space. The flight crews and cabin crews were great. Very friendly and helpful. The service though is extremely basic. No food only nuts, chips and cookies. It would be nice to offer the First Class passengers some sandwiches at the very least. The tickets are very expensive and there is nothing special about the on board 'fare'. The wi-fi on board is good but it is also not complimentary, you have to pay. Again, why not offer that for free to First Class passengers? On the ground in LA I was told that I could not use the Admirals Lounge because it is not for ""First Class domestic passengers"". Again the ticket is very expensive and I don't understand why domestic First Class cannot use the lounges. Dollars per mile, I am sure that American makes more money on their domestic First Class than on their international routes. I had to extend my trip and when I changed my ticket I was charged an additional $358.00!!! Outrageous! So, my ticket ended up costing over $1,200! I will think twice about flying with American when booking my next flight. They only seem interested in making money and not customer satisfaction.",,,,,
"This is a short 30 min flight from ORD to IND, last leg of our long trip. The interior of the plane was horrible. There was no service, they said at the beginning, if we want something, call the attendants, but they will not go through the aircraft. All in all we got to the destination, but the overall experience was mediocre at best with indifferent staff.",,,,,
"Salt Lake City to Los Angeles was the worst experience among our four American Airline/American Eagle flights.  I tried to change my Frequent Flyer Number on the self-service kiosk but it didn't work, so I ask one of their check-in lady to do that when she was printing our baggage labels. But I just found out that she did not change it at all as this flight counted in my BA program rather than my CX program I ask her to change. Secondly, the flight was delayed due to technical issue. Which was all fine because people understand that it is for the sake of their lives. However, the AA maintenance in Salt Lake City was so inefficient as it took them more than 40 minutes to arrive at the aircraft and commence the problem shooting. After delayed for about 2 hours, we started to board. However that is not the end, after all passengers took their seats, we have two passengers who did not show up but the aircraft was full. Ground services and the flight attendants counted the number for more than 5 times and decided it was ok. Unfortunately there seemed to be another technical problem which held us for another 30 minutes. The total delay was more than 3 hours and the inflight experience was not good either, both lavatories were out of function shortly after beverage service. My personal opinion towards the AA domestic flight is that it depends on luck if they delay, cancel your flight or lost track of you baggage.",,,,,
"San Francisco to Los Angeles. On time and quick and efficient at check in and at the boarding gate. Great legroom because we somehow got put into the extra legroom seats. Comfy seat for the quick one hour flight down to LAX. I was shocked as an Australian there is no  proper welcome when you step onboard the plane directing you to your seat.  For takeoff and landing in Australia you must have the window shade up, but as we were coming in to land in LAX not one of the cabin crew came and asked to open the window shade. I could recline in economy during takeoff and landing. ",,,,,
"Charlotte to Coastal Carolina Regional. The flight attendant was less than desired. We had quite a few older passengers on this flight and she couldn't help them up the steps, saying I can't leave the plane. We had passengers in row 3 or 4 get sick and she couldn't get up to help them saying the crew told her to stay seated. We had passengers getting up to use the bathroom and the only time the flight attendant got up was to find a ring on the floor of the cabin between rows 3 and 4. She never made an announcement she had found the ring or anything. No beverage service, flight a little rough at times but I've had service with rougher air. ",,,,,
"We had booked a direct flight from Philadelphia, PA to Jacksonville, FL so we could spend time with our family for Thanksgiving. American Eagle diverted our flight to Washington, DC Reagan and we were made to use shuttle buses from Philadelphia to the terminal going to Reagan. The shuttle buses were dangerously overcrowded and disgusting. The plane a small 50 seat plane was completely filled. My wife and I are senior citizen and I am glad we took baby aspirin before our flight because they very tight seats caused our legs to throb. We met many individuals who complained bitterly about the seat space. Once at Reagan our connecting flight required shuttle buses to the terminal and these were overfilled. There was a mother standing with her infant trying to manage the child and stroller. There was my wife and I just trying to stand. I counted more then 70 people on a bus designed to safely carry 50. This plane held about 90 passengers and was filled to capacity. Carry ons had to be checked, because the overhead compartments were unable to accommodate the newly approved carry on luggage. The flight was a horror and took much longer then the direct flight we had booked. The plane was dirty and disgusting. For a Thanksgiving holiday American Eagle should be ashamed.",,,,,
"It is my impression that American Eagle runs a pretty good operation out of Chicago O'Hare. I must admit that although ORD was a complete mess due to a prior snowstorm, the American employees we dealt with did a great job helping us out. The flight down to Louisville from Chicago was fine, good service, arrived on time clean plane etc. The return flight to Chicago O'Hare was in the weather the entire one hour so no drinks etc. Crew did a good job. I have no complaints with this operation - using O'Hare though does tend to try ones patience - too many people. Next time I will try Nashville and drive north instead.",,,,,
"After being forced to purchase tickets via this airline for the third time I was again disappointed. 3 strikes and you get a bad review AA. First flight I had no assigned seating and flight delayed 2nd time I had my luggage missing for 24hours. Now this this 3rd time I have a delayed flight For a weekend trip that sets me back on my job and plans for my wife and I. I wish this airline would just go away, so something else could take its place. You get what you pay for here but it is not always the cheapest, so 2/10 value, Ground service - non existent in my case. Seat comfort is average for an average sized male. Cabin staff - considering how much they hate their job not bad.",,,,,
"The service was adequate, food (beef salad) was adequate. Equipment old and tired. Cabin crew friendly. However, there appears to be something jinxed about this flight. Second time in 18 months we have flown this route and both times significant delays. This time it was 90 minutes. The frustrating aspect was the number of gate changes; six of them (three of them in the last 60 minutes before departure), the same number as the last time.",,,,,
"This was my first time flying on American Eagle, and first time on a smaller ERJ175 jet. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice these planes fly. Seemed to be quieter than a Boeing 737 I am so used to flying on. It was also nice that there are only 2 seats across on both sides, and only 75 passengers. This makes embarking and disembarking much quicker. The full flight loaded in 15 minutes and left on time. Beware though, smaller plane means smaller overhead luggage bins, which means carry ons that fit easily in a 737 for example, might be a tight squeeze on this plane. I slept on the flight and missed service. There is no on board entertainment on these planes, just wifi which I did not connect to. I was in a main cabin extra seat, and honestly, I didnt notice the extra space. I am short so it really is not a factor. However, it was a benefit to be among group 1 boarding and towards the front of the plane.",,,,,
"I have flown with American Airlines / American Eagle 6 times within the past 6 months. Only one of these flights were on time, I experienced 2 cancellations and the other flights have all been delayed by 1+ hours, causing me to miss connection flights. Compensation for cancelled flights are ridiculous, either a partial refund, a flight the next day (with no complimentary hotel), or a flight to a nearby city (with no ground transportation to original city). American Eagle planes were never on time and their ground crew just don't care. ",,,,,
"Short American Eagle flight from Washington Ronald Regan to Chicago O'Hare. It wasn't perfect, the boarding gates were ""hidden"" downstairs, we were transported to the bus via bus, which was waiting definitely too long. From the other hand the plane was small, so it surely wasn't priority. Crew was okay, non-alcoholic drinks were served. Comfort was acceptable. For the price I paid (70USD) it was good value for money.",,,,,
It just goes from bad to worse with this airline. Check in for flight go to gate and assured flight is on time - shortly before flight is to leave announcement that pilot has not arrived! 10 minutes later with no announcement the flight is cancelled and mayhem ensures - cannot fault the ticketing people who did their best in a bad situation but initially suggested leave date would be 2 days from now.  I have a flight to London tomorrow night after much polite conversation eventually get on a flight tomorrow lunchtime - American is not a great airline to fly with at present! Disappointed.,,,,,
"Flight left Albuquerque on time, early morning departure. Crew was super, provided good but limited service. Arrived Dallas/Ft Worth on time. Flight was on a CRJ-900 and I was disappointed the overhead bins were so small and could not accept my downsized briefcase. It had to be checked to DFW. I was concerned the whole trip since the bag was checked and it contained all the things we want to carry with us and not check. However, the bag was delivered planeside. The service was good and I'll fly American Eagle again but will make every effort to avoid their CRJ-900 with the small overhead bins.",,,,,
"Unbelievably high quality experience from this carrier. Boarded promptly, crew very helpful in terms of getting carry on bags stowed into very small overhead bins. Can't remember the last time a flight attendant actually helped get a bag stowed instead of being critical of my efforts. Five stars to the flight attendant in first class. Flight left a few minutes early, arrived fifteen minutes early. Had a truly excellent lunch, would have been pleased to pay for it. Couldn't remember the last time that happened on a US carrier. Hope that this signals a new era at American Eagle.",,,,,
"Flew from ORD to SDF First Class, great flight quite a new aircraft too. Service was excellent and the first class seating is comfortable in a 1x2 configuration. The hour long flight departed on time with pre flight cocktails with additional cocktails and snacks offered once airborne. Crew were professional and attentive throughout the flight.",,,,,
"Excellent flight with great service provided by the cabin crew. Drinks served prior to take off, and during the flight too. The new larger aircraft on this route make a difference too for a much improved flight experience. On time departure and arrival too, which allowed a better connection for my transatlantic flight to London.",,,,,
"9/6/15, GRR-ORD, CRJ-700, First Class, seat 1A.  Booked with BA Avios Points.  Short flight to get to Chicago to connect to BA flight home.  Welcomed onboard and offered a Pre Departure Drink.  Seat was comfortable with plenty of Room. Crew were great and offered a drink and a snack on this short 30 min flight.  ",,,,,
"Terrible experience all around. Flight delayed three hours, no place to hang my dress uniform and generally terrible/confrontational service. If these people spent half the time they do berating customers actually doing their jobs correctly maybe they wouldn't have such a terrible track record with customer service. If I have a choice next time I won't fly with them, I don't even care if it costs more.",,,,,
I flew from Chicago ORD airport to Houston IAH on Monday May 25th. The flight left on time and arrived to Houston early. The flight was good because there aren't many seats onboard this plane so check in and leaving is much quicker than on normal flights.,,,,,
Without fail the American Eagle connection between DFW to Tyler or the Houston connection to Tyler is always a 3-4 hour layover. This time 30th March was the worst - went from gate B-1 to B-15 for connection and 30 minutes later I was told it was now gate 36. Caught a tram for that but after 30 minutes felt something was wrong checked monitor and found out it was back at Gate 18? Then could tell there was some confusion from those running the desk. There was a co-pilot but no pilot and flight attendant. Finally they showed up and starting boarding late then sat for a while because of some paper work problem which must have been the pilot. Then sat for a while longer. We finally took off but this is always the case catching these connections to Tyler every time. From now on I'll be driving from Dallas or Houston.,,,,,
Flew from Greensboro NC to DFW. Flight was supposed to leave around 6 pm on 9/28. After waiting until after 8 we were told the lav was not working and we would be given vouchers and fly out at 7.30 the next morning. We were not helped to find transportation to our hotel although it was late on a Sunday evening and the airport was closing down. We finally got to our hotel at 9.45. Left the next morning at 6 but didn't take off until 8.30 - were told the bathroom issues were still not fixed and we would have to land in Memphis for people who needed a bathroom break. We were forced to deplane take all our luggage off then told there were hydraulic problems. We finally left Memphis after 1 and landed at DFW after 3. The people in Greensboro were not helpful nor did we ever feel that we were given accurate information about what was going on. A miserable experience.,,,,,
For the past two years I've been flying American Eagle several times a month between St. Louis and Washington DC (DCA) and the service has steadily declined in quality and reliability. At least half of the flights are late (some several hours) and a number have been cancelled (including several evening flights requiring an overnight stay at my expense). I've tolerated this mediocre service because of convenience (and a distaste for Southwest) but yesterday upon landing at DCA the new gate arrangement has pushed me to Southwest. Now instead of boarding/deplaning at a terminal gate the aircraft parks away from the terminal and passengers are transported to the terminal - a process that takes 20-30 minute (not to mention the hassle of standing outside the aircraft on the tarmac waiting for carry-on luggage). I have also heard flight attendants and gate agents confirm the poor operations of this carrier. Fly with American Eagle at your risk.,,,,,
Was flying from Flint to Tulsa through Chicago on American Eagle. Arrived well within the check in window but the airport ticket agents were short staffed the guy who was supposed to be at the American Eagle desk was servicing United Airlines. He informed me he could help me when he was done which was 30 min after my plane took off. He blamed me for being to the counter late and when processing my new flight changed my final destination to Tuscon instead of Tulsa. Luckily I caught it before being stranded in Chicago and my bags in Tuscon. There were no additional flights that day so its back home and try again tomorrow. I will give Flint a second try but not American Eagle.,,,,,
Flight booked in Feb. for a vacation in July. We arrived early at airport and checked bags at 12.00 for a flight that was scheduled to board at 6.10 pm. Traveling with my 2 daughters. When we presented our boarding passing at 6.10 we were told the flight was overweight and we were selected to be removed. They did not ask if anyone on flight was willing to take a later flight. Just stated we were selected but not told how selection process works. Don't understand why they waited until we were ready to board. Had we been told 30 min earlier we could have caught another flight that day. They would not remove our luggage or anyone elses to make weight. We were put on a flight the next day and had a layover (purchased flight was direct) arrived at final destination a day late and very grumpy. Our luggage did make it a day earlier. Find it hard to believe that they cut it so close that the weight of 2 average people (1 of us could have gone) makes the difference on flight. I would not fly with them again.,,,,,
On June 20 2014 flew from Chicago O'Hare to Little Rock. Two hour delay because they had no flight attendant. Chicago ticket agents not friendly. On the return trip (June 23rd) no reason was given for the numerous delays of the original 4.55 pm flight. Around 5.30 we had a plane but it had mechanical problems. This went on for some time then the flight was cancelled. I booked another flight scheduled to leave around 10.15 pm but it was cancelled because the plane coming in wasn't going to get there on time. The ticket agent supervisor very unfriendly and showed no care at all of what we were going through. They did put passengers in hotels but I have family in the area. Next morning the 7.30 am flight delayed because we were told via loudspeaker by the ticket agent on duty that 'someone fell down on the job' and didn't book a crew for the right time. Crew came in about 8.45. When we landed in Chicago there was no jet bridge driver ready to let us off. Needless to say my last American Eagle flight.,,,,,
American Eagle is a poor choice of transportation and you should consider alternatives. I arrived at the airport from another flight and waited for 3 hours for my flight. Upon arriving at the airport I checked the boards to double-check that my flight would take off at the same gate as listed on my boarding pass. However when the time came my flight wasn't listed. Upon asking about the flight I was informed that they had changed gates (from B21 to B9 far from my location). However they did not announce any gate changes. I was informed that they don't announce gate changes unless it's less the change is made in the last two hours. Thus I waited 3 hours (with false information) and missed my flight. I had to stay the night in Dallas and fly standby the next morning. Why would an airline consider a policy of not announcing important gate changes?,,,,,
We got stranded at Chicago O'Hare due to a missed connecting flight because the incoming flight was 2.5 hours late. We were very tired after a full day of travel and met with stony faced unsympathetic staff at American Eagle Counter at Gate G7. After telling us we would have to spend the night waiting for the next morning flight we were given the bogus reason of weather delay and sent to AA Counter since we were told it was up to AA to handle our case. There were 2 staff personnel dealing with 2 customers and none would agree to accompany us to the AA Counter. It all ended badly with arguments the weather was nice departing in West Palm Beach FL and it was cloudy upon arrival in Chicago - nonetheless our flight came in 2 hours late. We started our day at 9pm in LAX and ended up at that time at 10pm at American Eagle Counter at ORD.,,,,,
14 April 2014. AA4223 from Chicago to St Louis. The new plane is good. 2x2 seats a line with leather seating. They know the plane is full and there won't be enough space for carry on luggage so encourage people to check in bags for free and pre-board.,,,,,
I've been stranded in Chattanooga for 2 days with another traveler trying to get to Dallas. I was given the reason of 'weather' and he was told 'mechanical' for cancellation. I will never fly American Eagle again.,,,,,
"  Pretty disappointed with ANA, especially when compared to JAL. Seats are dated and half are very exposed. The Japanese food was generally good and at times excellent. The champagne was undrinkable. The pre-flight drinks (where offered) were from plastic disposable cups. The main listed wine selection on every leg was unavailable. The crew were generally good and attentive. It is such a pity that they appear to be economising.",,,,,
"  Great service, lovely crew, comfortable seats, lots of leg room ( I am 6'2""), roomy toilets and an immaculately clean aircraft. It’s hard to imagine how a 14 hour flight in economy could be done any better. I paid in advance an extra £15 for a special Japanese meal which was most definitely worth it and really delicious, beautifully presented.",,,,,
" Overall was a good experience, check in went smoothly, food was decent for airline food and the staff was friendly. The main downside was that the lounge in Tokyo Haneda was overcrowded.",,,,,
 Paid for seats so entire family is together. Airline changes aircraft/seats and puts a stranger between us. Not even a single thought goes in this process. Extremely difficult to connect with someone on the phone. Unfortunately the competition is worse. Over the years flying changed from a fun way to travel to a dreadful experience.,,,,,
" I’m super unhappy about ANA service. They asked me and my daughter to move our luggage after we have settled down, me and my daughter are both short, but she didn’t offer her help, so that I almost dropped my luggage on one of passengers. Later during the breakfast time, she didn’t offer food to my daughter until I figured it out. My daughter is shy girl, so I had to step out and ask her to bring the breakfast to her. This kind of things have never happened to me before. I’m extremely unhappy about ANA service. ",,,,,
"  
I want to thank you to the staff of this airline as I received a great customer service. While I needed to do some ticket changes on the spot, they come ahead and helped me through very well and quickly. Without their awesome help, I would not have been Able to be on the flight. There were on delays at all also. I recommend everyone to choose this airline. Thanks.",,,,,
"  ANA provides a good value in Premium Economy. The flight attendants are top-notch. The cabin environment is comfortable, quiet, and relaxing, much different than I’ve experienced on US airlines to Japan. The seats are larger, more padded, and allow for reclining and leg support for sleeping, plus less crowded and easier bathroom access. Also, you can get two seats together for more privacy. The food was ample and delicious. If you aren’t offered the business class drinks you want, just ask and they will happily provide it (whiskey!) We purchased tickets about 5-6 months early and by the time we left, economy class seats were the same price as what we paid for premium economy. At check in we were offered a paid upgrade to business from ORD to Haneda but at $500 per person we didn’t feel it worth the money and we were pleased with our decision. I would choose ANA again.",,,,,
"  Pretty faultless. Another smooth domestic flight with ANA. Bag drop after arriving on an international flight from Singapore at Haneda was smooth and convenient. Got one of their flash sale discount fares, so was reasonable. Free Wi-Fi works well on board if you have the ANA app, but it could probably be easier to connect initially.",,,,,
" The ANA business class product is superior, and in particular the room. The food served in business class is top-notch, and the service is impeccable. I have absolutely no problem with the in-flight experience with ANA. However, their customer service is a joke. You cannot get a human being on the phone without an amount of delay. Every time I call the customer service number, of which there is only one, I am told the waiting time will exceed 60 minutes and to try again later. Today I made four calls to ANA, each time waiting between 45 minutes and one hour before either getting cut off, or getting impatient and concluding the call attempt.",,,,,
"  Enjoyed my recent flight with ANA from YVR to HND. Flight left and arrived on time. The flight attendants were very helpful, even preparing my bed when it was time to sleep. The seats are comfortable in business class and convert to a lie-flat bed. The seats on the sides are off-set with one directly at the window and the next somewhat closer in and away from the window. Seating is 1-2-1. A common complaint with the 787 is that the windows do not go completely dark as there are no shades but simply window tinting. The food and beverage service was excellent. I always select that Japanese meals with this airline and am never disappointed. The entertainment system offers a good selection of movies and of course headphones are provided. It is no surprise why ANA is and remains a 5 star Airline.",,,,,
"  Staff service remains one of the top notch across the airline industry. ANA staff are polite and attentive. Despite I'm sitting on the economy class, the crews still try their best to make sure we are comfortable from the beginning to the end of the trip. Thanks to the 2x3x2 configuration, seats are generally comfortable.",,,,,
"  Had read, and seen rumors about ANA's HND Lounges closing early due to manpower, or too many passengers in the Lounge. However was warmly greeted, and entered. Had never used the HND Lounge. Lounge was nice, and exceptional. I liked the massive glazing, so see the magnificent sunset over Japan. Announcements were made about our aircraft, not being ready on time. We boarded late. Boarding was quick. I was second to last to board. We headed out, and were served a A la Carte Sandwich. Only one round of drinks. I slept well and woke up to a second meal, with multiple drink rounds. Landed at SFO late, and proceeded through Immigration, and the Luggage Pickup. ANA staff were present there. Have been flying with ANA since 2007, have never been disappointed. Looking toward the next ANA adventure.",,,,,
"  Arrived BKK at 0615. ANA was only checking in the BKK-NRT flight. So we had to wait. Check in was fast, and efficient. I used the Miracle Lounge. Was kind of hard to find, and had to be directed by the Kris Lounge Staff to find it. Lounge was quiet, with lots of seating. Boarding commenced, and was welcomed aboard. We took off on time. Meal was served, with multiple drinks rounds. Flight had a Medical Emergency, and a announcement was made for Medical Staff to assist. Cabin Attendants came around with a drink Menu, including Champagne, Sake, and other selections. I had the Champagne. As we approached HND, I was able to see Fuji San. Landed at HND, Captain and Crew made announcements for us to please remain seated, while Emergency Personnel removed the Sick Passenger. Flying ANA on regional flights is fun, and I will continue to use them as I can.",,,,,
"  Boarding was on time but with buses, welcome was friendly and tentative. We departed on time. I had preorder Western option from menu. Appetizer and desert was Japanese style, main course was Western style. Breakfast was Japanese style, not my taste. I can understand to want to saw their travelers the Japanese style but when they order Western option, they should respect their choices. There was WiFi available on the flight and is free on Business Class. IFE was good with a good selection of movies. They offered pajamas and collected our coats.",,,,,
"  Tokyo Narita to Bangkok in Premium Economy. ANA Lounge at NRT packed, until just before 5PM. Boarded on time. Seat was extremely comfortable, and I was able to stretch out. While still parked, Cabin attendant approached me, and explained documents for entry to Thailand not required. We took off on time. Quickly I fell asleep. I woke up on descent to BKK. We landed but had to wait over 25 minutes because our gate was occupied. Landed, with ANA telling us what luggage carousel we were on. It's always a pleasure on ANA, and I look forward to the next trip.",,,,,
"  San Francisco to Tokyo Narita in Premium Economy. Had not flown with ANA since 2018, so I was excited to experience them again, and did not know what to expect. Purchased tickets in October 2022. ANA Counter as SFO fast, courteous, professional, and efficient. Was through extremely quick. United Club Lounge redone, and modernized. They didn't make announcements, so I had to pay attention for boarding. We boarded efficiently, pushed back, taxied, and took off. Cabin attendants walked around, seeing who needed entry documents for Japan. 787-9 seat comfortable, and spacious. Served a drink round, then lunch, with a second round of drinks. Browsed through IFE, but did not see anything interesting. So I Dozed off. Cabin lights were perfectly dimmed. Lights turned on, and we were served second meal. Followed by drink rounds. Landed at NRT ahead of time. Despite a 54 month absence, ANA has shown they do not miss a beat.",,,,,
"  Horrendous seats on the 787, armrest could not be removed. English skills off the crew is bad. Several instances where i had to ask three or four times to get my ordered drink without success. The only good one, was the one which was assigned originally to my side. Most annoying was that although it was already sunrise over Greenland, they shut all windows down from the galley which  confused my biorhythm (it was a dayflight). Check-In in Haneda took me 40 mins, no fast track security and the Lounge is a zoo. Asked for a shower and was told to register at a counter. I am usually the first to criticize Lufthansa for their business class but in comparison i would choose them.",,,,,
"  Just after the plane door closed on my flight from Dulles to Tokyo, I discovered that my phone was lost. It's too long a story to tell in detail, but the bottom line is that many ANA team members were involved in locating my phone in the boarding area and getting it to me in Japan just a day later - agents at Dulles, a wonderful flight attendant on board, and agents in the baggage claim area at Narita. I've always loved ANA, but seeing how their team dealt with my problem on my 6th flight to Japan has made me love them even more. I'm so grateful to ANA staff for all their help. ANA leaders should be very proud of their team.",,,,,
"  ANA should offer classes to other airlines on how to treat customers---they are so good in so many ways. First of all, economy class seats are comfortable and pretty roomy. The meals are generous, interesting and tasty. And the staff are just the best. Always giving service with a smile, they engage passengers at every turn. Japan is a country known for its good service and the crew on this flight was the embodiment of the Japanese service standard. On this flight, there was a full lunch with several dishes and then later a pretty tasty snack. Video choices are excellent and live TV is offered as well. It is a fine airline and deserves its 5-star rating.",,,,,
"  We did the flight on domestic  from Tokyo to Okinawa, about 3h with my wife and our daughter of 1.5 years old.  At platinum desk they offer to take in check in baggage, baby car and ask the team to prepare a baby cart in arrival. The lounge did have a baby play room star wars. It was great check-in is as well, well organize for family. Overall a good flight with family.",,,,,
"  I'm Japanese and the flight review was very good! The Seats were kind of uncomfortable, but the staff Service was great! It was so clean and the snacks they gave out was good. The drinks were so good too! I would recommend flying ANA to go to Japan.",,,,,
" Though ANA is a very good airline, and both the planes and lounges are great, the lack of customer service at this time is very frustrating. You simply cannot reach them by phone. I have spent countless hours trying to reach them.  Covid is just an excuse to save huge money on service. Plus, there are no walk in offices. This will be the last time I use them. If you cannot make a change, or cancel, what is the point? The website keeps showing errors. Useless.",,,,,
"  My step son flew from San Francisco to Manila via Tokyo on April 13th. Due to the covid the Philippines required a updated form and he was not able to make the flight on April 12,2022. I called ANA and the woman I spoke with was wonderful. I lost connection talking with her at 4 am the next morning. She called me back and was able to rebook my stepson on the next available flight. There was no additional charge and she was able to take care of everything. I wish I had gotten her name since she was outstanding and would like ANA to know.",,,,,
" We had booked meet and assist support for our Autistic son it was such a relief for us and him to have been supported so kindly throughout the flight process He was checked on throughout the flights, escorted to lounge and collected for boarding Brilliant care and support Thank you",,,,,
"  Check-in was easy, boarding was done by groups and worked well. FAs were very pleasant and hardworking. Unfortunately my breakfast was awful. We were kept hydrated regularly and an hour before landing,  served a tasty chicken tikka roll. The flight took an extra hour because of Philippines air traffic problems and very little information was given out by the pilot. As a result, we landed an hour late. We had to go through security at Narita which delayed things. However, ANA still managed to get my bags transferred to the United flight for which I am grateful.",,,,,
"  Can't expect much for premium economy so the seat, meal and inflight entertainment was fine. What was horrible is the policy to require mask in a 14h flight. What made it worse was the flight was midnight but the counter was only open 2 hours prior, which is normal, but made passengers unable to use lounges. What's the use of paying the additional fee? Also they only opened 2 counters for non Business. Very slow and long 1h wait",,,,,
  Very smooth check in with very generous baggage allowance. Boarding was well organized and done in zones. Cool aircraft with Star Wars robot characters talking between announcements. Service was exceptional which is something I’m used to with ANA by now.,,,,,
  The check-in and boarding were such a breeze and I really appreciate the zone system that made it even smoother. Very very generous baggage allowance for economy (2 pieces 23KG each). The airplane was comfortable and clean. ANA staff are some of the best out there so expect extreme quality of service. I was surprised that no snacks were served e but that’s not a big deal.,,,,,
"  The boarding, the seat legroom, the staff, the food, the service, the cleanness are all 10/10. The only area for improvement is the entertainment, the movie selections.",,,,,
" Would probably never recommend this airline to anyone. While their staff are nice and did tried to accommodate us, it made absolutely no sense that we are put on two separate seats again. Twice! First time, they were able to change our seats and this time they just say ""sorry it's full"". We even checked in 23 hours ahead and were unable to grab any seats together. Upsetting to have to sit next to random people.",,,,,
"  On 11/13/2022 while checking in for NH880 Sydney to Haneda, ANA employees stood and bowed to its customers, making a commitment to providing the best of service to them. While our arrival at Haneda was on time, we missed our connecting NH239 to Fukuoka due to mandated Covid testing and Immigration. The helpful ANA staff at Haneda rebooked us on ANA243 to arrive three hours later. Upon arrival at Fukuoka, ANA representative Ms. Kitazaki greeted us at our arrival gate. She advised we would have to hurry to make our connecting flight to Guam. She expedited us to the baggage claim area and advised we had two minutes to board the International Terminal shuttle. When she realized we would never get to the shuttle in time, she sprinted ahead 50 yards to delay its departure so we could board. We were the last on and because of it, we made our flight to Guam by 10 minutes. Ms. Kitazaki not only fulfilled the ANA “bowing” service commitment pledge but exceeded it. We would be honored and most grateful if ANA would recognize Ms. Kitazaki as an extraordinary team member of an outstanding airline. With appreciation. Ann and Dayton Auyong, Guam USA",,,,,
"  The aircraft and crew are safely neat! They required passengers to use sanitizer and wear mask as we entered the aircraft; clean floors including lavatory; food was very good and were using silverwares rather than disposables. Crew are helpful and kind. I saw one lady attendant , I think that was on flight NH 2 on October 18, she helped a mother with crying baby. Took the baby from the mother, she held the baby until the baby stopped crying and fell asleep, that was so sweet. Kudos to ANA for seeing caring crews!",,,,,
"  Taking ANA to Tokyo this morning, the experience is so great and definitely brighter up my trip. All air stewards are friendly, polite, caring and taking initiative to check with passengers on their needs. Nearly every hour, there is a surprise offer such as cold drink, hot drink, , breads, sweets! I am so impressed. Before I alight the flight, the stewardess who served me a yuzu drink earlier even remember me & checked with me if I like the drink .. amazing! One of the best airline I have encountered among my recent years travels. Thank you All Nippon Airways",,,,,
"  ANA All Nippon Airways is the Best. We have traveled on many airlines around the world, but the service on ANA is the very best we have ever experienced. We want to call attention to the four flight attendants Aina, Seina, Ken, and Frame who served us on flight NH849 from Tokyo to Bangkok. All the attendants were great, but these four attendants were all exceptionally professional, hard-working, polite, and attentive. We appreciate all the extras, like the real silverware, selection of movies and the pillows and blankets. (We do wish, however, that there were a vegetarian food option for my wife.) We were only flying economy, but with service like this, they make ANA economy seem like First Class! ",,,,,
"  No one enjoys a long flight, and ours was over 12 hours, but we really appreciated the quality and friendliness we found on All Nippon Airways! The food was delicious and came just when we felt a little hungry. The airplane was spotless and so well cared for, with lots of amenities even for those of us in Economy seats. The flight was flown steadily and comfortably even though there were storms in the area, and the flight attendants were amazing - professional and kind. What really impressed us though was when my mom accidentally dropped her phone on the plane. It had her ID info in it, and when they found it they sent someone all the way across the airport, through customs, to a different terminal to where where we were waiting at our next gate in order to hand deliver it to us. I wish we would’ve gotten the name of the man who brought us the phone because he even stayed around just to make sure we were taken care of since he knew our original connecting flight had been canceled. We highly recommend All Nippon Airways for the best flight experience possible. To say they go above and beyond is absolutely an understatement. Thank you!",,,,,
" Since travel to Southeast Asia has resumed under normal conditions, I purchased a Business Class RT. All the ANA personnel were very helpful in every way. Business Class were boarded in group 2. It was a very structured and quickly accomplished. Flight service was outstanding and very efficiently done. Food was quite good and well presented. Connecting flight from NRT to BKK was a 789-9. Business Class was maybe half full. Once again the flight service was outstanding. I did think the food could have been a little better amount for a 6.50 flight. We arrived 20 minutes early and very smooth immigration and customs. I changed my flight from Business Class to First Class from BKK to ORD. There was no First Class on NH808 from BKK to NRT. So, I flew Business Class and there was no food until about 1.30 before landing in NRT. Once again the flight attendants were outstanding. After arriving in NRT, I was escorted to the ANA First Class Suite lounge for the 8 next hours. Not very many people in the lounge. I was escorted to NH012 and boarded. Only 3 of us in First Class. The most outstanding flight service began. All the Flight Attendants introduced themselves. After the take-off and the meal service started. It really looked as if was going to a feast. I became quite ill and very cold. They set up my bed and gave me many blankets and I slept for about 8 hours. They constantly checked on me, which I appreciated very much. I did feel better when I woke up. We had to land in Rockford due to weather and did not get to ORD until about 6pm. I would recommend ANA Business class an First Class at any time. US airlines could learn a lot from Asian airlines.",,,,,
"  ANA boards in groups and aisle seat passengers board last, ie group 5. FAs were fantastic, attentive, polite, treated everyone well. The Premium economy cabin is laid out in a 2x4x2 seating and I was on the aisle, 26D. Be aware that C, D and H seats on the 777 have an entertainment box limiting your leg space but in because the width of the seat is wider, so it wasn't too bad but just annoying. The flight was punctual and everything ran smoothly. IFE was available and featured movies in English but had an extensive Japanese menu. There were no English TV shows, only Japanese TV serials. My food was awful. The main course was very small and very salty and not well presented.It was an odd mix of cold soba noodles, a sushi roll with edamame, a bun with butter and a salad, usually Japanese style potato salad with mayonnaise. They handed out a half sandwich halfway through the flight (egg salad) and drinks were offered regularly. The wine selection was dreadful and my sparkling wine undrinkable.  We were offered eye masks, toothbrushes and earplugs. Everyone had a pair of slippers and earphones in their seat. There was a blanket and pillow but the plane was too hot for use of the blanket. The staff responded promptly to calls and all requests and I was impressed with them. They are way better than SQ and gives SQ a run for its money. After a 2 hour wait in Narita, boarded the 787 for KUL. Again, a smooth journey, food offerings again small, salty and a confusing mix of Japanese and Western on a tray. Note that food offerings in PE is same as economy and their website says they provide PE passengers with a business class dessert but that never appeared. However, we were served Hagen Das ice cream which was welcome. I would highly recommend this airline for punctuality and attentive staff but bring some snacks and avoid their wines.",,,,,
"  I was looking forward to this flight as it would be my first time flying with ANA and heard great things about the airline. I chose and paid a little extra for Seat 30A, which turned out to be a mistake. The seat does not recline, and is up against the bulkhead. The seat is also more narrow due to the built-in tray. Most uncomfortable seat for a long flight. Disappointed that I could not upgrade my seat from Economy to Premium Economy. Crew was attentive and courteous. There were two meals served on this flight, which were average at best. ",,,,,
" KUL-NRT-IAD, Premium Economy service. There were multiple emails from ANA prior to travelling leaving instructions on what to do during travel in the Covid era. Some of these instructions are hard to follow and complicating. At KLIA, no dedicated check-in counter but joint check-in with Economy. Check-in staff were good, efficient and handled things without too many issues, lounge access at MH golden lounge which was fine. The ANA lounge at Narita was very busy and had inadequate toilets and seating areas. On boarding, no preferential boarding with PE unlike when I travelled with them 3 years ago. ANA board in groups and the boarding process in KLIA is poor with instructions from the gate staff which cannot be understood. On board, FA's were fantastic, they were attentive and proactive. No noise cancelling headphones on KL-NRT sector but they were offered on NRT-IAD flight. Where ANA falls short is in the meal service. Their meals are small in size and for a 12 hour flight between NRT-IAD, the quantity of food served is inadequate. The food is reasonable tasty but generally noting to shout home about. The cabin was kept clean throughout and toilets were immaculate. The IFA was mediocre. No TV shows, just movies. The seats are starting to show their age but they were comfortable. The leg rest was useless as it didn't offer much support and the buttons used to operate the recline and leg rest were stiff and hard to press. Overall, the flight is good value for money but catering needs to be improved.",,,,,
"  ANA continues to deliver outstanding service both on the ground and in the air. The flight attendants take care of one's every need. Very obliging and incredibly polite. My business class seat was very comfortable and allowed me to sleep for some time on this evening flight into Bangkok which takes some 7 hours. And the food is some of the best available. Unless you don't enjoy Japanese food, always select the Japanese over the Western meal. The dinner they served was one of the best I have ever had on an aircraft.",,,,,
" Before the pandemic, I flew a lot, though this was my first trip with ANA. The staff were very warm and friendly, as well as professional and courteous. I dread flying, it's something I usually like to be over with as soon as possible. However, my flight was most enjoyable and the time went by rather quickly! Though I flew in coach, I was very comfortable. Even the food, something not usually celebrated out of business class, was quite enjoyable. Your staff on this flight should be commended for their professionalism, attentiveness, and, immense friendliness. I will make ANA my go-to airline.",,,,,
"  I flew with ANA from Jakarta to Washington DC with a transit in Narita on Nov 2021. Boarding and disembarking went quite orderly, everybody waited until it's their turn, so there's no jostling at all. The flight was pleasant and the aircraft was clean and spacious enough. Cabin crew are kind and helpful. Even though the second flight was delayed due to technical problems, it was a pleasant experience. The return date on my ticket is 30 March. But I decided to return this month, in february. I called ANA customer service this morning and got Ms Hisae on the line. She was very courteous and patient with me while trying to reschedule my booking, she waited on the phone all the time when I was trying to punch in my credit card numbers to pay for the difference in taxes, which is a minimal amount. It took quite a long time for the process of rescheduling and submitting the credit card number and Ms Hisae guided me patiently through the whole process which took about an hour to complete, and she chose aisle seats for me too. Thank you so much for your kind services Ms Hisae, I really appreciate it very much. I look forward to fly ANA again on my return home this month. I'm certain the services will be as good as my outbound flight in Nov. I strongly recommend ANA for travelers to Japan or the USA.",,,,,
" We flew ANA flight NH 12 from Tokyo Narita (NRT) to Chicago O'Hare (ORD) on January 13th 2021 as part of trip home to Houston after a SE Asia Family trip. We connected to NH 12 from another ANA flight so after passing security we go directly to our boarding gate. ANA requires all passengers to keep their mask on all the time while in the airplane and while transiting except when eating or drinking. Several ANA gate attendant were making rounds checking people's documents to ensure everybody can legally enter the US. This is better than the UA process of lining everybody up in just one line and clueless on what is the requirement for entry for different countries like we experienced in SFO on our outbound trip. Boarding was announced a few minutes early. Boarding was done in groups; Business Class passengers going first then they start loading Economy from back to the front. They called by rows so there is minimum line formed at the gate, and people can social distancing while lining up. The aircraft was a 14 years old B777-300ER (JA875A) but still in good condition. The flight was quite full but boarding was done quickly. Even with the announcements on cleanings already done on the aircraft cabin, we used Clorox wipes to clean tray tables, seatbelts, armrest and screen when we got to our seat. The seat has fixed back and pivots on the upper section and slides the seat cushion forward for reclining, so there is no risk of person in front of you reclining and intruding into your space. There is footrest under the seat in front of you. Entertainment was OK but for an 11 hour trip like this more choice of movies and TV programs will be appreciated. We used our 3.5"" jack wireless transmitter and bluetooth earphones to avoid cable tangles from the provided earphones. The FAs on this flight were relatively younger than the other ANA flights we flew last few times. They are very courteous, polite and helpful, and they are cheerful when they were doing their job and their positive attitude helps passengers to relax. Rice crackers and wet towelettes were handed out with the first drink service. Afterwards we were served dinner along with another drink cart service. Dinner was either beef sukiyaki or braised seafood. I opted for sukiyaki and it was really good. Later breakfast was served and the choices are salmon flake omelette or pancakes. I chose pancakes and the pancake was good, infused with lots of syrup along with a chicken sausage. Before we land we got a tomato cheese bread snack. we were properly fed during the trip compared to American airliners. In between meals the FAs going around offering water bottles or snacks every couple hours or so. They also set up a snack and drink basket that we can help ourselves at the back galley. There were two teams of FAs and I can see them all working hard and all were very cheerful and helpful to the passengers. They were all so good that I decided to give them a box of chocolate I got from Narita during our transit. They initially refused saying this is too much for them but I told them they deserve it for their good service and to share with the other Team, and they finally obliged. We had to wait for late transferring passengers so we were around 15 minutes behind schedule, but we caught up along the way and arrived at 1.13 pm, 37 minutes early to Chicago O'Hare's Terminal 5. Deplaning was done very orderly, they called by the rows to deplane so there is no line waiting to get off the plane.",,,,,
"  Jakarta to Tokyo Narita on 13th January 2021 on the way home to Houston after a SE Asia trip. Checked in online and was able to secure bulkhead seats. Bag drop counter person worked very quick and professional, and put a priority tag on our luggage. Boarding was done in an orderly fashion, Business Class first, then Economy by row from back to front. The aircraft was a 5 year old B789 (JA875A). The seats were spacious, with footrest and leg rest, and a small tray for holding drink in between the seats, and an individual reading light. Aside from us, there is only one other person in the whole Premium Economy section. The aircraft is clean, but we still use the Clorox wipes to clean the tray table, seatbelts, armrest and the screen when we got to our seat. The tray table and screen in the bulkhead seat is folded into the seat and the touch screen is quite responsive. There is enough movies and TV series to occupy us for this 6.5 hours flight. We left 22 minutes late because we have to wait for some late passengers. But we arrived at 3:13 PM local time, a good 27 minutes ahead of schedule. FAs for this trip were very polite and courteous, and quite helpful and cheerful, a better crew set than the previous ANA flight from Tokyo 2 weeks before. We were given rice crackers, drinks and wet wipes after takeoff, then the breakfast cart start making their rounds. Choices are pancakes and white fish, and I chose the pancake. The pancake was fluffy and infused with syrup, and the accompanying chicken sausage and veggies are quite decent. The drink cart making its round again with the lunch/heavy snack before we arrived in Tokyo. Altogether this is a nice flight with ANA, and everything was going very smoothly during the trip.",,,,,
" Flew ANA Tokyo Narita - Jakarta on 31st December 2020 as part of a SE Asia Trip with family. We arrived from SFO on UA and ANA checked all transit passenger documents at their transfer counter before we are given a clearance to proceed to our respective gates. We had time to spare so we stayed at ANA Lounge prior to our departure. Boarding was very orderly and they called passengers by row starting from the back. Most of us have been seated 30 minutes before departure time but had to wait for transfer or late passengers so we were leaving around 15 minutes behind schedule. The plane was an 8 year old 788 (JA805A) but still very clean and in good condition. The seats cushion is fine and here is this net type footrest under the seat in front of you. The load is quite full (perhaps 70-80%) but the flight attendants were able to give out good service. Rice crackers snack, drinks and hand wipes were given after takeoff, and there were two other drink runs afterwards, one with supper and another one with the snack. In between the FAs went around every couple hours to offer bottled water. We got a very good supper (White fish or seafood in red sauce - I chose the seafood and it was good!) and after that a cheese tomato roll snack an hour or so before we arrived. A FA remembers when I asked for sake for dinner but she didn't have it in her cart, and she promptly return with the sake afterwards. However the crew doesn't seem to be the cheerful type. They are courteous and helpful but they are not as friendly as most ANA FAs I met in the past. As usual in a long flight I took a walk to the back of the plane and stretch in front of the restroom near the back galley, and afterwards returning to my seat through the other aisle. When I was passing the galley a FA was asking if I need anything and that I shouldn't be in the back galley area. Well I told her I was on my way back to my seat but since I'm here I'll take a cup of sake and some crackers if she don't mind. It surprises me since in most other long haul flights they always set up a snack basket and beverages in the galleys for people to take themselves and we can always cross the galley when we're walking around. This doesn't seem to be the case - or is it because of this particular route or crew, I don't know. Entertainment works well, and we used our 3.5"" jack wireless transmitter and bluetooth headphones to avoid the cable tangle. Movie selection is not too extensive but enough for this 7+ hours flight. We land in CGK at 11.26 pm or 29 minutes ahead of schedule, and deplaning was done quick and orderly. This is a good flight with ANA but I believe we may have a crew set who were not as enthusiastic or cheerful in providing service, or perhaps due to this flight being a night flight but not a redeye because they all looks kind of tired and reserved.",,,,,
"  This is the 1st time I was travelling with ANA, and you could understand why customers or aviation fans highly praise  Japanese airlines. Although the seat in this flight was not that comfortable (the model is 767); the food & beverages could help you forgotten the uncomfortable feeling of the seats. The food is really amazing; hot enough, taste delicious, and the most important thing Is that after you have your dining finished; the flight attendants will serve you drink Every 15 mins with a different beverages each time; which I have never experienced on other airlines. The attitude of the flight attendants are perfect; with smile on their face, try to help everything that they can, being professional all the time (Including the ground service as well). I strongly recommend ANA for other visitors to Japan.",,,,,
"  Manila to Vancouver via Tokyo. As part Filipino and part Japanese, I’m proud to say that the presentation of the safety video is very nostalgic and very cultural, which is what I love! The effort, cleanliness, quality and excellent service of the Japanese food and care from the flight attendants is superior!  The food tastes freshly steamed and cooked with juicy flavors from the main dish, whereas the small side dishes tastes great, plus mini ice cream for dessert! Entertainment was great too. I even like how they even set up a warning about safety concerns for turbulence impact, reminding to wear your seatbelt and PA announcements on the mini TV screen. The cleanliness in the aircraft, the space and comfortably is superb! My only concern is the room space for the leg space for the economy class in the very back seat which is connected to the wall. Either way, the seat itself with the pillows and the blankets are pretty comfortable and clean!  I highly recommend to anyone to look into ANA, their honesty about operating during a pandemic crisis like at this time is strongly recommended to those who are struggling to return to their homes. I would like to say thank you so much again for your hard work and effort and for taking us home safely during this pandemic as it’s tough to work through this crisis. This is the best airline experience I had  been through.",,,,,
"  New York to Tokyo with ANA. Unbelievably good from gate staff right through to landing. You have not experienced business class until you fly in the ""room"". Best business product out there. Food was exceptional, FAs were excellent. IFE screen state of the art, but enough movies to get you through a 14 hours flight. Highly recommended.",,,,,
"  Fukuoka to Vancouver  via Tokyo Haneda. Wonderful selection of beverages, music, movies and reading material in multiple language from a variety of genres. I appreciated the drink menu and that meal times were specifically posted in the booklet. The Kabosu aromatic water and Zange donburi were delicious. Customer Service was pleasant and cheerful while being polite. The photo I attached was from the breakfast which could have taseted better, but the quickness and practicality, with the addition that I knew exactly when it was coming showed me the preciseness of the care that was put into the planning and implementing of this service. I am sure it was easy to dispose of too which was an effective strategy, reducing the anxiety of the last couple hours significantly.",,,,,
" Narita to Perth. ANA kept us informed of their actions regarding Covid19 when it was apparent that changes would be necessary due to health and supply issues. A week prior to our flight it was stated that our route would be suspended the day after our flight. Whilst the Australian governments changed their policy daily during this period, our flight remained with on ok status. We flew last night, despite having an extremely low number of passengers. Despite enduring obvious concerns regarding their industry and their personal careers, the flight staff were friendly, helpful and professional. My admiration and gratitude are overwhelming. A great and comfortable flight and any opportunities to fly with them again will be taken happily. Japan, as usual, was hygienic and had diligent use of masks and hand sanitizer everywhere. We felt completely comfortable travelling throughout our 18-day travels, with business as usual, wherever possible.",,,,,
"  A very enjoyable flight. I flew round-trip from Tokyo to Okinawa and was surprised that even the cheapest fare on their domestic routes includes registered luggage and allows you to choose a seat for free. The cabin crew was outstanding, one of the flight attendants gave me couple of their Star Wars postcards after I'd told her my parents are big fans of the franchise. All in all, I will surely consider flying with them again if I ever find myself in Japan again.",,,,,
"  Kuala Lumpur to Los Angeles via Tokyo. The premium service I have received in ANA airline exceeded all the expectations. ANA's aircraft and staff hospitality are awesome, simply they reflects the spirit of Japanese. Thanks for ANA.",,,,,
"  ANA is the best airline I have been on. The staff are amazing the food is good for airplane food. The reason they are amazing is because the seats were nice, the cabin and bathroom clean and there were no delays at all. The safety video was in Japanese and English with subtitles in both languages. We were in economy on departure and in premium economy coming back. The seats in economy and premium economy had a foot paddle and the seat was comfortable and recline was good. The entertainment was pretty good with lots of new movies like Endgame, Spider-Man, Far from Home and Godzilla. The lounge in Tokyo Haneda welcomes business and Premium Economy passengers which lots of airlines don't do (and only welcome business class passengers) The food was good and the lounge staff were so polite. Every time you walked past them they would say “Kon ban wa”. so I highly recommend ANA. It's a great airline.",,,,,
"  Bangkok to Tokyo. So I have flown on many airlines overseas now and I will say ANA is definitely one of the best if not the best. Their customer service is great, staff are friendly, the food was good and the seats were perfectly sized for an overseas flight. They were constancy feeding you which was also really nice. I think on a 13 hour flight we got fed 3-4 times, amazing. The only thing I didn’t like if anything was that if you buy a ticket through another airline with them as partner you have no ability to prechoose your own seat or to check in online. Otherwise they are perfect.",,,,,
"  Houston to Singapore via Narita, Premium Economy seat was great. Large and very comfortable. Slept all the way back on the journey. Food was good as well, could have had fewer carbs options, more veg and protein. There was bread, rice, soba - too much carbs, in my opinion. One stewardess kept forgetting my stuff and I had to remind them or bring it to me after a couple of hours. However, I had a really good time chatting with one of the stewardess and she allowed me to stand and stretch my legs whilst waiting for my cup noodle. Inflight entertainment for English movies is limited - if you are flying short return flights, it would be ok but I was on a longer flight so I didn't have sufficient movies to keep me occupied.",,,,,
" Haneda to Kuala Lumpur with ANA All Nippon Airways. The flight into Japan was wonderful. Staff were welcoming and friendly. However, I was a little disappointed with the check in process on my outgoing flight. Once I was told of the weight limit for each baggage, I was given an extra box to move items into (which is greatly appreciated). It would be even better if the weighing scales were pointed out to passengers with the same fate as I in the future. Quite a few of their staff could not understand simple English. This also, should be improved in the future. Thanks for your service during this flight.",,,,,
"  Ho Chi Minh City to Seattle via Tokyo. After we were encouraged to book through their online website by Vietnam staff to save money, we were told by their staff in Vietnam that our infant might be over the weight limit for their child bassinet at the time of flying.  We were told that we should buy another seat for infant to be safe. After checking further their website, I found that the weight restriction for infants in the bassinet is 10 kg. I asked them to refund the tickets, to which they told me I must pay a cancellation fee. I suggested they could refund the ticket with no fee as I booked the ticket only 30 minutes ago. They refused because I booked my ticket on the website I was automatically directed to. I decided to deal with this and hope all would be ok. Finally flight day arrived, and we had no baby bassinet and our seats had been moved from our reserved seats. The agent at the check-in counted was very accommodating and did their best to block a seat for us so that my baby could lay down which was appreciated. Onboard I found the bathrooms ill equipped, my food was average, my seat seemed small, entertainment weak, and supplies seemed lacking for food and childcare. The return flights were worse, not receiving our originally reserved seats, and the staff could not make time to help with our seating arrangement which meant an unhappy babys.  I wrote a review after my first flight, and I haven't received any feedback. ",,,,,
"  Tokyo to Perth. We found the leg room was excellent. Even though take off was delayed by 30 minutes on the ground at Tokyo (due to earlier fog at Narita), the pilot managed to make up time during the 9.5 hour flight and arrive on time in Perth. We felt the food provided was not as good as it could have been. The first meal is served within 2 hours of taking off. It was a passable chicken dish with side dishes of yoghurt, salad and ice cream. The second meal is a snack and is served within 2 hours of landing. Out of Australia, the snack was fine - something like a ham and cheese croissant, but out of Tokyo the snack was an open sandwich with an inexplicable ton of mayonnaise plus vegetables (corn?), I found it horrible. The entertainment options had some recent hollywood movies to choose from - not much choice apart from that. The TV shows and documentaries were poor or non existent. ANA needs to up their game in IFE. The IFE user interface was difficult for me to use and the cabin announcements were far too quiet - I could not hear 90% of what the captain and crew announced during the flight. I probably will not fly ANA again.",,,,,
"  Los Angeles to Ho Chi Minh City via Tokyo. This is the best airline company. Everything is good. Customer service is the best. Aircrew is super good and helpful, professional. The food is the best etc.",,,,,
" Tokyo to New York. Excellent service began from check-in, with dedicated check-in room and security screening area. ANA Suite Lounge was nice, but I some how found SQ Private Room at Changi, QF First Class Lounge at SYD and the Concorde Room at JFK better. My flight was exactly the day after ANA launched its new 777 configuration to JFK, so I got stuck with the old version. However, the cabin was sparkling clean and showed no need for upgrading. My complaint was mainly about obstructed view from the Cube, and lack of storage space providing the size of the suite. Lavatory was underwhelming for first class, especially when comparing to my experience on the new SQ Suites just a week earlier. Catering was excellent, as expected from ANA. I picked the Western menu with a lot of skepticism but then was surprised about how tasty the dishes were. The wagyu steak was indeed overcooked, as anticipated on board a flight, but it was, at the same time, tender, juicy, and flavorful. ANA 777-300ER had excellent external camera, but they decided to turn it off upon landing, so I could not have a great landing view as I normally enjoyed with other airlines.",,,,,
" Tokyo to Beijing. First, the ANA lounge was very nice. There was a sushi bar but I did not try due to a long queue. The noodle bar was more than enough to keep me happy. There was no flatbed seats, but that was quite adequate for a regional flight. Service was good. In-flight meal was fine but was not as good as on ANA's long-haul flights.",,,,,
"  New York to Tokyo Narita. ANA flights depart from Terminal 7 at JFK. Check-in was quick and organized. As a business class passenger, I got access to British Airways Galleries Lounge, which had just been renovated with ample seating. The boarding process was well organized, and staff constantly apologized for the 15-minute-late departure. This gesture first seemed unnecessary, but it demonstrated a culture of discouraging lateness. The seat was not anything special, but comfortable, in both upright and bed modes. In-flight meals were exceptional, and they were easily one of the best airline meals I have ever had. Overall, ANA deserves its 5 stars.",,,,,
"  Los Angeles to Haneda was fine and service was superb. My return was not so good. After takeoff the crew started to bring out towels and rice crackers. They stopped at row 33 the row in front of me. After a short wait the crew brought out drinks and came to give us, I asked about the rice crackers, crew apologized and started bringing rice crackers and drinks. For dinner service we had a choice of Set A or Set B. We both ordered Set A, and were given 1 for my wife and I was told have a 5 minute wait,  minutes later they started with Icecream service and my wife asked about my dinner that they had forgotten. After 10 Minutes they brought to me but I refused. Every time I got up to use restroom I was asked if I wanted a drink, which I said no. ",,,,,
"  Bangkok to Houston via Tokyo. Fantastic Airline. First time flying with ANA,I was truly impressed. The check-in process (Bangkok) was fast, it took a about 5 minutes. The ground crew was courteous and helpful. The economy leg room was fine for me (5'8""). Seat was fairly comfortable. In flight service was exceptional. A snack before the first of 2 meals for a 12.5hr flight. I'm a vegan, so I elected for the fruit platter for my meals. Fruit was fresh. Plenty of restrooms available and all were spacious and clean. I've flown many Asian carries over the years and I can say this was the best, so far. I can see why ANA is rated as 5 star. I would recommend ANA to anyone. Will definitely travel with them again. ",,,,,
"  Los Angeles to Bangkok via Tokyo. Absolutely fantastic experience on this airline. My girlfriend and I flew to Bangkok, Thailand. Food was served every few hours, hot and tasty for airline food. Stewardesses were courteous, kind, and had not a single hair out of place. We were disappointed that the return flight was serviced by United. The immediate change in enthusiasm, service, and courtesy was very obvious. I highly recommend ANA to anyone traveling to Asia.",,,,,
"  I had a domestic flight from Tokyo to Sapporo on 21/09 which I'd booked months in advance. On the morning of my flight, ANA cancelled my flight because the aircraft is no longer available. I tried various contact numbers for an hour and did not get through to customer service. I had to be in Sapporo that evening so I booked with another airline which was £350 more expensive. I didn't have time to go to the airport and hope ANA would get me to Sapporo in time. I've tried to source compensation now I'm back in the U.K but ANA refuse any compensation because they say the lack of aircraft availability was due to adverse weather. This is hard to believe seeing as no other flights were cancelled, the airport was functional and I managed to fly with another airline. ",,,,,
"  
Honolulu  to Tokyo Haneda. As a traveling surfer I choose an airline that charges the least, or in most cases free (as your 2nd checked), no hassle and stress free. This Check in was a nightmare as I stood at the counter for 45 minutes because my surfboard bag was too big. Finally they accepted the bag and charged me $200 but the hassle was not worth it.",,,,,
"  I had a ticket from Nagoya to Seattle via Tokyo and I found myself staying in Tokyo longer that I had planned. I called ANA and told them that I would not be getting on the Nagoya to Tokyo flight since I was already in Tokyo, but I would still be getting on the Tokyo to Seattle flight. They said that unless I pay them 12,500 yen ($120), that I would not be allowed to get on my flight from Tokyo to Seattle. They considered that to be changing the ticket.  I was simply telling them that I was going to skip one flight but take the other.",,,,,
"  Itami to Haneda. Short domestic flight. Osaka Itami airport is under renovation, dusty and unpleasant. Check-in was smooth, domestic lounge was spartan (lunch time but no warm food), boarding was robotic, aircraft was extremely clean, with efficient and pleasant FAs serving drinks.",,,,,
"  Tokyo to London. Staff were very friendly, food was nice but only had fish left by the time they got to the back of the plane. In flight entertainment was quite limited in English for such a long flight. Seats were horrendous, the most uncomfortable. Upgrades were heavily priced. Good service all in all, and still superior choice over British Airways and other rivals flying the same route.",,,,,
"  Houston to Hong Kong via Tokyo. ANA lives up to its reputation as a 5-Star airline and it is easy to see why. I paid US$825, all-in including taxes, for a round trip journey of 3 legs in each way. HKG-NRT-IAH-LIM & back (United Airlines codeshare IAH-LIM). Incredible pricing. Even from the ground, the check-in process (Haneda) was seamless and it took us a mere 10 minutes for check-in and security and immigration combined. Despite the aircraft (B767 & B777) being of some age, their interiors were retrofitted with up-to-date IFE (with a huge selection of the latest movies, no lagging or dead screens), and USB & laptop charging ports. The widebody aircraft meant that overhead storage space was more than sufficient and nobody had any problems finding space for their bags. The legroom in economy was one of the best we had ever experienced in economy. Recline could be better. (I'm 5""11 or 1.81m and I could stretch my legs out fully), seats were fairly comfortable and I had no problems sleeping 6-7 hours at a go on the 13hr flight and this is in economy. FA service was extremely hospitable. They served 2 meals and a snack over the course of 13 hours. The meals were great and as good as what some average Japanese restaurants would serve. It is also worth noting that the checked baggage arrived with no incident. The only minor gripe, perhaps, is that the 3-4-3 configuration in economy is quite a squeeze. But still, overall, it's hard to complain at such a price point. Even in economy it's such a good experience. They deserve to be consistently at the top of world rankings in all categories. ",,,,,
"  I flew with ANA on 10/8/2019 from Taipei to Tokyo, and the in-flight service is fine and very satisfied. My scheduled return flight was on 10/12/2019, the day of Typhoon Hagibis. When Typhoon Hagibis was about to hit I got their notification by SMS that the return flight was canceled, but they didn't give further information of an alternative flight. I called my travel agent for help, they told me there is very little they can do on their side, and I have to call the ANA English call center for alternative flight arrangement. I called multiple times, but the line was busy, and finally the call was through, and I was directed to waiting for available service personnel. After 1 hour waiting my call was finally picked up , and arrange us into their 10/13 flight at the same departure time. In the next day afternoon, I got the notification again that my flight on 10/13 was canceled again.  I called the English call center again, multiple times, but I kept getting automatic Japanese audio reply which I don't understand, and couldn't get through to their service personnel.  Later, I found that their call center was down due to surged calls. Next day I went to Haneda airport when the transport services resumed, we were directed to ANA special service counters crowded with passengers. We were told the earliest flight we can took was on 10/18, that was all they were authorized to provide on the site. And we were offered the Eng call center no. which was expected to be available again in the night of 10/13, and asked us to call the center for other possibility. That is ridiculous to me, what is the point of setting up S-counters, and have customers to wait multiple hrs (>4 hrs for us), and then tell us to call a charged call center again for additional help? ",,,,,
" Tokyo to Kuala Lumpur. Decent airline but poor ticketing and check-in system. Check-in at ANA counter always takes me more than 30mins because their system indicates that the name on the check-in system and name on passport is the other way around (First name, last name). This happens even though we strictly follow ANA'S online reservation system guideline on how to input names for people from various countries. I explained this to the ground staff at Narita and Haneda multiple times but their response is usually that the reservation system is handled by another department. Discrepancy between reservation system and check in system is definitely a possibility. I can't add my miles because ANA mile systems has a totally different rule for passengers without dedicated first name and last name. So I have given up Using ANA mileage but now using United mileageplus. My family and I are relatively frequent flyers yet we never experience this with other airlines. With ANA, same problem has been going on for at least 2 yrs but we have not seen any improvement since.",,,,,
"  Narita to Kuala Lumpur on flight NH815. After arriving at my gate, I started to feel weird as we are boarding through buses. You have to climb up stairs to the plane carrying your hand luggage.  Maybe I have too high hopes for a 5 star Japanese airline. We are paying for service as a customer. ",,,,,
"  Bangkok to Tokyo Haneda. Flying with ANA is always a pleasure as even before boarding the flight you know that the service will be of a very high standard due to Japanese custom of serving the client! Hence, it was no surprise that the flight has outstanding service from the Japanese and some Thai crew. Drinks and food was served in a superb manner, plane was very clean, toilets very super clean and if or whenever you called for service the crew came immediately, spoke with the most respect and promptly served you. This is a wonderful airline which I feel even Singapore Airlines and Cathy cannot match and they are great. However, what really impressed me was how professional the Purser in charge of my section; Ms Nagakawa was! I asked a Crew member for a customer form not realising that they would consider this as me being unhappy and raise it to their Purser. Ms Nagakawa came to me and said, ""Sir, you have asked for a customer form, could you give me an outline of what the problem is?"" The way in which she did it and showed concern made me realise what high standards this airline puts in pleasing a client and if the client is unhappy in anyway, they don't speak down to the client like other airlines do, their senior team members come professionally to appease the situation and help the client enjoy their flight. Luckily for her I had good news about how wonderful the flight was. She so politely spoke to me and appreciated it but that was not just it, she continued to maintain high standards by constantly checking on me and personally serving service of a high standard. An absolutely magnificent Purser who led the team by example and I had one of the best flights of my life. My return flight too was superb with high quality service from ANA. I highly recommend this company for safety, service and most important of all the way in which you as a client are respected! Thank you to ANA for employing such wonderful staff like Ms Nagakawa and the other crew as well as setting such high standards",,,,,
"  Perth to Fukuoka via Tokyo. I would like to convey my deepest gratitude to the ANA ground staff/ supervisors in the check in desk areas at Perth International Airport. Before I could check in, I realised that I had accidentally left my mobile phone inside the car that dropped me off and I had no way of contacting them to retrieve my phone. In my distress, I turned to the first airport staff I met and they happened to be the ANA check-in supervisors. I had asked them on what I should do, whether I should check in first or try to retrieve my phone. Instead of providing me a textbook answer or redirecting me to the airport information desk, she offered for me to use her own mobile phone to call my family. I was shocked and deeply grateful. I had to make multiple calls on multiple phone numbers. But she remained She even continued to help me call my family as I checked in. They were patient, calm, and immensely helpful. In the end, I was able to retrieve my mobile phone. I am so grateful for the superb customer service. This is true service, serving with their hearts. 110% recommend. Will definitely fly ANA again! ",,,,,
" Taipei to Narita on 8/30 had a serious delay and the way ANA handling it was a mess. First of all, the ANA crew did not know anything about the problem or they knew but they did not tell us, there was no communication between the airline company and customers. All we can do was keep waiting for another delay announcement. A lot of people need to transfer at NRT so the staff let them change the tickets first, that I can totally understand. However, as a business class passenger, I should have the priority to change my flight to other Star Alliance member such as EVA Air, but there was no line for that and after 3 hours waiting in line, one of the staff said the system was closed and my flight cannot be changed. They should just tell us immediately so people did not have to wait for hours. ANA did not arrange a hotel for us, I was flying from JFK to TPE then transfer to NRT, the time I arrived at TPE was 4 am, the time I left TPE was 11 pm, 19 hours of waiting, it was a nightmare. I can assure you I am the passenger who waited for the longest hours. In this case, ANA obvious did not know when the plane can be fixed, they should just arrange a hotel for passengers instead of kept postponing boarding time without explanation.  ANA paid 15,000 yen for communication is barely enough, the taxi from the airport to my hotel was around 10,000 yen, with the tips and tax there’s not much left. At Taipei, food vouchers were not enough, foods were expensive at the airport. 200-300 Taiwanese dollars can’t even get a regular lunch set or dinner set. To sum up, this trip was a nightmare because of this incident. The most disappointing things were the way ANA deal with it. I fly ANA quite often and I always have a good impression, but from this incident, I could not believe it is a 5-star airline.",,,,,
"  Tokyo to Bangkok in July. Wheelchair passenger have to wait for check-in more than 1 hour at Haneda airport. We had been waiting at Special Assistant line for longer than 30 Minutes, then the line not move because the ladies in front of my group have some problem. All staffs come to help her. So we move from Special Assistant to normal check-in line which is faster, wait another 15 minutes and we are the next queue. ANA staff came to us and put our group back to the Special Assistant queue again. Not good service. Total process for check-in is longer than 1 hour.",,,,,
  Ho Chi Minh to to Chicago via Tokyo Narita. The Flight from Ho Chi Minh to Narita in economy was reasonable for the cost. The range of movies on the PTV system was limited and the food was very tasty. Customer service from the FAs was very excellent. The Narita-Chicago Flight was better than Ho Chi Minh to Narita because the service was better and it was flown by a B777-300ER.,,,,,
"  Okinawa to Vancouver via Tokyo. It was an amazing experience! We had to leave Okinawa because of a nearby hurricane. And our flight got delayed by an hour and we landed in Tokyo at 9:25pm and our next flight to Vancouver took off at 9:25pm. They had everything planned for our arrival and escorted us to our new flight in a rush and it was so well done. We got through one the worlds biggest airports in 25 mins and they paid for our taxi between terminals and rushed us through security and immigration, and they were keeping us updated the entire time. Got to our flight and safety took off. It was the best travel experience of my life.",,,,,
  Manila to New York via Tokyo. I am very happy with the service and cleanliness of this aircraft! ANA and the FAs are very helpful and accommodating. They are also helpful during the flight not only with my baby but other babies too. They are mindful to our needs as a family and always courteous and polite.,,,,,
" I’ve always enjoyed flying ANA on its international routes and I’m happy to report that the domestic route I flew was up to the same high standards of service. A very early red eye flight, cheap ticket but a very clean, well maintained looking interior to the aircraft. No food served but the flight attendants were very friendly and helpful without being either overly intrusive or noticeably absent. Seats were comfortable, decent enough legroom that I didn’t feel cramped on the 3 hour flight as well which was a bonus as squeezing my six foot frame into some previous airlines cabins has been torturous. No personal screens for entertainment but there were radio channels available and I always travel with a book so I was quite content. Got me where I wanted to go with no fuss and a totally uneventful journey. Thanks!",,,,,
"  Yangon to Tokyo. There was a storm in the South China Sea. You'd think that when the flight is cancelled, they'd at least shoot an email to the customers. They did nothing. We went to the airport and was informed that the flight is cancelled. To be fair they did pay decent compensations for hotel and transportation.",,,,,
 Flew ANA from Sydney to Haneda economy and Haneda to Heathrow premium economy and same reverse (premium economy was via a bid process). Flight for economy was reasonable for the cost while the premium economy wasn't as expected in that the degree of recline was less than I expected. The range of movies on the VOD system was very limited and the food was below average. Customer service from the FAs was however excellent where they were very attentive and courteous immediatly offering eye masks and ear plugs on boarding.,,,,,
  Tokyo Haneda to Sydney. Very satisfied with ANA. Their attention to detail is first class. Their service is focused on customer's safety and comfort. Professional ground and air crew. Second time to fly with ANA to Japan from Sydney and they never disappoint. The first time I was impressed and that's why I preferred to fly with them again on our second trip. As expected the service is superb.,,,,,
" So I just basically did a round trip with ANA between Washington and Tokyo. The entire crew are awesome. Very polite and ready to help. The food is extremely delicious and fresh, with obviously Japanese food focused. My only complaints are with the seat and inflight entertainment. After a couple of hours sleeping, you definitely wake up with pain in your bottom. The seating could be a little bit more comfortable. The inflight entertainment could have more movies subtitled in English, there were just a few subtitled in English. But overall speaking I'm very satisfied with ANA services, I would definitely fly again with them.",,,,,
" Frankfurt to Tokyo Haneda. Simply amazing! The CA were very professional, polite, friendly and helpful. The food was delicious and fresh.The seat was comfortable and had a recline different from other airlines (when you recline, it does not dirturb the passenger behind you). The service on board was a little bit slow but still efficient. Flight entertainment had a lot of movies in different languages, TV series, games, maps and seat to seat messaging. A very pleasant flight with ANA.",,,,,
"  Jakarta to Tokyo Haneda. Best airline experience I've had of 2019, Crew was extremely friendly, food and beverages were excellent, The IFE was nice, But one improvement, The Wi-Fi, At first I was super excited as I connected, but it did not work at all. Other than that, this airline is awesome.",,,,,
"  Jakarta to Tokyo Narita. I love ANA, is the best airline in the world. The best ANA flight attendant service and very helpful. I want to fly to Japan using All Nippon Airways again.",,,,,
"  Delhi to Seattle via Tokyo. Awesome airline! Great service and very courteous and helpful staff. The seat pitch in economy was surprisingly quite comfortable for a long distance adventure like Delhi to Seattle, which without the Tokyo halt was almost 18 hours plus of flying time and even economy class turned out to be reasonably comfortable during this long route. Channel programming was also good and there were some great Hollywood new release movies to watch from, however I would have  liked more movie content. We opted for Hindu Meal, Veg Meal and Jain Meal amongst us hoping to secure at least one good assortment in any of them. Although all of them were laid out well with fresh and high quality ingredients, unfortunately all of the lacked taste. The best amongst them was Hindu Veg Meal (if Indian food is your forte) although that too was served well but tasteless. They  need to change their Indian chefs. Apart from the let down of getting a tasteless meal, the rest of the service cannot be faulted.",,,,,
  We were scheduled to fly from Hiroshima to Narita and from Narita to LAX. Our flight was 5 minutes delayed. After we boarded the plane we were on our way to Narita Airport. However the pilot could not land The first time it was due to crowd control. The second time it was due to weather. The third time he decided to change the destination to central Tokyo airport. We landed at central Tokyo airport which was the opposite direction we were heading and had to wait on the plane for about 30 min until we could get off. The staff was trying to figure out what to do. After we were allowed off the flight we had to go to a ticket counter and make new travel arrangements. We waited in line along side every other passenger on the same flight. When we were finally attended. We were told our only option was to take a train to Haneda and from there fly to LAX. We spend the day from 8am in Hiroshima until we reached the airport at Hañeda at 1230 am. We were each given $15000 yen for travel expenses. Because we had to take a couple trains and a bullet train to make it to Haneda airport My husband and I informed the clerk that our final destination was Las Vegas we had purchased separate tickets from American Airlines to get home in Las Vegas and due to the flight change we were going to lose our flight. She booked us airline tickets to LAX and apologized about our final destination being Las Vegas. So we lost our money on those tickets. I was very disappointed with this.,,,,,
"  Los Angeles to Tokyo Narita. ANA business class FA and food was exceptionally good. Usually fly SQ for years and now will switch to ANA. Seats comfortable, nice amenities, Japanese food delicious. FA's always were personable, smiled and were genuinely willing to assist whenever needed. Flat bed can be done easily by yourself with a switch and comfortable in all positions. I was impressed with the entire experience.",,,,,
"  First time flying with this airline with my family for a trip to Tokyo and back to Manila. Have to say, economy service here is better than some business class in other airlines. Tasty Japanese food, not sure if they have other menus for other routes Very polite, trained, patient and efficient crew with little to no language barrier. Seats had pretty good space with good inflight entertainment from the regular movies, episode of series but they also have current news, sports and my favorite touch, helpful how-to act, culture videos for Japan I am trying to think any negative or inconvenience and there was really none for these flights. I guess ground crew wise, there was a couple of gate switches but when I approached the ground crew they directed me promptly. Maybe they can just improve on letting the other passengers waiting know instead of waiting for people to come to them but no worries. Overall, best airline I've tried so far.",,,,,
"  ANA has one of the best business class seats that offer a lot of privacy and comfort. Even for a tall European of 1.85m the seat is long enough to find a comfortable sleeping position. Flight attendants are outstandingly friendly and attentive without being obtrusive or robotic, and from my experience they all speak very good English. Food quality was above average, but although the flight from Tokyo to Sydney is 9.5 hours, main meal service comes on one tray with appetizer and entree served at the same time, which I find not really reasonable. I found breakfast on this route rather bland and meagre, but flight attendants are happy to find some add-ons, e.g. a left-over cheese plate or so. Inflight entertainment is generally OK, but falls behind Singapore Airlines or Qatar in terms of choice of movies or music, at least the European/Western selection, they might have a better selection for Japanese, Korean, or Chinese taste.",,,,,
"  Tokyo to Mexico City. Flight was nice, Flight Attendants were helpful although meal selections were confusing for religious. Despite any meals matter, ANA showed me that they're a real 5 Star Airline.",,,,,
" Chicago to Tokyo. The absolute best airline I’ve ever flown. If the price is close, I’ll always choose ANA in the future. Wonderful service, comfortable seat, great food, awesome lounge at Narita Airport in Japan. Can’t say enough great things about this airline.",,,,,
  Tokyo Haneda to Bangkok. I wish to put on record the wonderful service I and my son received on your flight on 31 March 2019. The flight attendants were smiling and ever helpful. So was the airport staff. Thank you and keep it up.,,,,,
"  Jakarta to Tokyo. Flight is nice, but there's a lack information about what kind of food that they serve. A confusion regarding beef/ pork, so it wasn't easy for me as religious one. Mostly I ordered Kosher Meal from website, but this time I choose to search manual by menu and a knowledge by the staff was minus. Overall, it's good flight!",,,,,
"  We bought return tickets for 2 seats. The idea was that each of our kids would sit on our laps for the whole flight. We had problems with check-in because since our seats are side by side in a 3-3-3 seat configuration,  oxygen masks that drop in an emergency is 4 per 3 seats. This means that one parent and child sharing a seat can have a mask, along with the two other customers. The solution is to move the third customer in the row of 3 seats to another available seat, or separate the parents into two different rows of the plane.  To avoid confusion at check-in, and to save them the trouble of having to shuffle customers around at the last second, we offered to purchase a third seat today for our return flight. We were declined and told we had to cancel our tickets and buy new tickets. This was poor service. As a result, we are stuck with the stress of possibly being separated for the flight back. It shows the blatant disconnect and lack of knowledge between the people you talk on the phone, and the products they offer. To clarify, they did manage to keep us together for our flight here (they had a customer in the third seat beside us.) Had we known about this over the phone when we bought the tickets, we would have bought the third seat in the first place.",,,,,
"  Vancouver to Tokyo. This is our first time flying ANA and what a delightful experience. We flew JAL last year in Economy and Business Class and it was a huge disappointment. On our flight in Economy class was 3x3x3 across in seating and we were in rows 29 and 30 GH. Even when the seat infront of us was reclined, there was still ample space and we did not feel closed in at all. The plane felt new and very clean with a fantastic entertainment selection of top run movies. I had time to watch almost 4 movies, Hollywood selection along with foreign speaking films in Korean, French, and Chinese. The cabin crew that we had was fantastic! Everyone was so friendly and helpful and made us feel like VIP unlike other airline crews that you feel did not want to help. The crew always had a smile and extremely friendly. As for our meals, we chose the hamburger salisbury with potatoes and it was delicious. It had 2 cold appetizers and both were excellent. One was like an imitation crab salad and the other an aspic with spinach. A french red or white along with a white sparkling wine were offered as well as sake. Our second meal was a tuna croissant with a yogurt and apple slices. The mini tuna croissant was also very tasty. We really enjoyed our flight on All Nippon from YVR to HND as the plane was so comfortable with great air quality and not too hot in the cabin. The seats were not all cramped together and perhaps it is because it is 3 3 3 across iso so many planes now at 3 4 3 across. We will never fly JAL ever again as it is so inferior compared to ANA. We will definitely be flying with ANA in the future.",,,,,
" I had three flights in a week with this airline, all three were delayed. Minimum delay 30 mins, maximum 1.5 hrs. Very disappointing and I mistakenly considered as Turkish Airlines via my flights agent. Never taking this airline again.",,,,,
"  Very disappointing service from the airline staff. Seats are very small and not comfortable, specially when flights for like 5 hours. There were no proper service on board. My personal opinion as compared to other low cost carrier this was my worst experience.",,,,,
" Worst trip ever. For each extra kg you pay 12 euros, if you don't have pre-ordered luggage then a 25kg will cost around 300 euros. The seats are really tight and bad, I cant even fit regularly there (190cm height). Don't recommend to anyone at all, fly with other companies",,,,,
"  Flight was delayed by an hour, no apology explanation or update, just left us waiting. Air hostess was rude for no reason. Did not have a good experience and will not use again",,,,,
  Very bad experience. We booked on Turkish Airline t0 find ourselves flying on AnadoluJet with no free luggage to check-in. So we had to pay to check-in our luggage. The staff were not helpful and not professional in dealing with customers especially the staff at the gate. The plane has no entertainment whatsoever. Not even outlet to charge mobiles.,,,,,
"  This was a very quiet flight with lots of spare seats. However I was shocked how bad the staff where towards passengers. This was by far the worst airline I’ve used and made the customer feel really uncomfortable. Staff asleep across seats and the others had no interest and  looked disinterested. This was the easy stuff to get right. Early in the flight we were given a cheese roll and a drink, but after that not even offered a drink to buy, Tea, coffee, cold drinks nothing. For a 4.5hr flight this can’t be right or even allowed.",,,,,
" My departure time was on 23.15 from SAW airport. I went to the check-in counter at around 20.30. As the counter was assigned to literally all of the AnadoluJet flights, I had to wait in the line for more than an hour and a half. When I finally reached the counter, I noticed that the staff cannot speak English effectively. In fact, they pronounced ""kg"" as ""Kee Zhee"". On top of that great experience so far, there still was a surprise awaiting me. Right at the counter, I realized that the baggage allowance for this flight is 20 Kg, not 25 Kg, and not 30 Kg. That, of course, was my own fault. My baggage was 7 Kg overweight and I was willing to pay for that extra weight. You may not believe it, but that simple process took almost an hour because it was so hard for them to accept USD instead of YTL or EUROs. Finally, after a long wait in the final passport control gate, I ran from there to the flight gate and reached there at around 23.05. But, it was not the end of that terrible experience. When I got onboard, I realized that the passengers are arranged as if there has never been a COVID 19 pandemic. Everyone was sitting in the closest possible distance from the next person and meanwhile there was no passenger in almost 1/5 of the plane. In addition to that, when I found my seat, I noticed that there is no room for my hand bag in the compartment above my head. When I asked the flight attendant for help, he, again with the most possibly basic English, responded that he cannot do anything because he does not know whose belongings are occupying the compartment. Finally, I should add that, I am from Iran and my country is not known for its high quality airlines, but even so, this was my worst flight ever.",,,,,
" I bought this flight under Turkish Airlines name and I was totally disappointed when I saw the Anadolujet sign at the check-in desk. First of all, a delay without any updates: I had to check FR24 for updates. The seat was the worst part of the flight! I had a back pain right after the flight. Catering was awful. Lots and lots of unnecessary announcements made the flight even worse! They were not letting the passengers sleep at 5am due to their long and annoying announcements. Not recommended at all.",,,,,
"  Totally fully flight, Smooth and very friendly check in, clean aircraft & Very pleasant service onboard. Flight left and arrived on time with regular pilot updates. Must mention and thank Mr Metin whom I believe to be the station manger at stansted airport for going out of his way, helping my old Mother & carrying one of our bags down the stairs as the escalator was inoperable even we did not ask for help. ",,,,,
" A low cost sister company of Turkish airlines offering domestic and international flights in the European area. The flight wasn't bad at all, service provided by the staff was friendly, attentive and correct. We received a lunch package consisting of a bottle of water, fruit juice, chocolate cake and cheese sandwich. Not bad for a budget airline. Seat pitch was incredibly tight and anyone over 1.85m won't fit in. There's no in-flight entertainment or Wi-Fi whatsoever. We arrived in time in Istanbul.",,,,,
"  A very good flight, the aircraft left a couple of minutes early but we landed 20 minutes early in Izmir, perfect. Again, like the outbound flight in the morning, a quick snack and water, coffee/tea service offered. The flight attendants were friendly and attentive. A very smooth flight. The only letdown is the high density seating, but no problem for such a short flight.",,,,,
"  Izmir to Ankara. High density seating, a little cramped, but ok for a flight lasting a little over 1 hour. The flight left on time, a quick snack, i.e. cake, given with water and tea/coffee service. The flight attendants were attentive. A smooth flight, it landed a couple of minutes early. No complaints, I would use again.",,,,,
  Istanbul to Diyarbakir. Anadolujet canceled my flight with no reason. It took more than 5 months to get my money back. There were 3 passengers in a PNR which I paid all of them by myself. They gave 3 different return codes and told me that each passenger has to go to the ticket office individually to be able to get the money back.,,,,,
  Ankara to Antalya. The plane was relatively new with a nice interior. Coffee/tea and a sandwich/cake were coplimentary on a 50m domestic flight. I was really impressed. The seat was very comfortable and the cabin crew friendly. All these for less than 20 euros with a 15kg luggage included in the price. Definitely recommended!,,,,,
" It was a connecting flight from İzmir to Ankara and Ankara to Ordu-Giresun with AnadoluJet. There was absolutely no delay. Flight was smooth like there was no transfer. Nice staff, Good coffee.",,,,,
" I have flown from Diyarbakır to Çanakkale via Ankara with one day delay because Ankara flight delayed one hour. Ground service staff was bad in giving correct information, really slow in handling passengers with transfer flights. No guidance at the airport. Accomodation was acceptable but really short (10 hours) for one day delay. One meal ticket they have provided for waiting at the airport for 12 hour was not enough. Plane was really old. Seats dirty with past eaten food crumbs. My height is 1.76 meters. Area between seats were too small for me. Sandwich and tea they gave at the flight was ok. If possible I will not choose AnadoluJet again.",,,,,
"We booked Turkish Airlines but this leg of our journey went with AnadoluJet. Worst plane I have r been in. Very little space. Everything was dirty. The passenger next to me found a used napkin in his fold up table. Flight was on time. Staff was okay, but i will try to avoid AnadoluJet.",,,,,
"I fly by AnadoluJet  8-10 times in a year. There is always at least 1 hour delay. Also don't trust their website, because on their website it shows as no delay, but at the airport there are delays. The seabus from Yenikapi/Istanbul to Bandirma will be much quicker, comfortable and cheaper than AnadoluJet. ",,,,,
Antalya-Ankara direct flights of Turkish Airlines are operated by Anadolu Jet that is a trademark of Turkish Airlines. Anadolu Jet has no Business Class Service and you are obligated to a low profile service as long as you don't transfer through Istanbul. For the CIP Lounge you have to pay an additional fee that doesn't fit with Gold Card holders. No options is a severe pain.,,,,,
TK7087 16th Feb. Flew VAN to Ankara on 737. Flight delayed due to bad weather in VAN and because 2 passengers wanted to disembark after the final door was closed (which then meant everyone had to grab their hand luggage and the overhead bins had to be checked). The flight itself was pleasant with a small snack on the short flight. The crew were very friendly too.,,,,,
Flight Antalya to Ankara flight on time pleasant air crew passenger given snacks and drinks unfortunately wanted tea but the crew did not have any milk which was disappointing as I have used Pegasus and they always have milk for tea.,,,,,
Istanbul-Stansted return by Anadolu Jet- low cost carrier of Turkish Airlines. Both flights were on time. Plane was a tired 738 but for the money I paid for ( 250 Euros) during Eid it really didn't matter. Leg space is narrow but if you get front seats you could get a few extra inches. Complimentary food and snacks were served during the flight which is a plus since low cost carriers hardly do that anymore. Crew were friendly and pilots kept us informed. No inflight entertainment but again for the value of the ticket it didn't matter that much.,,,,,
"  We had 2 flights booked and paid with this company, both flights were cancelled, we were stranded in the middle of the country with a cruise ship to catch. They would not reply to email, they have an English contact number, with messages in Spanish, absolutely useless. Took our money and got absolutely nothing. I don't agree with the rating of 1/10, should be zero like the service we received.",,,,,
  Buenos Aires to Bariloche. The airline canceled my flight without letting me know. I had paid for 4 passengers. At the check in they informed me the flight was canceled and they offered no help. I had to book last minute with another airline for over twice the cost and Andes Líneas Aéreas still have not reimbursed my money.,,,,,
"  Buenos Aires to Iguazu. Our flight was cancelled 20 minutes before departure time; no planes available! After standing in line for hours the airline just reimbursed our airfare. No other flights were offered and no hotel or food vouchers either. We were few lucky ones who flew out on another airline at $1,000 extra cost for a one hour flight. Our ticket was part of a package. I would avoid this airline at all costs in future.",,,,,
"  Tucuman to Buenos Aires. This airline is a mess. Our flight was delayed for 10 hours without notification, we were dropped at the wrong airport, and missed our hotel reservation and were forced to sleep in the airport. No accommodations were made by the airline and we were just notified that our flight back is changed again. This is unacceptable. This airline has caused people to miss reservations, wait long hours, and nothing changes.",,,,,
"I flew Ariana Afghan Airlines from Kabul to Delhi. Timing was good, but very crowded while boarding. The flight was enjoyable but no entertainment. Good and enough food provided. Very friendly and helpful staff on the flight. The ticket was very reasonable price.",,,,,
"  Our flight time was changed from 08.50am to 6pm! I missed all connecting flights, had to pay for another hotel in Abuja and was stuck in limbo. I had already checked out of the hotel. The flight change wasn't communicated and we only discovered when we got to the airport.",,,,,
"  Worst airline in Nigeria. Terrible service delivery. Insincere, bossy and lying customer service agents. Difficult to keep to schedule. Quarrelsome personnel from customer service to Air hostess. ",,,,,
  I am quite accommodating as a person and I have clear understanding of flight logistics challenges. But Arik Air showcased a complete lack of class and a blatant disregard for welfare. It’s disgraceful and outright incompetent. I arrived 55 minutes before flight time and I was unable to check in to get a boarding pass and thus forced to reschedule and it’s particularly painful because I had promised my three year old that I’d be with her. And they were so rude despite my calm demeanor. I’m not one to give bad reviews or reviews in general but here you go. I’d fly Max or Airpeace going forward and I employ others to do the same.,,,,,
"  The shuttle bus dropped us the passengers at the hanger! The flight from Lagos to Port Harcourt was scheduled at 3pm then rescheduled to 6pm, then again moved to 8.30 and I'm writing this as I board the flight at 9.31 pm. The bus driver who picked us up at mm2 boarding gate dropped us at the hanger and then left stating he has to go home. Serious action should be taken against such irresponsible employees and the airline should be charged a penalty for such negligence while recruiting junior staff. It is not even funny how close we were to another aircraft which was so loud that we had to close our ears. Delay for Arik isn't uncommon but such careless behaviour is unacceptable. I won't be travelling this airline ever again. Apart from no communication for the delay the airline is as worst as it can get in the aviation industry. They have set a new low for themselves.",,,,,
"  I booked Arik flight from Lagos to Port Harcourt on February 11, 2020 to travel on February 12, 2020 using my GTbank Master Card .The payment was done on Quickteller and it showed that the transaction was successful and my account was debited accordingly. Unfortunately when I got to the airport on February 12,  I was informed at the counter that my booking was not successful and was referred to the payment section. At the payment section I was asked to contact my banker for refund which I did but I was informed by my bank that the error is from Arik. As side the fact that I missed my flight, I have also been made to suffer unduly for the negligence of your organization. I have tried to call your Account Refund line severally but no luck. I lodged the complaint with my bank which in turn contacted Keystone Bank and the bank confirmed that the payment was successful. I also took efforts to visit arik air's office, sent mail but all to no avail. It's quite unfortunate that the airline has not changed for better regarding refunds.",,,,,
  Lagos to Warri. Terrible. Last seat available was a business class seat at 70k Naira. 30k more than economy class and the same narrow horrible chairs as economy. In fact no difference between classes to justify any price difference on this aircraft. Awfully disappointing.,,,,,
" Lagos to Accra. From my experience today at Arik Air, I can describe the airline as being terribly inefficient and best avoided. The flight was delayed first for 2 hours with excuses of the plane developing a fault. Later, a staff came to tell us after 2 hours that the plane was now on ground and they were running some checks on it. After another 45 mins another staff came to tell us that actually the plane has not yet landed and they will give us an update in about 20 minutes time. No one is telling us anything and so we do not know whether we will still travel tonight or not. On informing someone about my predicament I was told I made a mistake by buying an Arik Air ticket, that this is their usual practice. I would not advise anyone to travel with this airline.",,,,,
" Without any doubt the worst business class in Africa. Everything was wrong. Even with a most expensive business class ticket, I was requested to be at the very small and terribly mediocre Freetown airport 2 hours ahead of the flight: when one knows how few flights there are per day, ridiculous. When I checked in I was guaranteed that the flight had taken off from Accra where it came from and was due on time in Freetown, when I checked later with the crew, I found out it was a total lie as the flight was delayed and it was still on the ground at that time. When I checked in, I also asked about the business lounge and was told that of course I could use it, but after immigration I discovered it had been closed and remained closed for the 3 hours I waited: one of the shopkeepers nearby told me that the staff looking after the lounge had left because ""they had other things to do"". So I had to wait on the most uncomfortable metal bench with no air conditioning for 3 hours, nothing else was available. We received no information about the delay and no Arik Air staff were visible after the check-in counter. At 1am, the boarding was done in a most unprofessional way even for this continent where I have been some 3 or 400 times. Exhausted, I'm not very young to say the least, by this horrible experience on the ground I thought I would have 1.5 agreeable hours specially being the only passenger in business class. This was wrong, very wrong. I was first requested to stop using my iPad as Arik seems to be the only airline (with SAA) forbidding the use of an iPad during takeoff and landing. I asked for a glass of wine and was offered a choice between 2 tiny plastic bottles of lukewarm undrinkable wines. Beer was also lukewarm. The dinner consisted of 2 sandwiches, worse than what a low cost airline would offer. The crew was about as nice as their fellow citizens the immigration officers at Lagos airport. Horrible experience at a cost of nearly 700 USD one way for 900 miles. A rip-off would be an understatement.",,,,,
" Accra to Monrovia. This is a terrible airline. Avoid at all cost. They sent us a message saying we should be there no later than 6am the evening before. We arrived and informed they knew something was wrong with the flight, but they just forgot to update the system. So our flight will now depart at 10:50am. We asked if we could leave and they can send a message when they are ready. They said we should wait. At 9am, we proceeded to check in and was informed now the flight is not leaving till 2pm. We again asked what the issue is, this time they said we don't have a plane. Most airlines on schedule were on time or with even a 20 mins delay, an annoucement was made. Nothing is annouced from this airline, you have to go and search for a representative, hide and seek game. No one really knows whats happening. One employee has advised us to head home, thus will proceed to leave.",,,,,
" My colleague and I were booked on an Arik Air flight from Lagos to Warri, supposed to depart at 07.40 in the morning. I received a message two days prior to the flight, informing me that ""due to operational requirements"" the flight will operate at 11.00. The morning of the flight, I received another message informing me that again ""due to operational requirements"" the flight will operate at 12.00. Once at the airport, waiting to board, we were informed the flight was delayed 20 minutes. Twenty minutes came and went and we eventually boarded and only took off at 13.00, arriving in Warri by 14.00, only getting to the hospital where we were to have 2 full days of work at 15.30. An entire day wasted by an incompetent airline. It does however get worse, it is now 2 days later and we are supposed to fly from Warri to Lagos, booked on the 09.20 flight. We have a connecting flight to Accra, Ghana at 17.10, so plenty of time to make this connection. Or so you think. I received a message from Arik 2 days ago informing me that ""due to operational"" requirements, the flight will now operate at 12.40. I'm still not too worried, as we will still make the connection. Don't hold your breath. I received another message from Arik this morning at 09.38 informing me that even this amended time has now changed to 16.40. So, to summarize - a flight supposed to have left at 09.20 has now been delayed and yet again delayed to 16.40. I phoned the Arik Air call centre, explained that I will now miss my connection to Ghana. She had absolutely no interest in my case, no offer of assistance. Her single line was ""Arik apologises"". I would not recommend this airline to anyone - despite selling tickets at certain times, they have clearly no intention of sticking to any schedule, making up flying times as it suits their ""operational requirements"". There is nothing positive I can say about this airline.",,,,,
"  I booked the earliest flight of the day out of Uyo to Lagos. I had a connecting evening flight to Frankfurt at 22.45. Our Arik flight was scheduled for 9.15 according to the ticket and so we were there at 08:00. The Lady at the check in desk immediately told us that this flight time has been moved to 12:00 a couple of days ago already and that we can check-in at 10.00, in another 2 hours. Excuse me, am I lost? I bought the ticket a day ago and so the flight time should have been adjusted on the ticket. We were so happy to leave Nigeria after a 8 month Long Job adventure that we took the delay with a tired smile. At 10.00 we checked in with the other passengers and sat till 12:00. At 12.30 it was announced that the flight will be another 45 min delayed. At 14:00 they announced flight postponed for another 2 hours. We obviously got nervous and looked into buying a ticket for the last remaining other Airline to fly out. But Arik air assured us that it will not be necessary and their flight already in the air on the way to us. This was a lie. At 16:00 they announced that the plane is now on the way and would land in 45 min. It landed 16.45 and with no further info from the ground staff we boarded. Once in the plane we were surprised to find it to be packed to the last seats. It turned out that another plane en-route to Port Harcourt is picking us up. With not much time left to catch our international flight in Lagos we headed off towards Port Harcourt. In PH it took time to unload and re-fuel and for new passengers to board. We looked at the time and it was after 18.30 when we started towards Lagos. We finally arrived in Lagos from where we had to travel to the international Airport and go through check-in and customs in rush hour. It was the worst trip we ever had and really working on our nerves. The Arik ground staff was rude and lied to us the whole day. A trip of one hour became 10 hours. Stranded at a lousy Airport. The Airline itself was an old Boeing 737. The aircon did not work througout the flight and we nearly fainted. Chairs were taped together and the seatbelt on my friends chair could not Close. I stongly suggest not to travel with Arik if you concerned about your health, safety and smooth travels. ",,,,,
"  Abuja to Lagos. Working in Nigeria for the past year I have flown Arik on numerous occasions between Abuja and Lagos and Kano. On the whole they delivered a pretty good service domestically by Nigerian standards but from about November last year they ran into serious cash flow issues due to the drop in the value of the Nigerian Naira. As a result flights became subject to regular cancellation and delay. In January the airlne was take over by the Nigerian Government and now has a much reduced service. Arik has a number of regional routes around West Africa which are well known for delays and cancellations. But the same applies to most other regional airlines. Asky is probably the best, owned by Ethiopian. They also fly (or did fly) to New York, London and Johannesburg but unless price is our only criteria, flying Arik long haul is an experience I wouldn't recommend. Inflight service is limited. Plans are old and tatty. Delays and cancellations frequent. Bags often never arrive.",,,,,
"This roundtrip from JFK to Lagos Nigeria was very bad. I had flown with ARIK air 5 years ago and was hugely disappointed with the experience this time around. My reason for flying with this airline was due to its direct flight with no layover, and the fact that I had flown with them in the past and had a good experience. This time it was shambolic. Leaving JFK, they boarded on time but we were stuck on the runway for almost an hour (I can understand it is not always the airline's fault) but the fact the flight attendant told us the in-flight entertainment would be turned on once we left the gate was kinda odd. Only to hear over the PA that the entertainment system was not working and this made every moment in the 10.5 hour flight feel frustrating for not being honest with us travelers. There was no entertainment on the return flight as well. The plane décor was less than desirable. Once you got past the business class section, the walkway carpet was in need of replacement as you could see the show and cart marks. One bathroom was non-functional and smelled unsanitary with the toilet seat broken off. I wasn't sure if the airline wasn't taking note of what needed to be fixed. The meals were nothing special. Since it was the same plane returning the above is ditto just that we left 2 hours later than we were scheduled from Lagos and they gave an excuse of being held for inspections which I didn't buy. This led to us landing on the tarmac in JFK since they lost their slot at the gates. Thus we had to be bussed to immigration and waited 1.5 hours to get our luggage. A trip and airline to forget.  And there was no wi-fi.",,,,,
"  London Heathrow to Lagos. Arik Air impressed me as I wasn't expecting the quality of service from an African airline. They have improved their services, expanded routes and fleet. I booked online but had to select my seat so contacted them on the phone. Staff was accessible over the phone they confirmed my selection then and there..",,,,,
"  I've got my ticket from Accra to Banjul on July 19. When I got to the airport on the evening of July 20 to check in, the Arik office there told me that my flight had been cancelled. There was absolutely no notification ahead of time! They later changed my flight time to the same one two days later, which made me change my business plan including the hotel reservation and the pick-up from the Banjul airport that night. Next day I asked my agent to go to their office again and she told that they refused five passengers from Accra just because the aircraft from Lagos was too small to contain more passengers. But why did they sell more tickets than the seats? It caused me a lot of trouble! Last time (in May) when I took the flight from Arik between Accra and Dakar, it delayed more that 3 hours! I will definitely exclude Arik from my business flight choice in West Africa from now on.",,,,,
"By far one of the worst experiences I have had flying out of the country. They were supposed to take me from JFK to Lagos and then to Liberia, it almost seems impossible for them. After a 12 hours layover in New York, when it came time to board, they were late checking their passengers in and then when we got to gate we sat there for another 4 hrs before they told us to line up for boarding. We waited another hour and they proceed to tell us that the flight was going to be delayed for an hour, 45 mins later we were told they were having technical issues that could last for hours. If you ever going to west Africa, Arik Air is not the airline.",,,,,
"  Flew Lagos to Dakar. I arrived at Lagos airport for my flight which was supposed to leave at 8.30pm but was delayed. The airline did not announce this delay, instead, I had to run around asking airport staff for information and thanks to a nice gentleman I finally found out the the plane was delayed 4 hours. 4 hours wait for a 3 hour flight. After waiting 4 hours the plane was further delayed an hour and once we boarded, we had to wait another hour and a half until it took off. All this time there was absolutely no communication from the airline, we were just expected to wait in ignorance. In the end I arrived in Dakar at 6am instead of 12am as scheduled. I will never recommend flying Arik Air. ",,,,,
"Our Arik Air flight from Lagos to London was originally supposed to depart at 12.55. After checking in, we we told that there would be a delay of about an hour. Just after about an hour and a few minutes, a lady came to update us telling us that there would be further delays and she didn't really know when we would be leaving. There was a lot of commotion and anger from the passengers at which she promised to do her best and while we waited we would be offered some refreshment (which never came!). About 30 mins later we were told we could board the plane. We were quite bemused as we all knew that they only boarded us that quickly to get out of the promise to give us refreshments as they should have. We all settled into our seats and sat there for another 1.5hrs with no explanations from anyone as to why there was still a delay. Passengers became agitated, angry and very upset. We eventually left Lagos at 4pm and got to London around 9pm. The treatment of passengers on the flight was shabby and unprofessional to say the least, and I will never recommend Ark to anyone.",,,,,
"Left on time for short flight of about 50 minutes from Lagos to Accra. Offered breakfast (egg, sausage and baked beans) with drinks. All nice. Had to shovel it down quickly due to the short flight time. Terminal staff let us down with my freight baggage. Couldn't be more helpful.",,,,,
"Lagos to Abidjan with Arik Air. Bad, truly very bad. The plane was really dirty, I would say it had not been cleaned for days or weeks. Travelling in business class at dinner time I was told by the chief purser that he was sorry that catering forgot to load the meals and the drinks. And I was flying out from their hub! I travel all the time around Africa but this was really one of the worst services - or should I say no service.",,,,,
"Arik Air flight from Lagos to London in economy class on A330. The inflight entertainment worked, although it is not dated. Seat was very comfortable, and the aircraft was nice and clean. Food was good but could have done with larger portions. I have flown with Arik in the past, and of late things seem to be improving.",,,,,
"No entertainment. Always late and don't care about the passengers. Have not flown the for a while because of bad service experiences in the past. Then they changed their flight schedule and it suited better time wise so I tried them again. 4 flight and 2 were delayed. Will now miss connection due to them as as expected they won't care. Food is really bad and the planes are falling to pieces on the inside. The last 4 flight has had seats with hand written notes out of order and the neck rests are not there, it's open metal rails and they are at the emergency exits. ",,,,,
"London to Lagos - most of the inflight entertainment was not working. Made the journey very boring. The food was too salty and again most of the inflight entertainment were not working. 5th July 2015 my return journey back to London with Arik Air, the flight was delayed. Our flight was meant to depart Lagos at 12pm only to be told at 12:33 that the plane was been re-refuelled. After blankets were handed out, we were expecting the headsets to be handed out. Only to be told, due to a technical glitch, there would be no in-flight entertainment at all. The plane was also very dirty. Unbelievable in this time and age. I also noticed that their food portion is getting smaller.",,,,,
W3 720 from Lagos to Abuja on 21 May 2015. W3 308 from Abuja to Accra on 21 May 2015. I am a regular ARIK passenger but have become frustrated beyond measure by the pathetic timekeeping and consistent delays experience with this airline. This morning we suffered an hour delay flying from Lagos to Abuja and tonight the Abuja to Accra flight is delayed by 2 hours thus far. Can the management of the airline not understand that people who fly are generally business people who need to be efficient and on time. Memorized standard apologies for inconvenience caused made by totally uninterested staff and flight commanders is not sufficient to cover the poor performance and failure to deliver.,,,,,
"I mostly travel with Arik Air and was never impressed. The flight from Lagos-London on 20/03/2015 was different as the inflight service was satisfactory but I noticed that the cabin crew were mostly foreigners and had a ""HiFly"" tag on. Arik should keep this standard and improve on it. The inflight entertainment was a sweet and bitter situation as some worked and some did not.",,,,,
Flight from JFK to MMA. The check in staff were helpful and polite and we thought flying Arik would be a pleasant experience regardless of the bad reviews alas this was not the case. The security briefing was uninspiring to say the least an airline of Ariks size should really use a video people had to move their heads and practically get out of their seats to see what the crew member was doing and the person with the script had trouble with reading it. The inflight entertainment system didn't work and the staff didn't seem to care they were not apologetic or surprised it made me wonder when last it had worked. The staff were very unprofessional not courtesy in the way the addressed customers they didn't offer any extra drinks or snacks for the duration of the flight until they served breakfast. The food was unappealing and small in size. Overall Arik was a great disappointment and I will never fly them long haul again.,,,,,
No airs or graces about Arik Air. My last trip from Lagos to Johannesburg was very bad firstly all passengers were waiting at the departure gate when a ground staff announced a delay because the flight staff i.e pilot and the crew were not at the airport yet. When they eventually arrived they asked us to give them some time to carry out their checks. Once onboard the customer service received was very poor. No headset provided for the entertainment system when I asked for the headset I was told they had none. Staff were very blasé about the whole situation no apology or even acknowledgement of the problems. On the return trip again the entertainment system was not working and no running water in the toilets. This is my 1st and last trip with Arik Air.,,,,,
"2 days ago I was in Lagos. There was already an 8 hour layover before I boarded this plane to JFK our boarding passes said we were to board at 9.30 pm and depart at 11.30 pm. 9.30 passed 10.30 passed. No updates as to why we were all sitting there not being attended to. A few minutes past 11 a female employee comes and tells a few people that our plane was indeed ""faulty"". Then she proceeds to say the next flight was not leaving until 10.30pm the following night. Some time went by and a male employee comes and gives us several different messages while on the phone being followed around by passengers he tells us the next flight will leave by 1.30 am long story short our original departure date of 11.30 pm turned out to actually be after 3 am. Bad customer service on the flight not organized in the airport - overall just a bad experience. I will not recommend Arik Air.",,,,,
I recently flew business class from London to Lagos and then on to Asaba. I hadn't previously heard of Arik usually preferring BA. However the Arik price was more than half the BA price and also had the guaranteed connections from Lagos. The business class product is impressive - the beds are better than BA and the cabin feels a lot more spacious (including a bar where you can go to sit). The cabin crew were also very friendly. The internal flights were both delayed because of the weather - this was dealt with well by the Arik staff. Though the inflight entertainment is not too good and the customer service is not quite up to the BA / Virgin standard I was still impressed with Arik and would certainly fly with them again.,,,,,
I waited in Port Harcourt airport for 10 hrs for a flight and we were never told a thing by Arik reps. The same I fly very frequently and I have not seen a worse airline. First you can't track the flights which wouldn't be so bad if there were any employees or a desk to find out what is going on but there isn't. In our case the flight was delayed 11 hrs. When we all showed up at the gate 11 hrs later our plane was no where to be seen and we waited with no information for another 2 hours. On our flight from NY to Lagos the planes air system was not switched on until we left the gate. The crew at least in my section did a good job to take care of us. On our flight from Lagos which was finally located and some crew from the airport loaded us on the plane there was no water soap or paper in the bathrooms. Half of the food was missing. On my return flight when I got to the airport I was told the connecting flight I was booked on does not even connect with the flight to NY in Lagos and doesn't leave for another 5 hours and that I could try again 2 days later but the same thing would probably happen. So they booked a flight connection that doesn't exist! I spent $1900 on a new flight out of SL on Brussels.,,,,,
I waited in Port Harcourt airport for 10 hrs for a flight and we were never told a thing by Arik reps. The same story for the time the plane was arriving and when it did arrive my Emirates flight had departed Lagos at 2130. I made it to Lagos at 1130 and had to change my flight and get a hotel. A poor excuse for an airline and customer relations is even worse. I came back into Lagos and got delayed by 3 hrs again coming to Port Harcourt.,,,,,
Return flight from Lagos Nigeria to London 13th July 2013. Departure was 3pm but didn't take off until 7pm. No information or explanation provided. Things got unbearable. Eventually staff advised the delay was due to lack of aviation fuel. This only angered passengers even more as it was clear this was a lie and has now become the airline's only excuse for delayed flights! Destination was meant to be London Heathrow but was informed just 20 mins to landing that it would be Gatwick. At this point there was no holding back the passengers (most of which had young children) and most refused to come down from the plane until provisions were made to get all to Heathrow.,,,,,
July 3 2013. New York City to Lagos. When we landed in Lagos we were told to fill out an Immigration form only to find out that we didn't need to fill out the form because we were transiting. Then told to go and get our suitcases. Waited 2.5 hrs only to be told that our suitcase had already been put on another plane. July 24 2013. In Accra Ghana told there was a delay on our flight to Lagos. Flight supposed to leave at 5.45pm flight did not leave until 8.30pm. When we got to Lagos we sat in the airport for 6 hours with no explanation as to why we were still in the airport. Told that once again the plane did not have fuel. Finally allowed to board. Flight attendants rude and had a nasty attitude.,,,,,
New York-Lagos-Accra return. The cabin crew was excellent. The Arik staff at Lagos airport were not the nicest people and they demanded money for everything. From Accra my group and I checked in as a group without any problems but because the folks in Nigeria wanted more Kobos and Nairas. In any case this will be my last flight on Arik unless major changes are made.,,,,,
Disappointment! This is my second time flying with Arik and service seems to have got worse. When I first travelled with Arik from NY to Lagos the television did not work on my flight there was a very nasty flight attendant and when returning from Lagos to NY the televisions did not work again so I was stuck on an 11 hour flight with children that cried most of the flight. Attendants were much more pleasant. Now my flight has been delayed for the third time tonight by Arik without any explanations! No one seems to care about customers. I wish them the best and hope they improve but as for me this will be my last time flying with them!,,,,,
Roundtrip from JFK to Lagos return to JFK last week. Although both flights left late they arrived on time. Excellent business class service. Food and service was great could not ask for any better service and flat beds afforded me a fine 8 hour nap both ways.,,,,,
No blankets provided until an 1hr into the flight staff were rude and blanket tossed at us without any form of gesture. No headsets throughout the duration of the flight expected to be staring at the screen without being able to listen. Over 3 toilets were out of service and toilets functioning were in a horrible state. When we pressed the call bell cabin crews ignored them for close to an hour. Return flight delayed 3 hours in Lagos. TV screens were not working and again no headsets. We kept complaining to cabin crew who reset the TV however never came back to check if it had started working. Again 2 of the toilets were also out of order. I believe this will be the last time I fly ARIK that is how bad a service myself and my wife received on our recent trip to Lagos Nigeria and back to London UK.,,,,,
Leg room on A340 gives a generous pitch and baggage allowance is a generous 30 kilos. Inflight entertainment was very poor. They didn't provide headphones I was told the IFE did not work in some seats. Eventually I was given headphones and told to try my luck quality was very poor. The food was very bland- and the portions small. I was within the first 20 and told the beef had run out. Crew were polite enough but I didn't get the impression of being greatly experienced. Fly Arik if you want a comfortable seat and have a lot of luggage if inflight entertainment food and service is important to you stay well clear.,,,,,
"Flew to Nigeria on Arik return. My flights were most disappointing in Premier Class (Business Class). The meals were not particularly appetizing. There a long stretch of time between the first meal and the last the attendants refused to provide snacks to passengers who asked. They gladly offered alcoholic beverages but refused snacks. The entertainment system in the premier compartment (for a 13 hour flight) was not working. Given the cost of the flight the overall poor service this experience lead me to the decision to stop flying Arik Air. On arrival at both destinations my luggage which was tagged with ""Priority"" labels but were among the last pieces off luggage to exit the plane.",,,,,
London Heathrow to Lagos in Business. From check-in to arrival staff were very good. Arik offers entry to the Skyteam Lounge at Heathrow T4. Cabin crew on the Airbus A340 were friendly welcoming and took care of passengers. Aircrafts are modern and the cabins look new. Their premium product has full flat bed seats and duvets and large screens for inflight entertainment. Food is of a high standard of quality and presentation and again the cabin crews' attitude surpassed some of the major airlines. A a spacious lounge and bar on the plane is available for premium passengers. The flight arrived in Lagos 30 minutes early.,,,,,
Arrived at Cotonou airport for flight from Cotonou to Lagos at 04.20 hours. Flight scheduled at 06.20. The flight was cancelled but the truly dreadful thing was that passengers were informed by airport security. No representative from Arik Air bothered to appear at the airport to make alternative arrangements for passengers. I was forced to hire a driver at short notice to drive me to Lagos and inevitably missed my onward connection. Customer service about as bad as it is possible to imagine.,,,,,
We have flown Martinair 3 times to Orlando. We have chosen Martinair because they are cheap and are the only one flying non-stop to Orlando. However it's a pity that you have to pay for personal entertainment in Economy whereas in the Comfort Class it's free. Further more the cabin crew on these flights were very helpful.,,,,,
I have just returned from a trip to Lagos Nigeria in Economy Class from Heathrow. I can not fault the aeroplane there was lots of leg room (and my partner and I are not short at 5ft10 and 6ft2) good entertainment selection and plenty of food and drink throughout the journey. All the staff were welcoming and the plane was clean. My only complaint would be that both food options on the way out were spicy Nigerian dishes (but this is only because I am fussy if you like spicy food you will love the selection) however on the way back there was a non spicy dish which was lovely. I would not hesitate to fly with Arik again.,,,,,
I have flown Arikair (both long & short haul) a few times now and got mixed experiences. The not so good experience was with the ground staff at Lagos in May 2010 when I was harassed & dispossessed of expensive perfume bottles (50mls each) with contents even less. I wrote a letter of complaint but never got a reply. Generally the services are fair but lack of online checking and ineffective communication has let it down. I can also observe that the aircrafts are flown 1/2 or less full most of the time and wonder why prices are still up.,,,,,
Arik Air seem to have no idea of what customer service means and how their scheduling problems adversely affect the lives of their passengers. Arik Air schedule a return flight from Accra to Lagos for 1745. the flight almost never leaves Accra before 2100 (Accra Time) which means that you arrive in Lagos at 2330 at the earliest (there are instances of the passengers finding themselves going home from the airport at 2am (Lagos time). So a journey that is supposed to be a 45min flight now becomes 6 hours with no consideration of customer comfort from the airline. On the evening flight from Lagos to Accra I have experienced similar delays (with no information coming from the Arik ground Staff) for almost 3hours. I had to call the Arik Reservations line to get information repeatedly. In Accra no information is given on the delay no provision is made from refreshments or for the comfort of Arik passengers and on top of that you get treated like a nuisance because you have to ask repeatedly on the status of the flight as no information is given either over the information system or by Arik Ground staff.,,,,,
Purchased round trip tickets from to Dakar to Freetown. Dakar to Freetown flight was 2 hours late. Our ticket for the Freetown to Dakar flight said Wednesday but when we went to the airport Wednesday morning we were told that our flight left the day before. We inquired at the Freetown office and they told us that they switched the day of that flight 6 months prior! Dakar office had sold us a ticket for a flight that did not exist! That left us to scramble and buy a ticket from another airline to make our connecting flight home. Not much of an apology either. If travelling in Africa you can expect more professionalism from a minibus driver and less snooty attitude too.,,,,,
We were due to travel from Abuja to London on 25 February - 3 days before we were notified the flight had been cancelled due to unscheduled maintenance. We attended their offices the following day and received the worst kind of customer service. Indifferent attitudes and a total lack of customer care. They couldn't tell us when next they were due to fly to London from Abuja. Neither could they arrange for us to take a flight from Lagos to London on Friday due to lack of information. It was as if no one knew what was going on and no one was bothered to find out on our behalf. They made it seem like it was our fault that the flight was cancelled and made no attempts to offer a rescheduled flight. Out of frustration we were forced to buy another ticket from another airline. To make it worse they are now refusing to provide us with a refund.,,,,,
Lagos to London. Thhe worst flight I have taken. Boarding delayed by 1 hour due to technical difficulties. When we did board there was no air conditioning and the cabin was unbearably hot. It was left for passengers to get water from the galley which was not freely offered. An announcement was then made that our direct flight would be stopping in Abuja to collect more passengers which resulted in what can only be described as a riot amongst the passengers. The cabin crew were incapable of dealing with the situation as passengers charged up and down the cabin changing seats and classes at will. After a further hour on the ground it took members of the public to pacify the passengers begging with them to return to their seats over the intercom. Eventually we did take off for the short flight to Abuja. On landing we were forced to sit for a further 2 hours without air conditioning and forced to sit through further unrest whilst the cabin crew watched on. At one stage they even threatened to leave the aircraft. Refuelling took a long long time. At this point we had still had no food and were helping ourselves to drinks. We landed in London 5.5 hours late with lame apologies and little remorse from the airline no help from ground staff with missed onward connections. I will never use Arik again.,,,,,
Dakar to Freetown return the flight was okay but the airline purposefully cheated us on purchasing the ticket in Dakar - and the return flight from Freetown was late in arriving spent more time than necessary on a stop-over in Banjul. Bottom line the service was marginally acceptable plane was modern - but they seem to be scam artists when it comes to ticketing. I would not fly Arik unless there is no other alternative.,,,,,
The worst airline I have ever flown. Nice new aircraft (ex Kingfisher Airlines) but nothing works - including the crew. Flight was 2 hours late and the service was very poor for an airline that markets itself as 'World Class'. I went to ask for water and the Cabin Crew was asleep.,,,,,
Lagos to JFK Business Class. New A340 the seat was lay flat and fairly spacious. Cabin almost empty while Economy was full. Even so the crew had trouble remembering to bring my food and never got around to headphones. The food they remembered to bring was fair to good. In seat power made up for thin AVOD so one could watch computer movie. Seat controls a bit contrived but functional. Arik was only airline in Lagos to take a credit card even though the purchase process was painful. Check in very confused but that seems to be the Lagos airport staff. Still a better experience than the US airlines international service.,,,,,
Have flown several times between Lagos domestic (Old terminal) and Warri. Flights on time and flight attendants attentive and friendly. Be warned that you'll have to hunt down your gate at Lagos if you want to be sure of catching your flight. It's not unusual for staff to just wander off for no announcements to be made and for passengers to be running across the runway at the last minute with their baggage in hand. On one occasion a Dutch wetlease service was used from Warri to Lagos older but it was a comfortable plane with one Dutch and one Nigerian FA both friendly and professional. The safety briefing was even done a second time as one passenger point blank refused to pay attention the first time and wouldn't remove their earphones. Food onboard constituted a carton of five alive juice and either a pain au chocolate or the standard Nigerian mystery meat pasty. Good luck with that one. Security at Warri as corrupt as anywhere else in Nigeria. Despite the airport being funded by Shell don't expect any special attention if you work for them though here they are particularly aggressive rather than the usual passive begging.,,,,,
Heathrow - Lagos and Lagos - Banjul. Very positive experience on every flight - both in economy and business (premier) class. LHR-LOS service excellent new aircraft flat beds in premier class - fares are more reasonable than BA and Virgin Atlantic. The issue is with their booking arrangements - you can make a reservation option online but then have to telephone to confirm and pay for the flight by phoning their London office (in my case). Also a lot of UK travel agents have difficulty booking Arik Air flights.,,,,,
Flown with them severally especially on the ABV-CBQ ABV-ENU ABV-BNI and occasional ABV-LOS route and there is still a lot to be done with regards to their customer service. Their ticketing and reservations (you can't purchase online unlike VK and AJ) systems leave a lot to be desired. Its usually chaotic at the purchase points and the ground staff are more concerned with barking orders at intending passengers. The inflight service is a continuation of what obtains on ground. Its a real shame for an airline that has such competent pilots and excellent equipment. They have to improve their act because in Nigeria they are becoming a byword for poor customer service and that has started affecting passenger loads. I only fly them because they offer direct flights to my major areas of operation.,,,,,
"Horror flight: Delayed - Seats were double booked, people who paid for more expensive spots had to take a seat in economy, families were split up over the entire airplane. Zero leg space, most of the seats could not lean backwards (if there was a person of +1.8 meters behind you, leaning back would literally crush his/her knees). Unannounced additional stop at Cape Verde, increasing the flight time from 6 to 9 hours. Very poor onboard entertainment and food. All of the above occurred on both flights, so it was not a coincidence.",,,,,
I was traveling for work to and from Amsterdam to Samos. I was seated on the first row with (even for the B737-8) a lot of space for my legs. Slept almost the whole time so for me this was a perfect flight. Cabin crew were very professional!,,,,,
AMS-AUA-AMS. I regularly fly ArkeFly between Europe and the Antilles and what a huge difference between the old and worn 767-300 with barely enough space to breathe and the new 787-800 with more spacious seats PTV and a so much better experience. Furthermore the crew seems to enjoy the Dreamliner much more and even smiles are being made! Also the time of always being delayed also seems to be over. ArkeFly improved a lot with the Dreamliner and I even prefer Arkefly above KLM now as long as they fly the Dreamliner.,,,,,
Flight Cancun-Amsterdam October 2014. Aircraft was changed and passengers like us who had bought comfort class were downgraded to economy. Flight was a nightmare with screaming kids and non-existent flight attendants. Crew blocked some comfort class seats for themselves while passengers who had paid for them flew economy. Do not fly with them!,,,,,
I flew from Schiphol to Jamaica with ArkeFly. The aircraft was old dirty and noisy. There was minimal legroom which can make a long haul flight very uncomfortable. But the worst part was the flight attendants never have I ever met so many rude flight attendants during one flight. As a passenger you are expected to feel very sorry that you came to disturb the flight attendants during their flight. If you ask for pillow or blanket all you get back is very rude words and eye-rolling you don't feel like a paying customer at all. Also the flight attendants didn't speak English even when I told them that I don't understand Dutch. Unfortunately I cannot recommend ArkeFly to anyone.,,,,,
Flew Amsterdam - Aruba - Amsterdam (OR363 and OR 364) in July 2014. The outbound flight was on one of the old 767-300's a noticeably old and used aircraft (approx. 25 y/o). The seats in economy provide just enough legroom and you indeed have to pay for everything. Since the flight was only around €50 cheaper than the KLM alternative I would not recommend this one especially due to the old and noisy aircraft the charter flight customers (many crying children) and relatively inattentive crew. However the return flight was a brand new 787 Dreamliner aircraft in which I chose to fly Star Class. The difference is huge. The aircraft is quiet spacious and the seats and service in Star Class are much like Business Class with other premium airlines. You pay €270 for an upgrade which is decent value for money. All in all I would only fly Arkefly (long distance) again if it would be in the 787.,,,,,
Flight # 396/395: We flew from Toronto to Amsterdam in August. The flight was terrible. We requested 3 vegetarian meals. We did not get our vegan meal until our return to Toronto and to add insult to injury they provided only two meals. Then the steward decided to inform me it was my fault I did not order for 3 passengers. I have proof the request was made for three passengers. Instead of apologizing for the error they diverted the error onto me. For a 10 hour flight and for the price I paid I expected better food drink and entertainment. I'll never recommend Arkefly.,,,,,
OR365 27/2/14. OR366 13/3/14. We flew from Amsterdam to Bonaire in March 2014. The flight itself was ok but for the price we paid we expected better food and drink than we received. For the 10 hour overnight return flight we waited 2 hours for a small dinner (without drinks service in between) including one tea/coffee/juice. That was it! The only other drinks service was in the morning (2 hours before landing while most people were still asleep) where we had to pay for tea or coffee! We also had to pay extra for the Entertainment system which had a very poor selection.,,,,,
Flew Amsterdam - Orlando - Miami. There are many signs that Arkefly is simply not a proper airline but just a charter operator. It goes beyond the nickle and diming that other airlines do although Arkefly takes it to a new level. The fun started a day before flying: a text message that the plane would be departing two hours late. On with the seat assignments: you have to pay for those and in a strange move you can't check in online unless you paid for a seat. At the check-in counter they had to call operations for a half hour to get me a seat only for me to find out on the plane it didn't exist. The other thing I found is that the plane was quite old (no proper overhead luggage storage) and seats were cramped old and hard as a rock. Charter flight so lots of really loud crying kids. Up to you if you mind. I flew economy comfort leg room is pretty good. As others mention everything has to be paid for except one meal and drink. No complaints there I knew that was the case and I feel that prices were reasonable. By the way don't bother to pay for IFE the selection is pretty useless. Less palatable was the fact that we were significantly delayed due to two passengers being not being admitted to the US at Orlando (stopover en-route to Miami) who were promptly put back on the plane to fly to Miami and onward to Amsterdam. If Arkefly would do passengers pre-checks in Amsterdam like grown-up airlines this wouldn't have happened.,,,,,
It is a terrible airline. I flew from Amsterdam to Sanford Orlando. The seats were just terrible. You have to pay for everything. I flew comfort and I expected to have more extras then economy but it was just the same. You only get one meal and water. If you would like a snack or just a coke you will pay for it. I couldn't sit properly in my seat I had to turn myself and lay on my side. Because otherwise I would have been seated at my fellow passengers lap. I do not recommend this airline. And please do not consider to upgrade your flight it isn't worth it. The crew is very unprofessional and will help you with nothing. It's all self service.,,,,,
"Orlando Sanford - Amsterdam September 27 2013. We flew back to Amsterdam with a 767-300 with winglets. The service on board of the personnel is professional. Legroom in Economy too. We reserved seats in the middle row they have the same leg room as economy comfort the latter is more expensive and has nothing more to offer than economy. The problem with this airline is not the legroom but the seat width. 16"" is way too narrow for such a long flight. We two adult males (5'11"") who sport a lot not overweight sat shoulder to shoulder. We had to move our body the whole time because the seats are extremely narrow. People at the window seats had less legroom but can rest against the window so they had more comfort. The narrow seats made the flight very tiring and stressing. We knew Arkefly is cheap but we didn't expect this. They cram one extra seat in width so instead of a normal 2-3-2 you get a 2-4-2 A330/787 setup in a narrow 767. Together with having to pay for every drink or additional food this made a very uncomfortable flight. Even the coffee had to be paid for only water was for free but that tap was next to the toilets and looked dirty with calcium attached. So despite the professionalism of the cabin crew we will never ArkeFly again. We read somewhere Arke is going to cram also an extra seat in de 787 like this. Their 787 goes from 2-4-2 to 3-3-3 777 setup. Horrible! In the end with paying extra for drinks and food and reserving a seat we were better off with United or Delta.",,,,,
Flight Amsterdam - Kos. I booked premium comfort class. Because of technical problems they changed planes. I didn't get the premium comfort extra's I had paid for. They had no solutions with a bad service.,,,,,
Definitely the worst option. No frills works for flights less than 2 hours only. Transatlantic on an older smaller plane with very limited entertainment and food options is not worth the savings. By the time you pay for all the luggage fees seat fees and food/entertainment your savings go from $200 to $100 (approx). Also you won't get any miles on your credit card or miles on your preferred airline because they only accept wire transfers! Forget to mention that the wire costs are $40-$50.,,,,,
This airline is the worst for transatlantic flights in my opinion. I took a flight to Natal Brazil this February. The airline charges for everything €10 for a personal entertainment kit (otherwise no TV for 9.5 hours!) €25 to be able to get an assigned seat €350 for a Coca Cola only water coffee and tea is free of charge. No blanket only one meal served. I don't have a problem with airlines charging for extras - what Arkefly calls extras would be included standard in every other transatlantic airline. Furthermore the seats are terrible I booked their Comfort Class which is just as small as economy in any other airline. No priority boarding etc the only extra I got was a €1 headphone to listen to the radio. I personally think that Arkefly uses the same planes as they would on a flight within Europe. Those are just not up to standard if you have a 9.5 hrs flight to Brazil!,,,,,
Went to Miami with Arkefly. Premium Comfort was good for the price back home comfort class was also good and no delays. I read all the reviews and was nervous but everything was fine. It's not very expensive so don't expect too much.,,,,,
Flight to Hurghada with a stop in Sharm el Sheikh. With a 737-800 in sardine configuration the flight was terrible no space for your legs and seats recline no more than about 2 cms. If you are over 1.70m this is extremely tight and for a flight of 5 hours that is just not acceptable. On the return flight from Hurghada (which was delayed for more then an hour) we paid 6 Euros per person to book a seat which we found was already occupied by people that got onboard in Sharm el Sheikh. Not even offered a free drink for the delay. Never again. Food and drinks are limited and overpriced and comfort and premium comfort classes are a joke on 737's.,,,,,
Amsterdam to Mombasa. Paid extra for comfort class and was given the row in front of the emergency exit where the seats could not recline at all. Therefore even worse comfort than sitting in economy class.,,,,,
Since the Star class was changed into Premium Comfort the level went down dramatically less space between the chairs much smaller seats. Especially on long haul it is two steps back but price is almost the same level. Staff friendly and helpful.On European flights the additional money between comfort class and premium comfort is a waste.,,,,,
Flew from AMS to Aruba still have to make the return flight Monday not looking forward to this at all - although at least we have comfort class for the return flight-Row 27. Arrived at Schipol early to avoid traffic delays etc could not check bags in despite already having checked in online once at boarding gate no system no control just a big mess. On the plane we had the last row of seats these hardly reclined at all with little room in front this was no fun for 10 hours. Paid online in advance for entertainment yet had to wait for more than an hour for it to be turned on due to our last row seat - choice of films not good at all. Crew very overworked and did not care at all. Gangway between seats so narrow that if you sat in aisle seat you had constant knocks from crew or passengers walking up and down. No mention that flight would stop in Curacel then got turfed off the plane had to go through customs then queue again to get back on-free seating for this last part of the flight also. Storage was poor on lockers had one of bags placed at the other end of the plane and due to narrow aisle was very hard to get to as the aisle blocked by staff So for the return lest hope Comfort class and row 21 proves better? Thinking of upgrade to Premium Comfort but not sure it is worth it?,,,,,
Used ArkeFly for two holidays this year: Las Palmas Gran Canaria in May and Mombasa Kenya in August/September. To Gran Canaria was a very pleasant flight we unexpectedly all had an own personal entertainment screen in the headrest and on our return journey too. Therefore we expected to have them on our 11 hour long intercontinental flight to Mombasa but surprisingly we did not real letdown. Our seats (row 15 before the emergency exits) were said to have 'limited reclining capability' but they did in fact not move one inch at all on the journey there they did recline a bit on our red-eye back. We flew comfort class which is really worth the additional charge (15EUR per person per flight). The 8 centimetres extra are the difference between sleeping fairly comfortably or cramped and the night comfort kit really helped me get some rest. Out of the 4 flights 1 was delayed but it was only a little over an hour and they caught up a with quite a few of the lost minutes. Clean planes easy self service luggage check-in friendly staff reasonable prices for airplane food and always good landings so I'd use them again.,,,,,
We used Arkefly twice this year departing from Amsterdam: once to Curacao return and once to Antalya Turkey return. Out of the 4 flights 3 were great and one really bad. The intercontinental flights and one flight AMS-Antalya: enough space in the airplane friendly staff and service quite good (despite the plane being 100% full on both flights). Limited choice Inflight Entertainment (IFE) but one could find something to watch. Food usual plane stuff one meal free extras with payment. Departure times perfectly respected smooth landing. No complaints. We flew comfort class. We loved the facility of being able to check in our luggage from the long term parking building. Brilliant idea thank you. No waiting lines no carrying luggage to the departure desk. Last flight Antalya-AMS: not enough leg space tiniest airplane ever we flew packed. No food or drinks for free. NO IFE. Departure times respected. All in all: would fly again intercontinental would hesitate a bit for short distance flights.,,,,,
AMS to MIA on 6/18/12. I didn't know this airline before and I was a little concerned. They upgraded me for EUR 96 to their comfort premium class. Everybody was very friendly and professional the 767 was very clean excellent food and service. I'm very impressed and I'm looking forward to my flight back to AMS.,,,,,
They have a new policy that no seat must be left empty yet their planes have rows of 3 seats. So if you are travelling with a group of 2 you are not allowed to sit next together as long as there are free single places or you are willing to pay 100 euros extra. There is nothing premium about their premium class. Unfortunately if you are flying from The Netherlands you have no other option for most tourist locations.,,,,,
They charge for everything and notify you of additional stops after you book. It made things extremely difficult with a 2 year old. I had to pick up luggage upon arrival in the US and recheck it for the remainder of the flight. My purchased seats were not available to Amsterdam. The reason I paid extra for seats was to be close to toilets with my son. On the return to Miami we were given the wrong gate number and no priority (toddler) boarding. Staff were very rude.,,,,,
Unfortunately Star Class has been replaced by so called 'Premium Class'. Flying from AMS to Natal/BRA return it was not a good experience. Seats are small and uncomfortable food very average and full plane had to do with 3 toilets. There was one near the 'premium' area that resulted in continuous queues of waiting travelers in the aisle. Flying back my partner and I wanted to ensure seats near one another and for that we had to pay extra! The service level does not at all equal Star class. I need to look for another airline flying NL-Brasil.,,,,,
MIA to AMS Jan 2012 on B767. Very good service onboard flight was on time. We had severe turbulence on this flight and I expected a remark from the captain at this point. Price/Quality excellent EUR400.,,,,,
Flew back from Barbados to Newcastle after a Thomson Cruise. This was probably the best Thomson flight we have had there were complimentary drinks entertainment newspapers etc and I have to say the food provided was good by airline standards. The plane was a 767 and probably only a couple of years old. I would have given 10 for satisfaction if it had not been for a 2 hour delay.,,,,,
I flew from Orlando to Amsterdam in premium comfort class. The flight was actually pretty good. It was on time convenient priced right service was good and the food not too bad. If you compare it to the major long haul carriers ie Delta Lufthansa Virgin etc you will find some areas that do not compare..ie the seats only recline they do not lie flat no power for computers older planes and basic service is offered not over the top like some carriers. I would recommend this carrier as a low cost alternative to the big airline companies.,,,,,
CUR-AMS-CUR Premium Comfort Class worth the extra EURO 200. 2x3x2 seats configuration instead of 2x4x2 (on B767). Enough legroom. Only 5 rows with own cabin staff. Welcome drink 2 good meals snack alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks included. One minus: even though the distance between the seats is big the seats cannot recline any further than in the other classes.,,,,,
ArkeFly Star Class to Dominican Republic and to Curacao. The planes are very old and so are the seats. There is space for star class seats and good service compared to price of the ticket. The staff was friendly and helpful.,,,,,
Toronto to Amsterdam return. Bird was caught in engine upon take off. After in the air for 45 minutes to offload fuel safe landing back at Schiphol. The flight was only delayed four hours. Water served upon landing as we had to wait 30 minutes in the plane. Very impressed with service for such a low cost airline.,,,,,
Flight from UK to Cancun was throughly unpleasant. Staff with one exception seem to hate their job. Charged extortionate money for everything takes about 3-4 hours to get a paid for drink. Passengers revolted against entertainment charge of £10 to even watch anything and staff relented and gave it out for free. Took them hours to serve food we ended up being given kids meals with playing cards - absolutely revolting. Couple behind me on honeymoon lost their prepaid for premium seating and no one knew anything about a bottle of champagne they had ordered. Stock line of staff was to blame Thomas Cook.,,,,,
Flight to Curacao in economy class. I never had such a bad flight with unfriendly staff. The one free meal was bad for the rest you have to pay. Seat was very narrow. For menever again with Arkefly.,,,,,
CUR-AMS comfort class on B767. Seat very narrow and no support. Legroom ok. Food one free meal was really bad and a small portion - no salad or desert or bread roll. Seat was not working would not recline! Nothing could be done staff did not seem to care. All other food and drink for sale during the flight - quality of food again pretty low. Staff friendly but goes thru the motions.,,,,,
Amsterdam-Cancun (stopover Varadero). The trip started with a delay of already 3.5 hrs. Once in the air service not too friendly. Food very poor quality (one meal free one drink free I took 1 litre of water extra with me) seats very cramped even in 'Comfort' Class - comfort that's a joke!. In Cuba it became clear that there was something wrong with the engine - 'Don't worry it's totally safe to fly on to Cancún but regulations make us perform a repair' - you don't feel very safe when they say this. We got off the plane and spent a couple of hrs. at the airport - good cheap beer and cigars. We left Cuba with a total of 5.5.hrs delay. 'To make up for the delay we offer all passengers a free cup of water' the purser said - very funny and of course totally inadequate.,,,,,
Holguin to Gatwick - told 5 days before return flight that the plane would be Arkefly with no Premium facilities which I had booked. The seats were thin and uncomfortable the food was indescribably bad and I ended up facing a bulkhead - despite reassurance from the Thomson rep that this would not happen. The plane was delayed 6 hours leaving us to sweat it out in Holguin airport with only a soft drink and cheese or ham roll (no butter) for sustenance. The crew were surly and unhelpful and tv monitors showed two films either side of an hour long programme about a Dutch chef.,,,,,
Amsterdam to Cancun via Holguin/Cuba. Very cheap upgrade from Economy Class to Comfort Class. Worn out seats but offering extra legroom and moveable headrests. Crew very friendly. On the downside only radio channels are free - no video entertainment on main screens. But you could rent a DVD-player for 12 Euro extra total rip off! Also only one meal with drinks after take-off is for free after that everything except water has to be paid for. Arkefly is a good company but this pay-for-everything extra like low cost model is not working on long haul flights.,,,,,
Amsterdam to Jerez de la Frontera in Comfort Class. Very comfortable charter flight in brand new B737-800 strictly on time. Friendly crew. Service not included not cheap of course but reasonably priced. Would recommend this charter airline.,,,,,
Amsterdam-Bonaire return in Comfort Class. We have checked-in online so supposed to just drop off our bags at a special desk. Arkefly makes a mess of thnigs. There is no drop off point and we have to get in line with all the other passengers for three different flights. Only three positions open. Aircraft is worn tv screens do not work properly. Service friendly but mediocre. Almost everything but the one evening meal has to paid for. Food is extremely bad. Wine is awful. We paid specifically for seats with extra leg room. After a short lay over on Curaçao. The seating becomes free for the passengers that have to get off at the next stop Bonaire so we loose our seats for the last half hour of our flight.,,,,,
Holland to Jamaica return in Star Class Arkefly's equivalent of Business Class. Both flights departed over 2.5 hours late our seats still had the previous passenger's meal remainders. Planes are very very old. Staff friendly food is average but reasonable for charter. We wouldn't fly this airline again.,,,,,
"  This is by far the worst and non-reliable airline I've ever used. They departed 3 hours before the departing time shown on the ticket without notice. When I asked for the refund, they are keep saying we will pass this email to specialist but didn't hear from specialist for almost one months. Of course they did not refund the ticket. Do not use this airline if you want to ruin your holiday. Also, whatever they say, you won't get the money back since they will never reply your email.",,,,,
"  This is the worst airline I had experience with. My flight was cancelled so that I wasn't informed about it. Employees of the company office located in Yerevan are so much unprofessional that it's better not to ask them even elementary question as their answer anyway will be - ""I don't know"". They don't speak English at all and their Russian is totally impossible to understand. When you call to their office, minimum 10-12 times you should call to be answered once, messenger works terribly, nobody gives you proper replies. This is the company with non-professional, irresponsible and incompetent staff with incompliant service and terrible attitude to their customers. ",,,,,
"  While in Europe you only get a free seat and a shabby lunch set on short and medium-haul routes, at Asiana the business customer gets a top-quality product on a flight from Korea to Japan. Add to this that the departure times are on time, the service is first class and the staff is professional and friendly. For this you pay about the same price as with a European airline.",,,,,
  I recently flew with Asiana Airlines from Almaty to Sydney with my two young pre-school children. We arrived slightly late to the flight. Two of our check-in bags were slightly over the standard weight limit of 23 kilograms. Asiana Airlines insisted that we either repack our bags to fit within the 23-kilogram limit or pay a significant fee for the excess weight. I requested an exception to be made based on our circumstances. The regional manager exhibited rudeness and a lack of understanding. This service was not only disappointing but also added unnecessary stress to an already challenging experience.  I urge Asiana Airlines to reassess their baggage policy to allow for reasonable flexibility. ,,,,,
 Best airline I've had the pleasure to fly with. Positives: Excellent customer service. Comfortable seats. Both the flight to Seoul from London and the flight to Tokyo from Seoul. Good quality amenities. Clean and well stocked rest rooms. Decent size too. Good food. Good lounges. Organised. Negatives: Cabin temperature was very warm. Prevented me from sleeping.,,,,,
"  The first 10 rows of economy during the booking process. This was available after check in opened. Check in at Honolulu was quick and easy. One annoying thing is that they call their second-lowest frequent flier tier ""Gold"" which confuses me because I am Star Alliance gold, and some of the gate agents directed me to the wrong line for boarding, and almost tagged my luggage with lower priority. They directed passengers at Honolulu to use the United Club, but I decided to detour to the other side of the airport and use the ANA lounge. Boarding was orderly, and I was given a warm welcome on all flights. Asiana also hands out slippers and a toothbrush kit on their long haul flights. The legroom at 33"" was great, but the pictures online showed that they have footrests on the 777, but on both of my flights, they did not. The A380 had footrests installed, which added greatly to the comfort. The seats were a bit solid, but not too bad. Food onboard was excellent, on the Honolulu to Seoul flight, there was a full lunch after takeoff, a ham and cheese sandwich halfway through the flight, and another full hot meal prior to landing. The Seoul to Bangkok flight left quite late, and dinner was served, and I had the Bibimbap. The presentation was exceptional for this dish, the bowl was made out of fine bone China. All food served was absolutely delicious. The only two criticisms I have would be that they should serve meals with a bottle of water, and the cups for drinks are tiny. The service from the flight attendants was absolutely faultless. They were all genuinely nice and friendly, and were all highly professional. There was a small language barrier when the flight attendant didn't understand my request for a bloody mary - she bought me half a glass full of vodka and another full glass of tomato juice. The entertainment selection had nothing I wanted to watch. Asiana Business class lounge in Seoul isn't too bad, there is a selection of hot food, salad, instant noodles and a bar area. I was slightly disappointed that there wasn't any sweet pastries or cakes offered, there were croissants, sliced bread and rolls but nothing sweet. The rest of the lounge is pretty good, a good choice of seating, an abundance of power outlets and clean bathrooms, but the only thing missing is Wifi but Incheon Airport has some of the fastest free wifi so I just used that instead. Asiana Airlines has a good offering, but I would say they have room to improve, especially since the improvements are just some minor things such as providing napkins and water bottles to passengers.",,,,,
"  I booked a weekend flight with Asiana Airlines from Singapore to Seoul, South Korea in early April 2023. I was due to attend a weekend event in Seoul but unfortunately the event had to be postponed 5 days before the date due to an unforeseen event. A fire broke out at the event venue parking. Upon knowing this, I called the Asiana Customer Service hotline. Sean attended to my call and I explained the situation to him. He understood that this was beyond my control and agreed to give a full refund. I received the full refund receipt after our call ended. The interaction was efficient, fuss-free and simply outstanding. It was also very easy to get hold of the customer service rep without long waiting time. Asiana truly exceeded all my expectations. Because of this outstanding service, I hope to be able to fly with Asiana Airlines for my future trips! Thanks Asiana!!!",,,,,
"  Boarding was on time on an A330 in a good condition and clean. There was IFE and inflight service was great, hot-meal in such a short flight. Crew was very friendly. Seat was comfortable and leg room was good.",,,,,
"  Great experience. A350 clean and in good condition, welcome was friendly and tentative even cabin was full. Departure on time, captain welcomed us and explains the route till the destination. IFE was OK, limited to my taste of movies. I managed to find 2 movies to keep me busy. In Flight Service was exceptional, I had ordered Western menu. Everything was perfect and tasty. Obstacle they do not offer pajamas. You can have WiFi connection but you have to pay even if you are in Business Class.",,,,,
" This is one of the best experience in my life. I have flew long international flight many times all over the world. Out of these, this one is memorable. Though, I have flown Sydney to Texas in many airlines, Asiana provided the best hospitality, foods and beverages, drinks, tea and coffee, information, and announcement. Flight attendances were like models of k-pop. I observed every aspects of the journey very curiously and found sweet. Only the lacking thing was the language (English), but was understandable. Though it was a very long flight from Sydney to Incheon and Incheon to San Francisco was astoundingly sweet. The whole team, please keep up the good work.",,,,,
"  On my flight from Incheon to Los Angeles the woman next to me laid down on the 2 seats since the husband took other seat that’s empty, her feet were on my side moving and putting it up. I have put the blanket and pillow on my side but she moves a lot and it’s crawling on my side. Finally I called the flight attendant to show her and she tried pushing her feet but it keeps moving to me still, I can’t get any sleep so I asked the attendant if I can sit elsewhere till it’s time to land.  I love flying Asiana, but maybe next time have to change airline.",,,,,
" Overall experience on Asiana was not great. The attentiveness and friendliness of the flight attendants and crew was the real positive. The plane was old, business class seats were uncomfortable and too short. Food was just ok. The flight itself was one of the bumpiest I've been on. ",,,,,
"  Onward flight time in April 2023 changed so connection with same airline no longer viable (connection now leaving before inbound arrives). Airline did not recognise this, although 1st leg booked on same ticket with same airline. Impossible to contact airline, twice got through to English option at head sales office in Korea after long wait, no one spoke English. No option to change online, without cancelling ticket and rebooking. No sales office in UK on website, found a telephone line for UK sales office, just an answer phone, no one responded to message I left. Booked original ticket through the Asiana website, so no excuse for them not handling my requests.",,,,,
" Even older plane than on the way out, still not lie flat bed. Staff good, provided sandwich and drink very fast. Lounge at Almaty poor, no alcohol for Asiana.",,,,,
" Well its been many years since I left China due to covid. Asiana has changed, not as good, oldish 330, meals very average as was the wine. No hot towels, poor entertainment. Flight fairly empty, nearly 7 hours flight time. Seats do not lie flat. Staff were good though.",,,,,
"  The passenger experience has worsened beyond imagination. Even though I was being seated in Business, had little expectation for Asiana's product as their fleet is aging without much refurbishment, but now it seems that the flight crew is losing it. They forgot to serve my bread until the end of the meal in Business Class.",,,,,
"  Awful experience. Asiana are very impossible to contact regarding customer service. On our way to Australia, our luggage was lost. We were visiting for a wedding, attending two days after our arrival. We were left with no contact, updates or baggage for five days. We were forced to replace necessary items, of which the cost was significant due to the nature of the trip. Asiana have offered to compensate $150 AUD. This is absolutely atrocious. We were left with no baggage for five days (half of our trip) and to top it off, baggage was lost on our return, I have yet been able to make contact with anyone from Asiana and it has been two full days. They would be great to fly with if everything goes exactly to plan. I will never risk flying with them again.",,,,,
"  The service was great, especially the flight crews. However, I cannot say anything nice about the service for the check in. Was super rude and condescending. At both incidents. At the SFO Airport Check in I was told to get out of the Business Line and que up in the Economy line. And when in Korean Airport, I Asked the Asiana Crew at gate 12. Where is the East Lounge was. I was told to go sit down, there is no Lounge for Economy Flyers. ",,,,,
" Jakarta to Frankfurt via Seoul. Long way to get a last minute still reasonably priced one-way ticket to Europe from Jakarta: 7 hrs to Seoul and then after a 2 hrs layover a 13 hrs flight from Seoul to Frankfurt, avoiding Russian airspace. First part on a quite outdated A330 with reasonable seat pitch. Red-eye flight, so upon departure little sandwich with multiple rounds of orange juice or water and 2 hrs before landing breakfast, which was reasonable. Second flight on a brand new A350 with excellent seat pitch, good meals and multiple rounds of drinks (soft drinks, beer, wine etc). Though everything really was very good and both flights had very nice crews, probably Asiana should do something with the entertainment system: simply there is too little choice to select, especially for such longer flights as ICN-FRA. So, bring a good book with you or (as I did) download some movies on your personal devise.",,,,,
"  As I got to the airport early, I was cueing in their check-in line. I've never seen the ground staff lining up few minutes early before the open the counter to greet the passengers. I thought it was a nice gesture from their part. They were also accommodating with my checking needs as my luggage was heavier than limits. The flight attendants were polite. The plane strangely didn't have screens for each seat but it provided wifi access so people can use the entertainment platform via their own devices. Overall, I was quite happy with this airline.",,,,,
"  
Smooth check-in in business class area, being Star Alliance Gold Member. Could get in their lounge, which looks great but has little food and drink options. Flight with ok seat-pitch and ok food, several rounds of drinks. Crew not really interacting with passengers, I didn’t really feel welcome, strangely I always have this feeling with Asiana.",,,,,
" Tokyo to Tashkent via Seoul. Booked ticked for family. Since we had newly born child, I called Asiana Airlines to add him. Eventually they did not (we found it out during check in time). Called to check opening time for luggage check in. Was told different time than the actual. It took 1 hour to check in our suitcases by using individual mileages.  During passport check, Asiana Airlines did not delay the flight 10-15 minutes. Staff was very cold, did not show any empathy to help, and communicate what I am requesting to her pilot?  Had to pay extra $500 to change the tickets. Could not use Family Mileage. Could not get reasonable explanation from staff. Worst experience ever.",,,,,
"  The flight attendants are not very helpful when putting luggage in the overhead cabin. I asked one of the flight attendants to help me with my luggage but one of them said that “If you can’t manage to put your own luggage in the overhead cabin, you put it in the hold”. Two of the flight attendants face were very condescending. I expected respect and excellent service but didn’t get it at all.",,,,,
"  I bought my tickets via Expedia in February 2020, but started cancelation process in March and approved in April 2020 for full refund by Asiana's rep on the phone and Expedia. By Asiana's policy, I had canceled 92 days prior to flight so I was in the clear. Expedia couldn't get in contact with Asiana to clear the transfer of funds while I was on chat and by email, throughout the months.  Finally called the Korean branch to see if someone would respond since their other branches weren't responding. The exchange was not pleasant when we got a rep, got blamed for not contacting sooner, they said no one will authorize the refund now because of the situation, many other excuses that didn't make any sense. Finally after 6 months of trying to contact Asiana refund finally clears. The bitter taste of how they are handling the process has left me never to fly them again.",,,,,
"  In flight entertainment is not good,  american movie or japan, movie has no Korean subtitles only Korean dubbing. Avod is too old. Second in flight meal is greasy first meal is bibimbap (Korean food). Value for money pretty good, cabin staff service really good. Ground service normal,",,,,,
"  Bangkok to Los Angeles via Seoul on Asiana. First time with this airline. My family and I were all very pleasantly surprised to the level of service, food quality, attention to details such as tooth brush and personal kit even in Economy. The flight attendant were all incredibly kind and helpful. Unlimited drinks and the food was delicious. My original business class AC flight was cancelled due to Covid. I had not flown in economy overseas in over a decade and was very apprehensive with the long distance. Not that I would fly economy again but if I had to, Asiana would be my first choice. Thank you for making this trip more pleasant.",,,,,
"  Seoul to Hanoi on 29th February booked through Air Canada. I arrived into Seoul on United Airlines from San Francisco and by the time I got to the gate for my next flight, I found out that the flight had been canceled - I received no information about the cancellation. I asked staff to guide me to who I need to talk to or where to change/rebook my flight to Hanoi. But none of them could help me, they all said “I don’t know”. I ended up staying one night at the airport and bought my own ticket to Hanoi the next day. I couldn’t believe that they canceled my flight without informing me, and staff were so  rude. to me..",,,,,
"  Syracuse to Seoul via New York. I booked an itinerary that involved a JetBlue flight from Syracuse to JFK, then an Asiana flight from JFK to Seoul. However, with less than 48 hours left until the start of the trip, JetBlue cancelled its flight. Trying to be flexible, especially during a situation of a global pandemic, I booked a cab service that would bring me to JFK on time for my second flight. When I called Asiana Airlines to confirm the status of my flight (after waiting on the phone for a very long time), they told me that because I couldn't follow the order of the itinerary (as in take the JetBlue flight first), they could not let me on the plane, even though I had paid for my ticket in full.  Even after I had explained that my JetBlue flight was modified and thereby it was impossible for me to follow the order of the itinerary, the customer service representatives (I spent hours on the phone taking to more than one) kept repeating that this is was company policy and that I could not be on the plane. How is this kind of blatantly exploitative, unethical practice allowed?  They are completely refusing to be flexible and even are denying my request for a refund.",,,,,
"  Seoul to Los Angeles. Boarding was orderly, with temp. Check of all passengers, aircraft was clean, food average, attentive flight attendants and pleasant at all times. Needs improvement on headphones, lavatory I used halfway thru the flight was nasty. Smooth flight overall",,,,,
"  Sydney to Seoul. Asiana have got their mojo back. After not flying with them for about 5 years, I was really surprised with how good these flights were. Great service with excellent English spoken from the crew. Not at all robotic and always happy to help. Good food, wine and champagne. The entertainment offered is still pretty awful but there was enough to get by for this trip. I was very sad to have to cancel my trip last week. Hopefully South Korea and Asiana will weather the current turmoil. My thoughts are with you all.",,,,,
" Dalian to Bangkok via Seoul. On both flights, service was good, quiet in Business to Seoul, but fairly full to Bangkok. Cabin Service good, entertainment good and seat comfort very good. Meals and beverages good, with good Western choice.",,,,,
" London to Seoul via Osaka with Asiana Airlines. I was very surprised by this airline. First leg of the journey we were going on the A350, we had plenty of leg room though the seats were a bit uncomfortable. Cabin crew were very friendly and they spoke perfect English. Food was very good, I chose the Korean option from London to Seoul and when coming back to London I chose the western option. Very good both for airplane food. If you don't like spicy don't choose the Korean option. Entertainment was a bit limited, not as many options as other carriers like Emirates and I was disappointed they didn't have any Korean dramas. Overall a good airline, price was cheap compared with Korean Airlines or the Japanese carriers.",,,,,
"  New York to Osaka via Seoul. I like Asiana Airlines in general; their planes are new and they provide reliable service. They don't always give a professional impression, but I think they still provide a high level service. I was disappointed this time as they did not load my luggage, and I had to spend three days without it. They acted as if they bore no blame at all. I hope they improve customer service to the same level as their other aspects.",,,,,
"  Tokyo to London via Seoul. Spacious comfortable seats for long-haul flights, very helpful and friendly staff. Check-in was easy and ground staff very professional. The food could be a bit better but still no complaints.",,,,,
" Seattle to Incheon. Very good to flight. Boarsing time is accurate and fast. The airline representatives help to the elder person take by wheelchair. It is so nice and awesome. Also, the staff are kind.",,,,,
"  The Asiana business class seat was smaller than I expected and service was worse than I expected. My food was not delicious with a limit choice of meals. I was bored by the entertainment. Blanket, a pillow and slippers provided. Pyjamas and mattress were not provided for sleeping time and I need to make bed myself. I could not sleep well due to uncomfortable bed. The staff at Sydney check in did not add my mileage points to my Asiana Club member when I requested. I need to claim my missing mileages when I got home. This is my first time I did not enjoy a business class flight.",,,,,
" First time with Asiana - I was re-routed on these flights by Lufthansa as my original flight Frankfurt-Qingdao was cancelled by a strike. It was a very good surprise. Frankfurt-Seoul I was flying Business Suite, a first class seat with Business service. The seat was fantastic, large, comfortable, in a sort of ""closed"" cab - I never slept so well in a plane. Service was perfect, crew very kind and helpful, food OK (Korean food). In-flight entertainment reasonable, not easy to understand and limited choice - but good enough. Flight perfectly on time. Flight Seoul-Qingdao is short, just over an hour - but business class they were able to serve a full meal with drinks (several refills) even if the plane was almost fully booked. Some delays, but in Qingdao it is almost normal.",,,,,
"  Tokyo to Seoul. Comfortable seat and good amount of space. However needed to ask for drink before take off and was told that the champagne was frozen so that we could not have any! Got some eventually, Korean menu was good quality bimibap, but wine selection was atrocious. FAs seemed to disappear and not very attentive. Was okay as a short 2.5 hour flight but expected better.",,,,,
"  Honolulu to Bangkok via Seoul, this flight was most uncomfortable. The planes was very dated with just a little TV screen mounted on the seat. There was no leg room with small seats. The only decent flight was return from Bangkok to Inchon which was a newer plane lots of leg room large TV screen but limited movies. But the long flight to Honolulu was back to small seats.",,,,,
  Okinawa to Seoul. I will never choose Asiana again. They checked my baggage through without asking and didn’t apologize. Ground service rude and not able to speak English to me. ,,,,,
"  San Francisco to Seoul. Have been flying Asiana regularly for a decade to and from Korea, and have never been disappointed. Extremely professional staff and a very pleasant in-flight atmosphere. For under $200 extra you can upgrade to premium economy, which provides a seat in one of the first 5 rows and significant additional leg room. Can't stress enough how friendly and, above all, professional the staff (both check-in and in-flight) have always been.",,,,,
"  Chitose to Jakarta via Incheon. The airline refuse to take 1 luggage for 2 people because it is several kgs overweight. Instead they charge passenger. Im disappointed at this airline. The food is so so, flight cabin is so so. ",,,,,
"  Osaka to London via Seoul. It’s impossible to find fault with Asiana. Both outbound and inbound flights were great. Seat width and pitch probably the best I’ve experienced in economy in last 5 years. Food delivered with metal cutlery, food choices great, service impressive. All 4 flights arrived earlier than scheduled. Transfers in Seoul Incheon incredibly efficient. Why on earth can other airlines not operate like Asiana?",,,,,
"  Osaka to London via Seoul. First time to fly Asiana Airline, although I had heard good things about it. Flight was almost impeccable: Osaka to Seoul and Seoul to London arrivals were on time, was confirmed my pre-selected aisle seats as well as vegetarian meals (which were served very quickly). Flight attendants were kind and professional, airplane was clean, with multiple lavatories for a comfortable flights for everyone (no lengthy queues). Other small and positive details: flight to London, slippers for all passengers in economy were provided, as well as air combs and moisturizer in lavatories. The vegetarian meals were actually and surprisingly very good (the bread was not though), and between the two meals there were additional snacks. Both flights had plenty of space for hand luggage. Only negative note: movie selection was rather small with almost non-existent European movie category but at least there were some good Korean options - which was nice for a change from the usual Hollywood only options. All in all, recommend.",,,,,
 Bangkok to Los Angeles via Seoul. Asiana is great! Food is brilliant. Service is excellent. The staff are very polite and helpful from ground staff to cabin crews. No attitude. I would definitely fly with them again.,,,,,
"  Sydney to Seoul Incheon. Excellent attentive service from cabin crew, better than most other Asian carriers including Thai Airways. Good food and beverage, an enjoyable sandwich offered mid-flight. Flight crew and cabin staff very big on safety during turbulence. Cushioned seats good for economy seating. Cabin clean, toilets better hygiene and appearance than Qantas business A380. Airline departed late due to busy takeoff traffic Sydney however, arrived on time at Incheon. A great airline I did code shared with Qantas to Seoul Incheon, Asiana part of Star Alliance would rate them a 5-star airline.",,,,,
  New York to Manila via Incheon. First time flying with Asiana Airlines and the service is really good. Flight attendant is helpful. Food is delicious and there's enough legroom. Inflight entertainment is good. Although flight is delay for 30 minutes. I will definitely fly again with Asiana Airlines on my next flight. I have a suggestion that they provide free shuttle to their passengers from New Jersey it will be a big help just like other airline did.,,,,,
" Singapore to Seoul. My wife and I were travelling with our 8-month-old baby. During online check-in for SIN-ICN, it appeared that there was no way to request for a bulkhead seat, hence we decided to request over the counter. Unfortunately, the bulkhead seat was unavailable, but the gate agent was kind enough to allocate an empty seat, allowing us 3 seats across. Appreciated the gesture very much. She also mentioned that on the return trip from Seoul, a note would be made to the airline to allow for a bulkhead seat. Sadly, during check-in over the counter, it seemed that the request was not processed by the airline and no effort was made to salvage the situation. Instead, the gate agent told us to pay extra for a bulkhead seat which was in the forward economy cabin (there are two economy cabins; forward required payment, back did not require payment). We were shocked to know of such a practice - trying to squeeze every dollar out of passengers, what more passengers who have paid a premium over a low-cost carrier. A complete lack of empathy. No infant seat belt issued on both flights. Limited in-flight entertainment (more like a 3 or 4-star airline standard). New A350 aircraft. On time departure and arrival. Asiana does not deserve the 5-star airline rating. Not recommended to fly unless the price is on par with other 4-star airlines. You are better off with flying on 5-star airlines like Singapore Airlines, ANA or Qatar Airways.",,,,,
"  Ho Chi Minh City to Seoul. Asiana Airlines is the third 5-Star airline that I have travelled (after Eva Air and ANA). It is clear that Asian's airlines are better than others. Cabin crews were very kind, skilled and the meal was very good. Asiana deserves to be rated 5-Star.",,,,,
" Such a 5 star experience with Asiana Airlines! OZ from SGN-ICN. Everything is good, professional and spotless. The ticket is quite expensive but worth it. Will fly this again for sure. Good meal and In-flight entertainment.",,,,,
" Seoul to Hồ Chí Minh with Asiana Airlines. Overall excellent flight. Cabin crews were extremely friendly, professional and really cared about you. The food (Korean mixed rice) was very tasty. This is the 6th time I have flown with Asiana Airlines and I will always support this carrier.",,,,,
 Manila to Chicago via Seoul. Ground crew in Manila are approachable and knowledgeable. The flight crew from Seoul to Chicago are efficient but I noticed that they don't often serve juices/drinks during the midflight especially when the lights are dimmed. You need to call their attention if you need drinks.,,,,,
"  Seoul to Singapore. I am appalled that with a 2 year old daughter we were not given the priority to board first. This resulted us bashing through the seats with passengers already settled down, especially those by the aisles as my belongings might have hit you while I navigated through the chaotic cabin. I sincerely apologised for the unwanted encounter. ",,,,,
  Seoul to Beijing. Disappointing flight crew. Very nice but not assertive in getting bags in the overhead. They would repeatedly allow passengers who objected to bags being reorganize prevail causing our already late flight to be further delayed. ,,,,,
"  Kansai to London via Incheon. Disgraceful bag drop scenes at Kansai airport, even having checked-in online and printed our boarding passes - 50 minute queue with only four bag-drop desks open for two flights. New, quiet aircraft with comfortable seats. Service adequate, food poor. No alcohol on first flight from KIX-ICN, only offered one glass of wine on the flight from Incheon to London. Entertainment system quite good with some good recent films. Smooth bag drop at Heathrow T2 for return journey. Same issues with food and alcohol. All flights landed more or less on time.",,,,,
"  I actually cannot review the flight because I did have to cancel my ticket but I had such an amazing experience with their customer service I had to review them. Also I immediately booked a new flight through them so I can update this next month when I do fly.  I am not sure if this is the best airline or I was given special treatment because of my situation. Although, this must happen to people all the time. The trip I was planning for a year was ripped away from me the weekend before I leave. I was devastated. Asiana really tried to work with us to change our plans but still leave the same time we were supposed to (although that fell through to, you need a permit for specific medications) long story short I had to cancel all together. They say refunds take 2-4 weeks and I needed the money to book new tickets so I was really hoping it would come in two weeks but it came in 1! They were just nothing but nice and helpful. No crazy fees or anything. I truly love this airline! I felt the really cared for me or at least about my experience with them.",,,,,
" Great experience from start to finish. Check-in agent very polite and efficient. Priority given for security checks. They use the Air New Zealand lounge, great one with lots of food and beverage choices, great seating spaces. Boarding a bit late due to weather conditions at SYD airport. Once on board the A380 feels spacious and very comfy. FA's are great, they give a superb infligth experience. The only thing that needs to be improved is the IFE, not a big selection of movies. Food and wine selection great for business class. The korean meal experience, if you choose to try it, is really good. Seat comfy and lots of space around. Overall a great experience and got in a taxi short 30 mins after arrival.",,,,,
"  Seoul to Jakarta. Quite attentive service, One of the friendliest and most courteous stewardesses. Plane seemed a bit old. Their screen is old and definitely need upgrade. Food quality is amazing.",,,,,
"  Hong Kong to Incheon. I have been a loyal Diamond member of Asiana Airlines for many years. I believe Asiana's strategy was to sell front and exit row to compete with rising LLCs. This time, I travelled with my wife and my 9 month old daughter. The 3 of us are already registered as family members. When we arrived at Hong Kong airport counter, the ground staff gave us the middle row about 6-7 rows from the front. I asked if we could get the front row with bassinet seat, but the staff says the seats are for sale, and the staff was kind enough to share that no one paid extra to get the front row and unless I pay extra for it, the plane will fly with the front row empty.  As the staff said, the plane took off with the front row empty. We asked the flight crews if we could move to the front row, but they said they couldn't help due to the internal policy. When I landed, I called the customer service asking to speak to the person in charge. Apparently, there is no channel to speak to the responsible person directly. I can only fill in the ""Customer's Voice"" page on the website - which I have done a few times prior to this incident, but emails that seem auto-generated were returned to my inbox. Asiana seems intentional with shutting down communication channels with the customers as they know there will be frequent complaints from loyalty customers as they lowered their service quality.",,,,,
"  Sydney to London return via Seoul over the Christmas period. Outbound flight into Seoul does not connect to London, meaning an overnight stay is required. We made a two night city break of it. All four flights were on time. Good standard of customer service throughout flights and meals were acceptable. Seats reasonably comfortable with plenty of legroom (I am over 6 foot). Quite a limited selection of IFE movies and music (do these things really cost airlines so much?!). A380 and A350 aircraft were both modern, especially the A350. Website and online check-in not very user-friendly.",,,,,
"  Singapore to Seoul Incheon. First time flying with Asiana Airlines. Overall quite happy with my flight with them. Quite attentive service with the rare soft skill that many airline crews (Western) are lacking. One of the friendliest and most courteous stewardesses I've seen. Plane seemed a bit old, not completely certain though. Their screen is not a touch-screen. The visuals at first were rather poor, but later it got better. Not sure if it was because of the angle, sun light, or perhaps another reason that at the beginning I barely could see anything at the screen. Food quality is at pair with other major Asian airliners. Where OZ stands out is at their on-board service. Definitely flying with them again.",,,,,
" Seoul to Shanghai. Asiana Airlines check in counter is located at Seoul Incheon International Airport Terminal 1. A ground staff approached me when I attempted to check in at the kiosk. However, the check in process wasn't successful and therefore I have to proceed to the check in counter for this purpose. Unlike certain airlines which charge for seat with extra legroom, I requested for a emergency exit row and was granted. Boarding call in English, Chinese and Korean laguage was made approximately 40 minutes before departure. Two row are assigned for this purpose. Special need passengers and elite frequent flyer member are given priority boarding. An A321-200 with 2 class of configuration is deployed for this flight. All seats are fitted with in flight entertainment. Passengers can select movies, music on demand as well as live flight path at theirs own convenience. Cabin crew are extremely friendly and courteous. A Chinese speaking crew is assigned for this flight. Flight OZ367 departed on time. In flight meal was served approximately 20 minutes after take off. Passengers were offered with two choices of dinner. In the mean time, hot and cold beverages including alcoholic drink were also served, The professionalism of the cabin crew is without doubts when comes into the efficiency of distribution of meal. This flight will not be smooth and comfortable without theirs' dedication and hardwork.",,,,,
"  Shanghai Pudong to Seoul. The check in process was extremely efficient. Boarding priority given to passengers with special needs, business class as well as elite frequent flyer member. The cabin crew were at the door of the aircraft to guide passengers to seats. Asiana Airlines is renowned for its high quality of service. The professionalism of the flight attendant can be seen from the politeness and hospitality. Communication is at ease as they speak good English. A330-300 is equipped with the newer generation of Inflight Entertainment with the larger touch screen IFE. In flight meal was served approximately half an hour after take off, packed in a snack box. Besides that, hot and cold beverages were also served. The in flight catering was tasty.",,,,,
"  Fantastic Crew from Frankfurt to Seoul. From Seoul to Frankfurt (December 20) was also very pleasant, but I especially enjoyed the cabin crew from Frankfurt to Seoul on January 2nd. Food was good and sufficient, plenty of drink offers. Baby food was plenty and perfect (I could save some for throughout the flight to have my son fed and quiet when I needed to). Very friendly, experienced crew with bright smiles even after the journey. That's how it should be.",,,,,
"  London to Manila via Seoul. I was impressed with Asiana from the start, being able to check in luggage some 6 hours before the flight from Heathrow meant i was able to go into departures and wait there. 23kg allowance was also welcome. Boarding process was a little different with no row numbers being used to speed up the process. Just form a line then go. Even in economy the seat was ok comfort wise with adequate legroom. Aircraft has a 3-3-3 layout so if you like to walk about during the flight the aisle seats are the best option. Cabin crew were welcoming and friendly although the English speaking skills were not particularly good. As this was a mid evening departure the drinks/food service started soon after take off with a western or Korean option being offered. I took the western option and it was good. No water was given as part of the meal though. Crew did make regular trips with water and juice during the flight. Before arrival a snack was served again it was good. IFE was adequate with a limited choice on offer when compared to other airlines. Arrived in Seoul and found the transfer process to be very easy. Had a 2 hour wait here before onward flight. Boarding was again a bit chaotic with just a long line rather than row numbers. Crew were welcoming but the A330 was looking its age. Seat comfort /Legroom and IFE were of a lessor standard but ok for a flight of this length. Once again a meal was served which was good.",,,,,
"  Seoul to Los Angeles. This is my 9th time flying business class with Asiana Airlines. But during this last flight, I didn’t feel like I flown a business class seat.  Only 2 washrooms were available for business class passengers which were small, the 3rd washroom was for FA staff use only! The meal service was very slow. Dinner service took them almost 2 hours to finish due to the fact they only had 2 FAs for the whole business class section - (20 passengers) the FA forgot my wine, a spoon a couple of times. The crew manager went around, but didn’t actually introduce himself, and thanked the passengers one by one. They saw me awake during the flight when they were making rounds, but didn’t bother asking if I wanted a snack or anything. The amenity kit has changed and it looked really cheap!",,,,,
"  Seoul to Manila, a 3.5 hr flight. The A330-300 was archaic, horrible 1st generation shell seats. This is the same seat that is on the Boeing 747-400, simply awful, narrow making it impossible to sleep on your side. IFE was virtually non-existent. Food was marginal. Service was okay.",,,,,
" Seoul Incheon to Los Angeles. I bought the tickets from Asiana to be on the A380 with double deck, but was put in a much smaller aircraft single deck. For the 12 hours flight this was the most uncomfortable, seats are to be upright to be having food; there were no rooms for legs, etc. For a long flight, not able to choose the movies was bad too, they were preset movie channels so you could not watch anything at the beginning, and switching channels for the movie you want not able to see the titles.",,,,,
  Singapore to Seoul Incheon. Its our first time flying with Asiana Airlines since we got a good deal from their seat sale for Autumn in Korea. We are very pleased with the service. Everything is hassle free. Will definitely fly again with them.,,,,,
"  First time flying Asiana. I used 140,000 miles from My United/Chase credit card to get this flight. Though not my first time flying First Class it was my first time flying in a private suite. From the check to the exiting at Seoul Incheon everything was so perfect. My seat was huge and super comfortable. Meals service began with a couple of glasses of Winston Churchill Champagne and a delightful serving of caviar. The man in course wS a five or six dish Korean meal - bibim bap. I had a glass or two of an excellent Bordeaux - they were small glasses. Dessert was served and I had some lovely vintage port. I must add the table was set with white cloth and red rose. The table was huge with ample room for all the utensils and plates. The service from the flight attendant was just lovely - attentive without being over servile. The provided pajamas and the amenities were of the highest quality. The bed was super comfortable and very easy to sleep in.  Best flight of my life.",,,,,
"  Seoul tp Phuket return. I had thoroughly enjoyed my flight on their A350 from London, so was looking forward to my flights to Phuket. On this route it was an A330, 2x2x2 layout. The cabin was half full. The seating was OK, but looked more like ugly pods and rather old fashioned. The seat controls were confusing, but I did manage the sleeping position. Being 6 hour night flights, I was also able to get a couple of hours sleep both ways. The flight attendants were courteous, but the service was rushed. The dining was disappointing. Dinner on the way out, but breakfast on the way back, at 11pm at night! Both were hurried, and did not see the crew until landing time when they came around with hot towels. On both flights, I requested a pre dinner aperitif, but it was served with the meal, the wine, the desert all on one tray (except the main course)! On my return flight I asked again for my pre dinner drink to be served before the meal, which was noted with a smile, but again came with everything on one tray. I don't know whether there was specific reason for this, as on the London route, food served was a proper dining experience. Still, the food was tasty, yet with only one item for desert. The IFE was useless, kept cutting off and manipulating it was frustrating. Uneventful, but comfortable flights, nothing to shout about, expect to say Asiana could update their A330 seating and dining service.",,,,,
"  Seoul to London. On boarding, there was some confusion, as the signage for economy and business class were not easily visible. So there was a constant moving of passenger to the right queue. My seat 2K was window (1x2x1 layout), giving some privacy and plenty of space. The cabin looked new and spacious, especially as the A350 does not have the hand luggage storage in the middle. I was welcomed with pre flight drinks including Champagne, followed by hot towel. Ten minutes after take off flight attendants came around taking drinks and dinner orders. The menu was - Western and Korean cuisine. I opted for the Bibimbap meal - a traditional meal of rice with accompaniments and soup, which was absolutely delicious. I am not too keen on sweets, so followed up with a cheeseboard. Later coffee and cognac. The service was unhurried, and well timed serving each course. A couple of hours before landing, a snack was served - actually quite substantial, again the attendants coming around to take your order. Super efficient, polite, yet not chatty or engaging. However, at the end of the flight I was asked if I enjoyed it, which nice little touch. My return flight was equally enjoyable. And in-between meals the flight attendants would come around asking if you wanted anything else such as drinks and snacks including noodle soup. The IFE was very limited, and although the movie selection was tiny, it did have a couple of the latest movies. The touch screen worked well. The Amenity Kit was OK but nothing special. Slippers were provided in pouches. My only slight complain was the actual seat. The controls were very easy to use. There was the standard seat belt plus shoulder strap (not sure the technical reason for this). It was comfortable for sitting, but quite hard for sleeping. I expected a larger pillow and thin mattress to be provided. So I did not get a good nights sleep. While my flights were 4 Star rating to perfection, I did not feel I was getting a 5 Star service.",,,,,
"  Seoul Incheon to Beijing. The queuing process and check in process for flight OZ333 was quick and smooth quick. This flight was operated by Asiana A330-300. Over the years, south Korea has successfully branded as a duty free shopping destination. As this flight is bound for China, There were number of passengers who collected theirs' duty free item at Seoul Incheon International Airport counter. Prior to boarding, announcement was made to inform passengers to have large carry on luggage weighted in order to comply with the safety regulations. Asiana Airlines is renowned for its excellent service. Boarding process was done row by row, priority given to special needs passengers. Cabin crew on duty are professionally trained as well. As a polite gesture, they greeted me warmly once I boarded and assisted me to our seat. Flight OZ 333 departed on time. The cabin of this aircraft is clean despite there are sign of ageing noted. The in flight meal is fine, though there is room for improvement. As this is a short flight, snack box was served with 2 choices of Korean delicacies. This aircraft is fitted with the old In flight entertainment (IFE). The number of movies and music selection is rather limited. Asiana should consider enhancing the IFE with higher density (HD) screen and adding number of choice of entertainment into the IFE. I would conclude overall experience is pleasant one.",,,,,
" Shanghai Pudong to Seoul Incheon. I arrived at Shanghai Pudong International Airport and proceed to Asiana Airlines counter for check in. The queue was relatively short and the check in process was prompt. Upon check in, I was informed that OZ 364 which was originally schedule for departure at 13:10 was delayed until 16:00 due to bad weather in Seoul. I was given a generous meal voucher of 90 Chinese yuan to have my lunch at the airport. After lunch, I proceed to with the security and immigration process. As a result of unforeseen circumstances, I had plenty of time at the airport. Upon reaching the assigned gate, the ground staff told me that the aircraft was further delayed until 1850 due to heavy rain in Seoul Incheon. A new gate has been re assigned for this flight. When I reached the said gate, ground staff were seen busy assisting passengers while distribute meal box to fill our hunger and quench thirst. At the same time, they apologised for such delay. Boarding announcement was called around 18:30, as soon as the aircraft arrived in Shanghai Pudong International Airport. A bus was used to transfer us to the aircraft was it was parked at the remote parking slot. Boarding was relatively swift. The cabin crew and captain made an apology while awaiting for the taxi clearance from the airport control tower. In flight dinner and beverages were promptly served approximately 20 minutes after take off. Asiana Airlines cabin crew are well trained to handle our request. The standard of the in flight catering was fine but can be further improved. What truly impressed me was the hospitality and attention given by the flight attendant through out the entire journey. I shall certainly fly Asiana Airlines again in the future.",,,,,
"  Bangkok to Los Angeles via Seoul. Flight attendants are very attentive. Comfortable cabin and seat. Food from LAX to ICN was excellent. Food for ICN-BKK both ways were fine. However food from ICN to LAX included only chicken breast and Ssambap. Movie selection was quite limited, Asian movies are subtitled in Korean only so English-speaking passengers cannot enjoy them.",,,,,
"  This is the worst business class trip I have taken. Flight delayed by 2 hours. When we take off no proper catering options, just given a tray of unrecognisable western dish (chicken?) and then asked if want to order the dinner meal before arrival - a choice of scrambled egg or porridge -  who eats breakfast for dinner? Staff were polite but the cabin was too hot and the entertainment selection is appalling.",,,,,
" Los Angeles to Manila via Incheon. My experience with Asiana Airlines is not as exciting as I thought it would be. At LAX, boarding was chaotic. They don't have an organized boarding system. Everybody rushed in to board no matter what your seat number is. I found this to be very frustrating. The service is pretty much comparable to other premier Asian carriers. The economy seats are quite similar as well, although it has more cushion and softer. The B777 aircraft is an older version enroute to Seoul. The food is ok, not great as I was expecting. In my opinion they should just serve the Bibimbap enroute to Seoul and something different should be served in between Seoul and Manila and Seoul to LAX. That kind of explains why they have toothbrushes and mouthwash in the lavatories. While on transit in Seoul, the seats in the boarding gates are so stiff. I looked around for better seats to rest and I couldn't find any. The room is also small that there aren't enough seats for everybody. Some passengers just stood and wait for the next flight. Upon boarding, everybody rushed in again without any order. There still is no systematic boarding, unlike China Southern, EVA Airways, Cathay Pacific and Air China. Because of this, I promised myself not to book future flights with Asiana. The B747 for the connecting flight was refreshing as it is wider than the B777 and the seats are more comfortable. It was also quite nostalgic to board a B747. My flights were quite smooth, except for the hour delay from Seoul to MNL.",,,,,
"  Sydney to Istanbul via Seoul. Wonderful staff and even though it was an older plane the seat was comfortable with good legroom. Unfortunately, the entertainment choices were limited and the equipment was poor and old. Luckily, the Korean films were very entertaining and had English subtitles because none of the other world movies did. The plane was delayed one hour on the runway in Sydney, whilst they waited for the meals and again when a passenger didnt feel well. However, we made up the time in the air. The Sydney to Incheon leg was a day flight leaving in the morning, however the blinds were closed for the 9 hour trip. The same happened from Incheon to Istanbul, again a day flight of 9 hours, so it was quite stuffy particularly because the cabin temperature was warm. I preferred the excellent Korean food over the western meal and kept hydrated with tonnes of water rather than trying their alcohol. All flights were full but the staff were exemplary; remaining patient and smiling. The toilets were surprisingly always clean and in order.",,,,,
"  New York to Bangkok via Seoul. Both Sections were on A380. First the good news, planes were immaculately clean, staff were superb throughout, food was great on first leg, not so good on BKK section. Both planes were delayed, we had received notification that the JFK to ICN flight times had changed, about one hour later departure, but we left about another one after this this. It appears that OZ221 is always late leaving JFK, its not the airport issue as the KE ( a380 ) seems to leave on time every day around the same time. Connection at ICN was tight, but the plane was delayed once we had boarded. Food option poor only two choices on ICN to BKK, no Korean option! Movie choice on ICN to BKK poor only 4 Hollywood movies. The price was keen and would use again.",,,,,
"  Hong Kong to Jeju via Seoul return. Comfortable flights and good for cost per performance.  The inflight meal was good quality and FAs served for passengers politely. For the return flights, when I checked-in at CJU, I could through check-in to HKG and no need to pick-up checked luggage at GMP even though my connecting flights depart at ICN. Checked luggage was sent to HKG automatically so I was so comfortable to move from GMP to ICN without any carries!",,,,,
"  Seoul to Saipan. Excellent service, the flight attendants were very nice. A wonderful flight. Asiana Airlines  will definitely be my first choice.",,,,,
" Flew Sydney to London via Seoul and return in economy. After reading many reviews about Asiana I thought I'd fly with them this time back to the UK but after this time, I won't bother again. It's not that they're bad but SIA and Cathay Pacific are so much better. The food was nothing special and rather odd in texture, the entertainment system was old with poor response from the touch screen and very limited choice of movies. I don't sleep well on flights so usually spend a lot of time watching movies, I didn't finish one. Baggage allowance was a measly 20kg. Not that I expect to travel with all my household furnishings but I'd like to travel and not worry I'm going to go over my weight allowance. On the outbound flight from Sydney my wife was asleep so I ate her snack, my bad. After she woke up I went to see if I could get her another one. That was a no as she already 'had' her allocated snack. With Cathay, just in the crew area they have bowls of fruit and other snacks that you can help yourself to. Want something hot, no bother with CX, have some noodles. An annoying thing when you're trying to sleep is that whenever we hit turbulence the screen would light up. I don't understand Korean and maybe it's something to do with the Korean language but you'd get these long announcements but in English it ends up garbled and very brief. Does Korean use more to say less? I'm Asian myself and can understand that many Asians have trouble with the English language but considering English is the language all airlines are supposed to use the standard was poor and I missed more than I actually caught. I suppose you get what you pay for and they where at the cheaper end of the price scale but still, it's the little things that add up to make it a less than an experience I'd want to repeat.",,,,,
"  Okinawa to Los Angeles via Seoul. You can't reschedule one leg of a journey to a time after the second leg. I spent over an hour finding someone who would correct my flight schedule, which they did by adding an extra leg. That followed up with 6 + 4 hours of delays, missing on my last leg which they refused to rebook on another partner airline that was leaving sooner. All in all, a 16-20 hour trip turned into a 36 hour ordeal and nothing from the airline for all meals bought and hotels stayed at. Pretty sure I'm not going to use this airline again.",,,,,
"  First time in Asiana Business Class on flight from Hong Kong to Seoul. Asiana's business class seats are in a staggered 1-2-1 configuration on the A380. The seats could be turned into a flat bed and were very comfortable, in particular considering that it was only a three-hour-flight. Service was friendly and very efficient, and the quality of the food was impressive for a rather short flight. I would take Asiana again without hesitation.",,,,,
 Flew Asiana Airlines from Seoul to London. Staff were more interested in chatting in the kitchen area than helping the passengers and made you wait when you asked for something. Food was very ordinary so I skipped the second meal and entertainment is limited. On the plus side the seats are individual ones next to the window and are quite big and flat.,,,,,
" During the flight, a huge majority of the passengers as well as most, if all not, of the cabin crew were Koreans. Except from the announcements (turbulence, arriving message, etc) played over the PA system, all other announcements (asking if anyone wanted extra servings of beverages or had rubbish for throwing, etc) relayed by the flight attendants face-to-face were done in the Korean language only. No efforts were made by the cabin crew to engage non-Korean speaking passengers, as they seemed to have forgotten that there were passengers of other nationalities on board. In this aspect, Korean Air fared far better.",,,,,
"  Seoul Gimpo to Jeju. The flight that I booked was delay and I have been offered from the ground staff to take a previous flight, I have been positively surprised. Ground staff did a great job, they worked hard and they were very busy to minimize the delay. I loved that the cabin crew greets and welcome every single passenger after the boarding, cabin crew were amazing. Cabin is clean, seat is comfortable, and a drink service has been offered. I will fly again Asiana Airlines.",,,,,
"  Seoul to Shanghai. At the boarding gate airline members carried out an accurate weight and size-inspection of carry on luggage.  Seats were comfortable enough for this 2-hour-flight. In flight entertainment selection is mediocre. Flight attendants are very strict with drinks being brought into the cabin. I carried a beverage which I bought in the departure hall, when they caught me sipping at it they requested me to give it up and started making a fuss over it. Meals were served during the short flight, quality was acceptable. Considering the bargain ticket a recommendable airline.",,,,,
"  Seoul Incheon to Jakarta. I was highly impressed by the service provided by the air crew. Their response was very good. Aircraft was much comfortable affordable and food was also good especially arrange as I wanted Muslim food. I have travelled through Emirates, Qatar and Thai previously, however, I found this airline above all. Overall a great experience.",,,,,
 Took OZ754 from Singapore to Seoul and was assigned a flight without any personal in-flight entertainment! I am very surprised at this. Service was so-so. Food portion and taste was also ok. The only good thing is that the leg room is wider. I will not consider taking Asiana again for my next Korea trip.,,,,,
 Haneda-Gimpo-Haneda on Asiana's A330. The aircrafts were a little old but no problem for this 2-hour flight. Seats were okay. PTVs were also okay but a little difficult to navigate. Meals were good for this short flight. Flight attendants were friendly and professional.,,,,,
"  Seoul to Los Angeles. This was just one leg of our trip which was Los Angeles to Sydney return. However all legs were excellent. We had the same seats for all our flights and the same aircraft as well, the A380. We were in 9E and 9F. Embarkation was smooth and awe were warmly greeted as we arrived to the aircraft and directed to our seats. The FA's were all very polite and professional and friendly. The lie flat quadra-smartium seats were fine though I do think they could provide a duvet for extra padding. However we slept well. The food was very good and the selection of wine, beer and spirits was quite good. I like a Scotch and they had an 18 yr old Chivas Regal or a 17 yr old Ballantine's and the cognac was a camp XO, very good! The IFE was fine and we had plenty of movies and other programming to choose from. Most importantly its the high level of professionalism displayed on board by the staff that really sells it for me. I am treated like a most welcome guest.",,,,,
"  Seoul Incheon to London. This was my first flight with Asiana Airlines, which I took after having checked it had the new business class. It was an excellent flight. Configuration is 1-2-1. Seats are wider than on British Airways and there's pretty good storage. Service was excellent, food was good. WiFi worked perfectly. Small quibble but movies were mostly poor quality (ie poorly reviewed) and not as extensive as the best systems. All in all, an excellent trip, and I’d be very happy to fly them again, with the new business class.",,,,,
"  Avoid Asiana's Honolulu-Incheon route. Super old aircraft with a six inches IFE screen. Very limited entertainment, around 10 movies in total that you don't even want to watch because the screen is small and old. I don't understand why Asiana will deploy an old aircraft with limited entertainment for a long haul flight. Please use these old aircrafts for short hauls. The only saving grace was the food! Delicious and more than enough in terms of quantity. Two full meals for a 9-hour flight.",,,,,
"  Chicago to Ho Chi Minh City via Seoul. Flight with Asiana Airlines was very comfortable with great service and inflight food. My flight was overnight and allowed me to sleep on my normal schedule and arrive refreshed. I will definitely add this to my list of preferred airlines. Seats are spaced for great leg room and the seat width is comfortable for a 6 foot, 240 pound man.",,,,,
"  Seoul to Singapore. My friend and I packed some snacks and drinks on the flight and while settling down in our seats are so inconvenient as there are other passengers walking along the aisle. Cabin staff took initiative to help us hold on to our food as we are putting our carry-on luggage at the overhead cabinet and waited patiently till we’re done with putting our carry on luggage. Throughout the flight she smiled while serving food, drinks or even just walking down the aisle. Hoping that this compliment will reach her so that she could keep up her good work. However the downside of the seat is the legroom is too small for my legs if there’s wider legroom it would be more comfortable. Nonetheless, I would fly Asiana Airlines again if I ever have a chance to visit Korea again.",,,,,
" Food wise, it was bleah to meh but palatable. The FA were quite fast to attend to general request. The IFE screen was small and the selection of movies was meagre but with the small screen with poor resolution, my handphone (Samsung Note 3) provided better entertainment if I wanted to use it. I pre-ordered an item for Duty Free purchase for my wife on the prior flight and supposed to collect it on this flight. However, they said there was a mistake made by the FA on the prior flight who helped make our pre-order. The response that I got was: ""please call us when you reach your destination and we will sort it out."" What? Call? I told them they should try to rectify it on their end and when we disembark. Why aren't the FA trained properly? It could have been better managed!",,,,,
"  Flew Los Angeles to Beijing via Incheon on Asiana, Flight 203-231, returned via Shanghai Pudong to LA via ICN on Asiana 362-204, on September 11-27. Flight out from LA was about an hour late departing. Ticketing/baggage check at LAX pretty hectic. Flew A380 upper deck economy on LA to Incheon, row 75. Upper deck Economy on Asiana is 2-4-2. Had window and aisle seat, large storage compartment next to window. Legroom was just average. Asiana does not offer a premium economy, but charges $100 extra for some bulkhead rows with extra legroom. Service was friendly and efficient. Korean food option was very good. Inflight entertainment was comprehensive with US, Korean and world movie/TV options. ICN to Beijing leg was scheduled to be an A330, but they substituted an A321 that was only half full. Two hour flight departed and arrived on-time. It was uneventful, and was served a breakfast with a choice of western or Chinese food. The return from Shanghai Pudong was on a packed new A350. Seating was 3-3-3 and the first 4 or 5 rows in economy had a couple of extra inches of legroom, for $150 extra. Since it was less than a 2 hour flight I chose not to pay extra. The A350 had seatback entertainment system with a full compliment of movies and TV from both US and Asian sources. We were served a warm lunch, again with western or Asian food choices. We stayed over for 2 nights in Seoul before returning to LA on Asiana flight 204. Check-in at Incheon went very smoothly, using a self check terminal to generate a boarding pass and then dropping our bags. At bag check, the Asiana clerk gave us a pass to use expedited customs clearance. It was very short line, and customs and security took less than 5 minutes. The Seoul to LA leg was again in an A380. This time we sat in the main cabin which is 3-4-3 arrangement. We chose the centre section, so you are only 1 seat away from the aisle. Again, the food options were Korean or western and we chose the Korean option which was very good. I find the Asiana flight attendants to be excellent, friendly and helpful. We ordered wine with dinner, and in a vain attempt to sleep on the flight we asked for a second glass of wine. The flight attendant brought our second glass and several snack packets for both of us. I have heard some complain about hard seats on Asiana's A380's. I'm not sure that they are any worse than the economy seats on any airline. Frankly, in my opinion, spending 10-12 hours in any economy seat is tiring on my behind. Overall, Asiana is not quite at the standards of Singapore or EVA, but they are far, far better than any US flagged carrier, at least in Economy.",,,,,
" Asiana Airlines is currently operating its latest A350-900 from Shanghai Pudong to Seoul Incheon until end of October 2017. I am pleased to be on board this brand new aircraft on this short haul flight. I arrived 2 hours prior to the flight departure. Check in is prompt and smooth. Flight OZ362 departed slightly behind schedule due to delay from the incoming flight and also air traffic control. Boarding call is made half an hour prior to departure. Once I boarded, the flight attendant guided me to the assigned seat. Cabin crew were busy distributing blanket and assisting passenger while awaiting for clearance for take off. Since this is a new aircraft, the cleanliness of this aircraft is a plus. This brand new aircraft is quiet during taxied off, take off and landing. I am truly amazed me with professionalism of the cabin crew despite that this is a 2 hours flight. In flight meal was served as soon as the seat belt sign had been turned off. They were always on the aisle to ensure that passengers were well taken care throughout the journey. Nonetheless, the choice of inflight entertainment is rather limited compare to other airlines I had flown. As such, I would propose Asiana consider adding more. Similarly, Asiana should look into way to improve the cabin crew English proficiency. The overall flying experience is beyond my expectation. I look forward to fly with Asiana Airlines again in the near future.",,,,,
"  Los Angeles to Hong Kong via  Seoul. Los Angeles to Seoul Incheon was a solid experience. Since it was an red-eye flight the catering was below average. Everything was oily, however the tea selections after the meal was a delight. CAs need to learn how to behave in the galley when passengers are sleeping. I sat three rows in front of the galley and I literally thought there was a mariachi band behind me. Overall the inflight service was decent.",,,,,
"  Manila to Seattle via Seoul Incheon on A350 and B777. A350 is quite new and their Boeing 777 seems old. Food services are really excellent! They are constantly offering drinks during the entire flight. Wide variety of drink options. Leg room are very decent for an Economy Class. However, AVOD is limited and they should have more options. Overall experience is good. Will definitely choose Asiana again when flying Long Haul to USA.",,,,,
" Old Asiana Boeing 767 aircraft from Taipei to Seoul, which many of the amenities available on most planes today, are not available. However, plane was clean, so was the lavatory. Service was average, but the crew seem to be rushing through the service. Food came in a box, but it was hot and relatively tasty. Airport ground crews were friendly and very helpful.",,,,,
" My trip wasn’t planned, it was a last minute thing, had to find a flight going to Bangui in 2 days, only flight available was ASKY, 5 years ago had a horrible experience with ASKY but had no choice but to fly them. Going to Bangui flight was good, flight attendants were great, joyful, easy to talk to, good manners and helpful, I was shocked and surprised but in a good way. Bangui to Lome flight, KP 035 was terrible, same bad experience all back, flight attendants super nasty, bad attitude, bad service, impolite, miserable people. They need to go back to learn how to react with customers! Don’t bring your bad mood to your job! People on the plane are paying customers, they deserve respect. ASKY should do better! ",,,,,
"  Both Ethiopian Airlines and Asky Airlines have failed to deliver the services that I paid for. Asky Airlines canceled our flights as we stood at the airport without a single announcement being made. We did not receive an explanation as to why the flight was cancelled and we're provided different explanations from every single person that we spoke with from the airline. I emailed Asky regarding the cause of the cancellation and have yet to receive a response from anyone. Since I had booked my flight directly through Ethiopian Airlines, I called their customer support and somehow the Ethiopian Airlines rep was also unable to get any feedback from Asky Airlines. How is it possible for Ethiopian Airlines to be a strategic partner to Asky Airlines and not know when there's disruptions with their connecting flights or be able to communicate adequately between the two airlines. Even worst, when Asky Airlines tried to reschedule us for the next flight, they went through the entire process of rebooking and generating boarding passes only to come back and tell my wife and I that the plane was full for our rescheduled flights. So after several hours of waiting in Accra Airport we were forced to stay an extra day for the next available flight back to the US. It gets even worst, because the final destination for our new flight is in a different location in the US since the airline doesn't seem to be able to find any other flight options. So now not only do I have the cost of losing a day of travel, but I also have the cost of having to book another flight from the new destination in order to get home. This is absurd!  When my wife and I booked with Ethiopian and Asky Airlines, we thought we would give them a chance to prove themselves despite all of the negative reviews that we had read online. We have learned our lesson and will never fly with either of these airlines again. ",,,,,
"  My flight got canceled without any notice and they did not care at all or even apologize. They changed my itinerary and refused to pick up my call on their so call called WhatsApp call Center. This is the worst airline ever, please do not fly with them ever! They have no respect for their clients",,,,,
"  Flight was supposed to depart around 10:45 morning apparently the crew was not available and it got delayed by 2hrs. Once the crew arrived they started boarding the flight and after few mins of boarding completion the flight was about to take off they once again returned back. The captain kept us waiting and after 1hr, captain announced everyone must disembark the flight. So during this process nor the captain or Asky management team didn't even turn back to apologise the passenger and no information about alternate arrangement. Their service is outrageous.",,,,,
"  This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. I made a transit from Lome to Accra. Dirty, old plane. I was afraid to touch anything onboard. Got to Accra and all 3 of my luggages were missing. 2 came two days later and now with over a week of going to the airport everyday to check, my last luggage is still missing. The company doesn't have anything on their site to report this. The airline service desk at the airport was no help at all. Still haven't heard from them. ",,,,,
"  Check in with rude staff. Boarding chaotic. On board the food served was utterly inedible - stale bread. Inadequate drink selection. Dirty aircraft, despite it not being that old. Rude cabin staff. Uncomfortable business class seat. Only positive was good ground handling of business class passengers on arrival in Lome.",,,,,
 Very Terrible Experience. I flew with Business Class but yet my luggage did not arrive. Have tried to call the ASKY office but cannot get information. No official communication has been made as to when we will get our luggage. Will never consider flying ASKY again if had an alternative.,,,,,
"  I flew to Lome from Johannesburg. When l got my bag at arrival in Lome, the luggage wrapping was removed and my bag was damaged. I reported to Asky offices and they requested that I give them my empty luggage for investigating, which I did. They promised to give my feedback before I return as I was in Lome for a week. They never called back. I had to buy another suitcase. I have sent numbers of mails still no response except to acknowledge my query. The staff on board was rude to me, ne got so upset with me for asking her to give me a 2nd cup of tea.",,,,,
"  Very disappointing, they are not reliable enough when it comes to luggage management. When checking it from Libreville to Johannesburg i had to take a connection flight from Lome, same airline but they couldn't check the luggage to Johannesburg. I have been instructed to collect the luggage from Lome and check in again to Johannesburg. When arrive in Lome access was dined by immigration visa was required. I reported to the Asky agent in Lome and advised all in order my luggage was sent Johannesburg. Then when I arrived in Johannesburg no luggage was found and was lost in Lome. I had to book a hotel for the weekend as i couldn't do my job without the luggage. I was very unhappy the way Asky handled this issue as i emphasized my luggage was a priority",,,,,
"  We left Johannesburg for Lagos on the 22nd of December 2019 and the flight supposed to leave at 3.30am and we ended up leaving 6am, which was not a problem to many of us, but the problem is getting to our destination. All our bags that was wrapped was unwrap and almost everyone in the flight was complained of same thing. My bags and my friend bags was damaged and took a lot of things inside them.",,,,,
"  Johannesburg to Lagos. I flew with Virgin from Sydney to Perth, then South African Airlines to Johannesburg, was there a few days and finally Asky to Lagos. I had been coming with the same baggage from Sydney. ASKY had an issue with my hand luggage stating its too big and there was no space for it on board. I agreed to check it in with my other luggage only to get to Lagos and not find my luggage. The only response I got from their customer service was that, “its a daily flight, we will bring it tomorrow”. No apology. Meanwhile I don’t live in Lagos, So I had spend extra time and money plus stress to sort out accommodation for that night.",,,,,
"  Lome to Accra. Reported lost baggage since July 31. No response till now. Several reminders have not proven any result. Connected with Asky Airlines thru United Airlines at Boston and Ethiopian Airlines at Newark, USA b4 taking Askty at Lome,Togo. This is bad customer service. I won't recommend this airline to anybody.",,,,,
"  Kinshasa to Lome via Abidjan / Niamey. I wrote what's below while I was still in the aircraft, and I waited until know to see if I wrote it out of anger and if I would want to change it but I don't want to change anything. I would add more but I think will drive my point across. The minimum for an airline to do, is to inform them of delays when they occur. In Niamey, December 18, 2018, a group of customers including myself spent more than 6 hours at the airport not knowing if the flight that was originally scheduled at 8:45 am, and then at 11:45 am has been postponed or not. It is at the last minute, when about to board, that we learn that we do not have seats. The airplane is full capacity. Only some, 4 to 5 people, were still able to take off that day. The representatives on site have not offered passengers explanations or even a bottle of water. The next day again convened at 6:00 am, but with an explained delay, we took off around 10:00 am. Again ASKY through its representatives did not have the decency to inform passengers that there was a delay. In Lome, in transit, the flight is late again. There was no announcement, and I went to the counter, staff told me that there is a delay, obviously, and that she does not know anything else and that I only have to wait. I was furious against myself having thought that by taking Asky I would participate and support Pan-Africanism and its company. It may be an insignificant number but I and those with whom I have lived this adventure will think several times before taking Asky again; not because of the delay, it happens, but the lack of respect of the traveler.",,,,,
"  Airport was clean, staff competent, was moved through quickly. Asky Airport office I found most helpful - my flight was changed without any hassles. The flight was 25 mins, staff competent, good take off and landing. I would definitely fly this route with them again.",,,,,
"  While in transit from Lome to Abuja on the 10th September, we boarded the flight as one of the last passengers and traveling as a family we got a bad vibe from a particular staff on the flight, that same staff and another staff due to the staff them not focusing on the job at hand she accused us of stealing a mug from the airline and she started causing drama saying all sorts of things in French which we could not understand - we asked her to verify but she would not and just went on talking trash.  This is the worst experience I have ever had while traveling and after my return I hope to never fly with Asky again unless an action is taken towards the behavior of their staff.",,,,,
"  Lagos to Accra. This is by far the worst airline I’ve seen in my life. I booked a direct flight from Lagos to Accra round trip and we were delayed for 4 without any feedback, they later told us we can’t fly that day due to technical difficulties so they stuck us in an hotel and promise us that we will fly the next morning by 12 noon. The got to the airport and they delayed us till 2:30pm, we were told later that the flight available is to Lomé (Togo) and we should bear with them. We reluctantly agreed and when we landed in Lomé they fixed us in another flight to Abidjan (cote de ivoire). We flew for about 1hr 5min and waited in the plane for 30 minutes before heading to Accra. We got to Accra by 8pm and mind you a flight from Lagos to Accra is just 1hr 5mins. I strongly advise anyone not to use this airline, they are not transparent and trustworthy.",,,,,
"  Lome to Lagos. Horrible, it was nothing but a nightmare, and detestable experience. I regret ever buying that ticket and felt I just wasted my money and time.  I got to Lagos on Dec 17th with only my hand luggage. I was told my two luggages did not make it to Lagos. They were left at Lome with others because our connecting flight the ASKY airplane is small and cannot carry too much load. They will be flown to Lagos at no particular date. So, I was asked to check with them every day. Meanwhile, I had no clothes, footwear and every item I was to use for my daughter's wedding on December 22nd was in those two suit cases. I checked on the airline for three consecutive days and could not go home with my luggage. I ended up repurchasing clothes for my entire stay and for my daughter's wedding. I was only able to collect my luggages on January 2nd more than two weeks after I arrived Lagos, and the next day boarded the useless plane back to Lome before connecting Ethiopian Airlines back to Newark. Meanwhile, I had excess luggage as a result of all the new clothes I bought for my stay, since the one I brought was left at Lome. I pleaded for mercy so I will not be charged excess luggage fee but all fell on deaf ears. I gave them my debit card to pay for the excess luggage, but was told their POS machine wasn't working and as such I have to pay cash. Meanwhile I had no cash on me, the representative flatly told me there's nothing he can do. Either I pay cash or I will miss the flight. I sought for the manager, he gave me the worst response any traveler would want to hear. He blamed his inefficiency on Ethiopian Airline another connecting flight. They closed their counter, leaving me running around for cash. When eventually I brought the cash, I was told it was too late. I did not receive any apology for my luggages that I got 2 weeks after my arrival which was the reason for my excess luggage. My case was not an isolated one. It was the same for thousands of travelers who used their services last December.  All they do is ruin their customers vacation and make them cry for the airlines mistake. Stay away from them if service, efficiency and respect and dignity matter to you.",,,,,
"Lome to Conakry with ASKY Airlines. Well let's start out on the first part of the trip, showed up to the airport at 4 am to get told my flight is delayed until 9 am. The delay was because Bakmao airport was under construction which when we arrived, nothing was under construction. Having this delayed made me miss my flight from Lome to the USA. Now returning back to Conakry, Arriving in Lome we got off the airlines looking for a representative for the airlines to have to wait in line for an hour (only 8 people) to get told my luggage may or may not be on the flight. So I took it upon myself to go get my luggage and recheck it. After getting to my gate, the flight was delayed an hour an half without any word from the representatives explaining why. Only thing they would say is wait here and sit. After finally boarding it was again delayed another 30 minutes. After arriving in Bamako, I watched my luggage exit the plane, I let the flight workers know and they said they would check on it. After sitting at the airport for 30 minutes they told me it was taken care of. After arriving to Conakry I was told my luggage was left in Bakamo along with 10 other passengers and will receive it in two days. This airline has been nothing but a disappointment and I will never fly the airline again and will not recommend it.",,,,,
Not very good. The flight from Accra to Lome was late. My flight from Lome to Adoula was cancelled. Very poor information from airline management at Lome. No information as to when our flight from Lome to Aduola would be going ahead. In the end we were woken up at 3am in our hotel and told to check out at 4am. Unfortunately the airport at Lome didn't open till 5am so I and everybody else sat around until then. Still when the flight took off we got to Adoula in reasonable time. There seems to be some issues with management control/ passenger information that seriously need addressing.,,,,,
"Travelled on ASKY from Douala-Bangui. I asked to see my bag prior to it being loaded to verify it was actually there. I was able to see my bag however when I arrived in Bangui I found out it was not loaded along with other passengers baggage. I was told this was because the flight was too full and the baggage was offloaded due to weight. Despite numerous phone calls and emails I still not have received my bag. ASKY agents have shown no interest whatsoever I arrived in Bangui with no other clothing. The flight was booked through Ethiopian Airlines as they claim to be ""partners"" Ethiopian said they cannot help once ASKY receive the bag. I would not recommend this airline to anyone they are arrogant and have no customer service at all!",,,,,
Douala to Accra via Lome. No real problems at check in just had to pay a little for excess baggage which was mercifully cheap. The only problem was finding the departure gate which was right at the end of the right arm. It looked closed until you navigated round a few doors. The flight left a little early. The aircraft for this leg into Lome was a new Q400. Basic snack was provided on what was a short flight. Lome was chaos - the airport is just not big enough to act as any sort of hub as it does for ASKY. So I only just made the connecting flight after all the queues. This time a new 737 for the 20 minute hop down to Accra. Again no problems with this leg. Overall a pretty good experience - they just need to sort out Lome. There is some construction work going on nearby so maybe that will be resolved.,,,,,
I travelled Ghana to Freetown on ASKY. There were delays leaving Accra- but in Africa this is usually expected. On my return trip- from Freetown to Accra I arrived at the airport almost 3 hours early to find out - from the security guard - that the flight did not come in the night before so the flight was cancelled. No ASKY agent was there at that time so I waited more people showed up for the flight and they actually called their travel agent who called ASKY and said the flight was cancelled. They just booked on another airline and left. I purchased my ticket through Ethiopian Air and did not have any contact details (there are no phone numbers on the web site or anything). So I waited at the airport for an ASKY rep to tell me what to do and when the next flight would be. I waited until after my flight should have departed. Having no money and the hotels not taking credit cards I could not stay overnight to try the next day. Plus I missed my connection in Accra. So I had to purchase a British air flight to get home. Paying for a new ticket and forfeiting both my return ASKY flight as well as my flight home to Canada from Ghana. Once home I had my colleagues in get me contact info for ASKY. I emailed them and followed up with a phone call - I was told to contact my travel agent. I called Ethiopia air- and they said they have nothing to do with it. I have emailed ASKY numerous times no response. I highly recommend no one use this airline.,,,,,
A great little airline launched recently in Togo with the backing of Ethiopian Airlines. The return journey from Banjul to Freetown was made as straightforward as possible by Asky who laid on the connecting bus and fast ferry as part of the ticket costs from the strangely located Lungi Airport on one side of the wide river estuary to Freetown on the other. Not all the airlines flying into Freetown do this so full marks to Asky. The flights were really smooth in good aircraft with courteous and helpful cabin crew. A very welcome discovery and an airline that I'm busily recommending now to friends and colleagues in Banjul & Freetown.,,,,,
"  Istanbul to Tehran. They lost our suitcase with all our belongings. For follow up they refered us to another interim section. Their excuse was: ""It happens everywhere even with famous airlines"". It was really waste of time and money and a bad experience for us. I will never use this airline again.",,,,,
"  Tehran to Tabriz, and ATA Airlines used an MD-82. The aircraft have seen its better days long time ago. Flight from Tehran to Tabriz was re scheduled one hour later as originally but I got information upfront. Finally there have been another 45 minutes delay as there seemed to be a technical problem. During waiting it becomes very warm as the aircon was not working till departure. The return flight was in time. Seating is very tight especially when aircraft was almost full which was the case on both flights. Crew was friendly but English skills are limited. On both one hour flights they serve a lunch box, banana, juice, chocolate bars. However, when flying in Iran, ATA Airlines is one of the better airlines, there are no better alternatives on this route. Either you use them or take the bus or the train. ",,,,,
" Copenhagen to Sorvagur return. Wonderful experience, many smiles by service team, multiple drink refills, decent in-flight entertainment via own device and very smooth flight into Faroer. An excellent value for money and perhaps one of the last remaining airlines in Europe that treats customers as many did in the past. I got the impression that the team liked their job and were happy to welcome everyone on board. We pre-ordered delicious snacks and very comfortable seats. Flights were on time and a breeze, a perfect start into the vacation and back home.",,,,,
" Copenhagen to Vagar in the Faroe Islands with Atlantic Airways (RC453). A319 aircraft. Friendly check-in, received baggage tag and headed to the gate. Flight boarded in an organized fashion and flight attendants greeted each passenger as you entered the cabin. Nice colors and comfortable seats. Lots of legroom actually - was very surprised. On-time take off and 2 hours to the Faroe islands - soda, water and coffee serviced complimentary but purchased wine and food was reasonably priced. Inflight entertainment was just the flight-map but had my DVD's to watch. Landed a few minutes late in crazy wind and rain, but the landing was good. Parked farthest possible on the tarmac from the entrance to the terminal so we all got wet, but that is how it is there. Bags off in a reasonable amount of time. Oveall a very good flight and for the price a good deal.",,,,,
"I had two flights with Atlantic Airways. Flight Bergen- Faroe Islands and Faroe Islands to Copenhagen one week later. Both flights on time. Comfortable seats, clean aircraft, good food, friendly service. I will flight with Atlantic Airways again with pleasure.",,,,,
"Copenhagen to Vagar (Faroe Islands), and the Atlantic Airways A319 was still quite new and had the feature of mood lighting (which you don't see on many European short haul aircraft). The cabin layout was very nice. The food was simple, but good : a nice little wrap, salad with fresh salmon, bread and little mini-Rittersport chocolate. Very surprised that only 45 minutes after the meals / drinks service they did a second drink service (a full aircraft on a 2.05hr flight!). The service was friendly and the lady who served me was most charming. A simple short haul flight, but very pleasant!",,,,,
"The short journey was very pleasant, the staff were very friendly and the food on-board was excellent. I would recommend them to anyone flying to the Faroe Islands.",,,,,
I have flown Atlantic Airways numerous times between the Faroe Islands and Copenhagen. The flight attendants are some of the best around and they consistently go out of their way to ensure that passengers have a good experience. The new Airbus is more comfortable than the older planes. The airlines offers free alcohol and above average coffee. Food however is below average.,,,,,
Small company but very friendly and efficient staff. All passengers treated as business class travelers even though Atlantic Airways only offers one class (economy). Small planes (Bea 146 and Airbus 319) but the comfort is all right for the short trips between Scandinavian countries Faroe Islands and Britain.,,,,,
CPH-FAE return new aircraft on time friendly and smiling FA snack alcoholic/ non-alcoholic beverage served.,,,,,
Flew to Vagar Faroe Islands. Smooth flight lasting 2 hrs 15 mins each way. Flight attendants were friendly and efficient. Seats comfortable and spacious adequate storage space for inflight luggage. Free snacks served as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.,,,,,
Flew on Atlantic Airways from Copenhagen to Vagar and return on economy on a BAe 146. A safe and smooth flight considering the north atlantic winds! Crew friendly and efficient and nice leather seats with an acceptable leg space. Would definately recommend this airline and would fly them again.,,,,,
  There are two options for getting from Dar es Salaam to Zanzibar – a two-hour ferry journey or a 20 minute flight. The main airlines flying this route are Auric Air and Air Tanzania. Ordering the ticket via Opodo was easy and the airline operates from Terminal 1 – a small building about 1km from the main terminals. Check-in was efficient and the waiting room had several powerful air conditioning units. You could even buy food and drink. Tickets were checked and we were walked across to the Cessna. It had three seats in each row and although tight it was not uncomfortable. It only had a pilot and we flew at about 3000 feet giving us a clear view of the sea and then the island. It ended with a very smooth landing close to the terminal.,,,,,
  I haven’t boarded just yet. Flight was cancelled by the airline. Been really looking forward to the flight as I’m visiting my family that I don’t get to see that often. What’s shocking is that in order to change the ticket I need to pay even though airline is the one who cancelled the flight and customer service is not available. On the phone queue for 3 hours already and no answer. I’m lost for words. Is there anyone at all who is willing to help or we just cash in these days! Disappointed is just understatement!,,,,,
"  Gatwick to Guernsey on an ATR 72. This is a small plane, very small. So small in fact I banged my head upon entering the cabin. I'm 6ft tall and couldn't stand upright, seating was okish, the seat was comfortable enough but legroom was very restricted. Cabin crew were friendly enough and the flight was fairly short, around 45 minutes. Guernsey to Gatwick on an Embraer 195. This is a bigger aircraft, legroom was a little better but the seat was considerably more uncomfortable. Cabin crew were a little surly and again the flight was short, 30 mins, and uneventful. Aurigny, I believe, are the only airline that flies to Guernsey from the UK, so having a monopoly they aren't too concerned with customer service. BA, to my surprise, gave complimentary hot drinks and a breakfast bar on their Belfast city - Heathrow route. Aurigny charge £2.50 for a small cup of basic tea/coffee and if you want a breakfast bar or muffin with that the price rises to £3.50. Now consider that my BA ticket cost less than Aurigny. If another airline starts flying to Guernsey then they might start giving out complimentary hot drinks, until then they will continue to gouge the customer.",,,,,
"  Flown this route return 4 or 5 times. Of course, a visitor to Guernsey has no choice, the airline has a monopoly. The flights themselves were only an hour, and uneventful. Aurigny flight team is usually OK. Not rude, but not terribly friendly, either. My last trip, the Guernsey airport staff was a very bad dream. They treated me like a suspected terrorist (I'm a past-middle-aged solo female traveler.) Kept me until the plane was completely boarded. I was the last one allowed on board. They opened my suitcase and removed every single item. They turned my book upside down and flipped the page, looking for who knows what. I fully expected sniffer dogs at some point. Since the trip itself had been stressful (horrendous weather, hotel room robbed), this last insult was so upsetting! I was finally allowed on the plane, but fighting tears. The flight attendant was nasty and gave me a ""look"" for holding everyone up.",,,,,
"  Gatwick to Guernsey booked for late April. I am a US citizen who planned to vacation in the UK. With the Coronavirus, we had to cancel our plans. Every business that we preplanned and prepaid with has refunded every dollar even-though all our tours were labeled “non refundable“. Delta also refunded every cent! Aurigny, is the only exception. They told me use my travel insurance because they are not giving me a refund. Can you believe at this time, with this world pandemic emergency situation that this airline refuses a refund. Its not like I merely just changed my mind. Im not allowed to get to UK to take this flight from this airline.",,,,,
" Aurigny has a monopoly on flights in Guernsey so you have no other option that to book with them. The staff on board the flight look miserable, like they do not enjoy working there at all. The checkin staff at Gatwick were ok but the checkin at Guernsey was bad, such grumpy staff. We were 2kg over on checkin which was quoted as going to cost 20pounds! We only had 3 carry-on bags (out of our limit of 4) and the plane wasn't full, so common sense would say just let it through. Instead we had to take the 2kg out and make a 4th carry-on bag. So the weight is still in our entitlement but what a pain! Then on arrival to Gatwick our brand new expensive Samsonsite suitcase had a huge gash on the front of it! I was shocked. There was no person at the baggage info desk at Gatwick (South Terminal). So when I got home and had a customer feedback email from Aurigny, I answered it straight away and told them about the problem. I got no response. I emailed Aurigny again after I returned home from my holiday only to be told: ""The online Survey that is sent out does not come from Customer Services. All claims have to come to this email address, and we have checked, and we definitely didn’t have any emails from you until yesterday. I’m afraid on this occasion we would have to recommend claiming through your travel insurance."" To say that I am disappointed in this service is an understatement. I sincerely hope I have never have to fly on Aurigny ever again, nor would I ever recommend the airline! take the ferry from the mainland or fly to Jersey with another airline and then transfer to Jersey via ferry!",,,,,
  The flight was scheduled from Leeds Bradford to Guernsey at 14.15 on Monday 13 February and was cancelled once we had checked in baggage. No reason was given but we were bused to Manchester where we boarded an alternative flight at 1915. It was notable that there were no adverse weather conditions and regular travellers on the flight indicate that cancelling the Leeds flight is a regular occurrence in order to fill the Manchester flight - this seems a method of marketing the Manchester flight! Surprise surprise the Leeds Flight was also cancelled on Monday 20 February!,,,,,
"We flew from Gatwick to Guernsey and no problem with hold baggage or cabin baggage. However, on our return, at Guernsey check in, our cabin baggage didn't fit in their tester 'box' (despite being bought as hand baggage size), so we had to take out the laptop, iPad and sat nav and put into a carrier bag. Other people were checking in with much larger rucksacks and hold-all whose owners weren't even asked to test if theirs fitted the tester box! If our bag was too large, then fair enough, the measurements were on the Aurigny website but where's the consistency and why wasn't it picked up in Gatwick? Not happy when all we can see in departures are massive 'hand baggage'!",,,,,
" Norwich to Guernsey with Aurigny Air. Online service very good, when I was booking my seats 2 months after booking the flights I noticed I had spelt my wife's name incorrectly, but 1 email to aurigny put that right with no extra charge. The flight to Guernsey from Norwich was on time and landed early, the same when coming back. The flight had 36 people coming back so about 80% full, complementary drinks are served which made a nice change. The flight crew kept us informed through out the flight. I would recommend this airline.",,,,,
"  We had booked our flights and prepaid for selected seats in February 2016. We chose to sit on row 19a and c on both flights. Flew out from Manchester to Guernsey on 2nd August 2016, flight had slight delay but nothing too bad. Service onboard was rushed, drinks and duty free served very early into the flight, then cabin crew sat and chatted for the rest of the flight. The return flight was a shambles. Upon arriving at Guernsey airport we were asked if we would like to change our seats, I declined this offer. Upon boarding at the gate I was given different seat numbers from those I had chosen and paid for. I explained to the gate staff that I had chosen my seats prior to the flight and wished to sit on those seats, the gate staff looked at me and told me to sort it out with the crew. Upon boarding the aircraft the stewardess was heard to say that the seats we had been allocated were in the same area of the plane, so could not see a problem. I stated that we required our chosen seats, which other passengers were sitting on. She did ask these passengers to move, which they did. If we had accepted the alternative seats, there was infact passengers sitting on these too. Again the drinks were served very early in the flight, but this time there was an announcement stating there was no hot water so only cold drinks could be served. Quickly after this came the duty free. The cabin crew spent the rest of the flight chatting to a passenger who also worked with the airline, talking very loud so that announcements made by the pilot could not be heard. I have flown on many airlines in the past, both scheduled and chartered. I feel that the price charged is very high, considering it is only a 70 minute duration, and the service offered is extremely poor. What is the point of giving passengers the option to pre-book and pay for seats it their request is not provided? I can now understand why Aurigny Air is receiving such bad press recently.

"  Left Guernsey on time 7.30am with clear beautiful skies. Midway through flight there was a loud bang, cutting a long story short, we were all told an engine had blown and were going to make an emergency landing at Stansted on the one remaining engine. The stewardess, who was great, talked us through the crash procedure, hands on head and when told to brace lean forward. All very disturbing and scary. We landed safely but not with twists and turns and were greeted by 5 fire vehicles. We were told to collect our luggage and meet at a Menzies counter and a coach would take us on to Norwich. No one came with us, we waited in front of a monitor to see where our luggage was for 40 minutes, luckily another passenger found ours. We then struggled to find the Menzies counter. A lady briefly appeared telling us they were still trying to get a coach. After 40 mins we were told to go to stop 34, which again a few of us failed to find easily. Boarded our coach and arrived in Norwich 4 hours late without anyone greeting the coach when it arrived. We were not even offered a cup of coffee to calm our nerves, one lady said to me it was like they were blaming us - not the sort of service you'd expect after such a traumatic flight",,,,,
"I booked my flight with Aurigny Air via skyscanner from London to Guernsey, or at least I thought I had until I arrived at check in and was informed that my flight destinations were swapped. When I went to the help desk to change this she told me it would cost £125! (more than my initial flight). After I paid this I wondered how I could be so stupid to book the destinations the wrong way around, to which the lady told me that it happens all the time because Aurigny Air's  website always changes the destinations so the outbound flight is from Guernsey (even if you have been linked to Aurigny Air's website from another website like skyscanner with specific flights already selected.) When I arrived at Guernsey and told some locals they agreed that it happens all the time and they have never heard of Aurigny charging customers to change the flights as it is a fault of their website. As for the actual flight it was pleasant and I enjoyed the complimentary drink (even though the journey is only 35 mins!) and newspaper, the staff were friendly and polite and seats were comfortable. Just be warned when using skyscanner to book your flights through this company as they really need to change the way their website works - this seems to be a common and very expensive problem!",,,,,
"Always fly with Aurigny Air to and from London Gatwick and things always go smoothly. Unfortunately you can't always rely on the weather in Guernsey but Aurigny are very good at helping in these situations, complimentary press and drink onboard for the short flight. Staff on board (cabin crew and officers in the cockpit) very friendly, first officer very friendly telling all the information on flight time, weather, height etc over the tannoy.",,,,,
"Southampton to Alderney. Some positives. We left on time and arrived on time both out and on return. Check in was fine but having checked in on line, this was and is a complete waste of time for this route currently. The plane is very noisy so take ear plugs and space is also at a premium so not much room. The flight is about 45 mins. The cost is diabolically high and for anyone to suggest this is a cheap flight they are clearly on something. We paid over £410 there and back with 2 travelling. I can get to the States cheaper than this. They say there is a customer focus attitude. A week before or flights we were rung up and told our return flight was cancelled and so we had been moved onto a flight 2 hours previous. We asked about compensation and clearly the customer focus attitude was abroad on that day, because we were told that we can cancel if we wish. What are we going to do - walk? We could of course fly with another airline but of course there isn't one, so they can do what they like. I was advised that that they also forced the shutdown of a local boat shuttle service to Guernsey, where you could get a Flybe flight to Gatwick or Stansted.",,,,,
"Been going with Aurigny Air for years now to fly over to Guernsey and they have been a good airline. Did have a delay in 2015, our flight from Gatwick to Guernsey was supposed to fly out at 10:00 and was delayed till 12:30 so we got the minibus to the plane (as my relative is disabled) got to the place and the plane wasn't even there and was still in Guernsey so we came back into the airport and then got called back down at around 3 - we didn't get any vouchers. A 5 hour delay is nothing compared to other reviews about Aurigny however the flight back was peaceful and the new jet makes the journey quicker - even had a chat to the pilot and cabin crew whilst waiting on the plane to get the minibus and they were all very friendly and pleasant",,,,,
"Aurigny Customer Service staff must be the worst in the world, the recent fog caused some delays at U.K airports, whilst still on the island having a meal before my flight at a local restaurant I heard that there was flight delays so I telephone Aurigny to find out how long etc, I was told no all is well get here on time. Turned up for my 5.15pm flight at just before 4pm and was immediately told story five hour flight delay nothing we can do, went to customer services - who were useless. Whilst I was speaking to a man there, a lady in the back ground put a leaflet on the counter in front of me and said ""its all in there"" and went back to her seat and sat down, the leaflet was about delays, great customer service. We went upstairs and ordered some snacks and drinks and just as I paid, tannoy announced that our flight was now leaving ASAP and was going to Liverpool, not Manchester and that a coach would be there waiting to take us to Manchester. We left everything, checked in and then sat for over an hour in departures. Finally arriving at Liverpool guess what no coach and no one aware of this arrangement, eventually a Liverpool airport member of staff said she was arranging a coach for us, some people asked if a taxi would be paid for by Aurigny and they were told no, now near 10pm and most of the passengers now left making their own way to Manchester the member of staff returned and said she may have a coach for us, and then said where is everyone. Well they have all gone was the reply and we are off too, thanks for the help. Aurigny`s objective was just to get shut, thanks to them I had to make my own way to Manchester at 11pm collect my car and then drive back through the thick fog getting home at near 1am, it would have been safer for all just to get the next safe flight out. When I telephone Aurigny for a refund for the taxi I was told no chance, not our fault and once off the island not our problem and that they are not part of the EU rules. When I tried to put my point I was then told by the young girl on the phone that she was now terminating the call. After a couple of calls I have now been told that I am getting my Taxi fare back but thats it, no compensation for the delay at Liverpool as we were off the island and not their problem.  Customer services at the airport and on the phone score nil, urgent training required nothing complex just the art of communication would be a good start, how to talk to people.",,,,,
"We flew Ryanair to Stansted to connect with this flight. Ryanair late and baggage took 30 minutes to get to carousel which meant we were late for bag drop (minimum one hour for domestic flight). Rang Aurigny to see if we could get our bags processed 50 minutes before departure time. No go and no assistance. I was in the middle of booking flights for the next day when a staff member Menzies Aviation came out, and asked if he could assist us. When we explained the situation he told us the flight had been delayed and he would see if he could get our bags on. 2 minutes later all sorted no thanks to Aurigny. Our flight left 40 minutes late anyway and as we have now found out their flights had been delayed by fog. So why didn't the ""customer service"" person at Aurigny know that and also offer to see if we could join that flight? Maybe it was because she had no customer skills and spoke to me as if I was trying to put something over her. ",,,,,
"We had a weekend trip to Guernsey from Gatwick. Both flights were late. On the return flight, seated at the back of the aircraft I was subject to the flight attendants' conversation grumbling about their job and their employer. I feel a little put off from making future leisure trips to Guernsey, as this airline is quite expensive, suffers delays, and does not provide the warmest service.",,,,,
"A great no frills, low cost airline. I highly recommend for little inter-island hops around the Channel Islands. However I am prompted to write a review today due to really appalling customer service via telephone this week. A tetchy member of staff, a very poor line (or as I suspect chin to mouth piece) a stroppy, irritated response when I could not hear well, a curt reply to my inquiry and the phone going dead before I could scarcely say thank you and good bye. Courtesy costs nothing. I await my next flight in trepidation and am giving a high score for previous trips and polite, well mannered staff.",,,,,
"Flew from LCY to GCI return. Outbound: Quick and easy check in at LCY, straight through security then to departures. LCY can get quite busy in the mornings but managed to find a seat without any problems. Bused to the aircraft. Onboard great friendly service, complimentary drink and duty free items offered. Flight time approx. 1 hour. Return: Check in at GCI can be a bit slow espicially if there are a couple of other flights departing around the same time. Same friendly service on board for the return trip. The aircraft used is the smaller version of the ATRs they have in their fleet but offers the same cabin layout as the bigger ATR aircraft, the seat pitch is exactly the same. This is Aurigny's newest route and is a great alternative to Gatwick and would highly recommend this for anyone starting or finishing their journey in central London. If you book in advance the fares are reasonable and once you factor the train cost to Gatwick the fare is not much different. LCY is a great airport to travel through, quick, easy and hassle free compared to the bigger London airports.",,,,,
We flew to Gatwick from Guernsey on 24th April excellent and early flight and great crew but we waited an hour and 10 minutes from leaving the plane to retrieving our luggage. No one to ask in the CI luggage reclaim area you couldn't go back nor leave the area. Unacceptable I am afraid. We would have understood had their been a security alert or another problem but nobody communicated with us. Luckily we did not miss any on going connections but come on how difficult is it to unload a plane and get bags through in a quick manner?,,,,,
Flew from MAN to GCI and then from GCI to BRS over Easter weekend. Not bad value considering they pretty much the only way of getting to Guernsey. Free bag soft drink and newspaper but you would want to be incredibly short to have any hope of being comfortable in these seats for any amount of time. The crew on board we very professional and pleasant to deal with and seemed to enjoy what they were doing. Flight from GCI to BRS was operated by VLM on a Fokker 50 that was as old as the hills still it had a lot more legroom than the ATR on the previous flight. Nice service by nice crew on a short flight.,,,,,
Flew the first time with Aurigny from LGW to GCI and return. All flights were on time aircraft still looks very new comfortable seats with enough leg space flight attendants doing their best to offer free drinks and the Guernsey Press within the short flight time and 20 kg luggage was included in ticket price. Overall it was a surprising good value for money and I felt well-cared all the time will definitely recommended this airline.,,,,,
I fly Gatwick-Guernsey-Alderney or Southampton-Alderney return about eight times a year. The service is excellent value for money (considering the costs of operating old small planes) always a friendly smile at Southampton and in Alderney. More a community bus service than an airline except the new Embraer 195 used on Gatwick-Guernsey is very sleek and professional. You spend longer waiting for bags at Gatwick sometimes than actually in the air - so tend to stick to Southampton (plane to train personal best so far at 3 minutes 40 seconds). Fantastic.,,,,,
I flew GCI-LGW-GCI in November. 5 minutes early on departure. Arrival into LGW early. Even the bags arrived quickly. Cabin crew under pressure to serve the free drinks but got there. On return the only slight delay was the need for the long taxi down to the end of the runway at Gatwick. On time arrival. On E195 super plane 31m flight. Bag delivery in GCI could be improved though very slow. I have travelled 30+ times on Aurigny this year. Never let me down they always get me home.,,,,,
I flew from Jersey to Alderney via Guernsey and experienced delays. Not really a problem as had been warned by telephone of the delay in Guernsey and the fact that it happened in Jersey was immaterial. Everyone was perfectly friendly and civilised. However a few days later I flew from Alderney to Gatwick via Guernsey and while the flight was fine and everything on time I found the ground and cabin staff to be offhand at the very least and was made to feel as if I was an idiot when I undid my seatbelt to pay for my drink and when I asked for information on arrival in Guernsey. I really think that as a small airline if they want to attract customers they should give their staff better training in their general approach. Just a smile and a pleasant way of speaking would be an improvement on a sigh and a grimace.,,,,,
Flew on the new jet from Gatwick to Guernsey and back last Thursday - a trip I often make. New Embraer 195 aircraft is now being used by Aurigny. Flights both ways on time and very quick coming back in the evening from take off to landing was just 31 minutes. That meant a difficult job for the cabin crew to get drinks to everybody in time but they're obviously used to it and completed the task with a few minutes to spare. As always with Aurigny a great and friendly service only quicker now!,,,,,
East Midlands to Guernsey on an ATR-72. Nice to have a proper airline service with a person to check in your bag plus complimentary drinks and newspaper on board. Aircraft clean and presentable departed on time but arrived slightly late due to strong head winds. Flight a little bumpy in parts. Cabin crew service efficient and with a smile. Good flight price. Would fly with Aurigny from my local airport again.,,,,,
My wife and I had gone to Guernsey for a weekend so we could do the G-JOEY flight having seen voted best small airline by which magazine makes them look good. The weather was a bit poor and they do say if there is bad weather the flights might get cancelled so as is was awful we were not to sure if the flight would go ahead. Twenty minutes from departure the clouds broke up and sun started to appear which was a relief but then the flight got cancelled we were taken out of departures and that was it. We were told that according to the metro logical forecast the weather was not good but had Aurigny ops looked out of there window it was sunny and as we were only having a twenty minute trip on the plane And I saw no problem weather wise. However the truth came out accidentally let slip by a member of staff that the plane was needed for the 15.20 Alderney service to depart late at 15.55 which is why the trip was cancelled where as our schedule should have been a 15.45 departure. We were not the only passengers that had travelled from mainland Uk just for this flight and felt let down by the airline after paying to fly to Guernsey for the short flight. Having contacted the airline and no reply yet why they need twenty eight days to reply I will never know for a small airline sadly now I will possibly not get to fly this aircraft as it is due to come out of service.,,,,,
Me and my wife use Aurigny often as our daughter grandchildren and son in law live on Alderney. The staff are friendly and polite. Only get delayed when there is bad weather on the island. Only criticism is the price of tickets could do with more offers as we fly from Southampton.,,,,,
We have just used Aurigny Air for the first time flying from East Midland to Guernsey. We have flown over the last 6 yrs several times a year with Flybe - no more. flight was on time going and coming back in fact we made it both ways ahead of time both ways staff were smart polite and professional. What was also nice was the complementary drink and free local paper.,,,,,
30/8/2013 from Stansted on flight no GR437 to Alderney via Jersey and Guernsey and returned on 3/9/2013. Impressed with the friendliness and helpfulness of staff second to none. The only blip on the horizon was at the information desk in Guernsey where expecting the usual smile in answering a simple question was completely the opposite small moan in what was first class treatment. We shall certainly travel with your airline again and tell our friends to do the same.,,,,,
Flight cancelled out of Guernsey due to fog - put on a flight 28 hours later (which was 30 mins late taking off). Staff totally disinterested - no offer of practical or financial help - just told to claim on travel insurance. To cap it all we were placed right in the middle of a noisy football team when we finally got away.,,,,,
The user requested that this review be withdrawn due to pressure being exerted on them by the airline.,,,,,
I am a devoted traveller (LGW and back every week for many weeks in the year and I always travel Aurigny if I can) and I always book my family on Aurigny. However my families experience with delayed or cancelled flights in the last 6 months and the experience of friends is beginning to make me seriously doubt my loyalty. Their chairman mentioned a few months ago that the reliability was going to improve and it hasn't. Reliability is crucial to an airline. Aurigny is vital to Guernsey.,,,,,
Jersey to Guernsey 08.03.13 as always you cannot fault any part of the trip. A fun start to the day to prepare oneself for the evening return with the blue spotted one to Southampton - maybe. Anybody visiting the Channel Islands for a short break should take a trip on a Trislander.,,,,,
Travelling Manchester to Guernsey GY671 on 19 December 2012. The 17.10 flight was delayed until the next day due to bad weather. Aurigny kept us informed arranged coach transport from and to airport to Crowne Plaza Hotel with very good Evening meal and Breakfast. Next morning offered a drinks voucher at the Airport as we could not take off until 11.45.,,,,,
Flew to Alderney from Southampton. A very pleasant short flight friendly captain. Aircraft is too small for safety demonstrations so you have to watch a short film in the departure lounge. My partner left his passport and mobile onboard and they phoned us a few hours later to inform us they would be ready for collection on our return flight. As the aircraft is very small it is not at all comfortable but a good inflight magazine. Cost of the flights was high considering the short journey time.,,,,,
Like all budget airlines Aurigny charge over the odds for credit card booking. £3 per person to encourage you to reserve a seat is a joke - they automatically allocate seats not next to each other upon web check-in - meaning I was at the back of the plane and my partner at the front. Plane's are very old. Leg room OK but wherever you are in the country (we were flying from East Midlands) it's never usually much more then an hours flight. Overall the flight is a means to an end.,,,,,
SOU-ACI-GCI-JER return. Every leg of this journey (entirely on Trislanders) was a pleasure. No delays from Southampton and pilot was friendly. The same pilot flew us on to Guernsey where after a short stop we changed aircraft for Jersey.,,,,,
GCI-MAN-GCI. No queues at check-in desks. Flight on time. Free drinks on board. Helpful crew. Bussing at Manchester due to customs requirements. Baggage handling at Manchester very slow. On return no check-in queue plane pushed back 5mins early. Good value for money free baggage too.,,,,,
EMA-GCI return. Both legs on time. Friendly ground staff and onboard ATR 72 aircraft. Excellent updates from the flight deck and cabin crew offered free drinks & newspaper which is unusual these days. Free hold baggage included in ticket price which is good value. This airline puts many of its bigger rivals to shame.,,,,,
Check-in at Manchester was awful we waited 20mins to check-in. The check-in agent couldn't change my seat no other staff to help. Flight late departing no announcements and no gate staff to ask with a scrum to board when finally called. Aircraft clean but seating cramped and seat broken and kept reclining - after the cabin crew asked 3 times for me to move it she finally listened that it was broken. Cabin crew were not very friendly and on arrival waited 15mins for baggage - GCI airport is tiny and no other flights in so cant understand the wait. Return flight delayed - and on arrival parked at the terminal and yet had to be bussed around the airport. Overall dated airline.,,,,,
Excellent flights to Guernsey & return. Attentive staff. ATR72 aircraft ideal for route. In flight free drinks welcomed and puts rivals to shame.,,,,,
STN-GCI-STN. Overall package was professional and good value for money. The ATR -72 used felt like a white-knuckle ride for much of the journey - don't know if these aircraft are affected more by the turbulence. Attentive and cheerful FAs on both sectors and good updates from the flight deck. Only reason for not awarding more marks was a 2hr delay on return leg not entirely attributable to Aurigny and well dealt with. This airline really puts some of the larger carriers to shame regarding their standards of customer care.,,,,,
STN to Jersey. Everything on time check-in sluggish at both ends but inflight service important to this airline. Free tea coffee or soft drinks and polite cabin crew though some announcements difficult to understand.,,,,,
Gatwick - Guernsey. Showed up only slightly early for check in. Thought we were in for a shocker with the wait but luckily it was for the check in desk neighbor Viking airlines. Auringy desk (of course) had nobody there. Plane was clean. Service fantastic. Free paper was a nice touch and best airline tea.,,,,,
Jersey to Guernsey the early flight. Everyone who likes to fly should fly this route. The Trislander is a real plane and you get to see it all happening from start to stop. Excellent value and a good experience all round.,,,,,
Gatwick - Guernsey Return. ATR72 clean and tidy. Both legs on time. Seat pitch tight if you are tall but acceptable for 45 minute flights. Complimentary soft drink cabin crew working fast to complete full service in tight time constraints. Overall a good regional carrier but with one irritating gripe. There is a £3 fee to choose your seat in advance this under the current climate is not too bad. However if you book a fully flexible ticket and subsequently change your flight although there is obviously no fee for changing your flight you will be expected to pay the £3 AGAIN if you want to choose a seat on the new flight. If you are on a flexible ticket you should really only have to pay the fee for choosing a seat once.,,,,,
LGW-GCI. Very good flight no add-ons like FlyBe etc. Good price online check in free drink and a new ATR72 great value.,,,,,
Return trip from Guernsey to London Stansted. Check In staff helpful and polite free 20kgs baggage allowance and on time departure. Cabin staff excellent. ATR aircraft (even the 2 new ones) are small and quite loud but okay for a 1 hour flight time. Free drinks and newspaper on board is a lovely touch.,,,,,
Gatwick to Guernsey. Couldnt check in online as we had bags and a child which the system doesn't cater for but no queue at the Gatwick check in and the process completed in a couple of minutes. Flight on time. Free soft drinks and tea/coffee and a copy of the local paper was a nice touch. Brand new ATR72 - spotless! On arrival we waited just 5 minutes for our bags. On the return again no queue at check in on time and comfortable. Excellent value for money.,,,,,
Flew to Guernsey from Gatwick. A great start to the New Year with no security queues at Gatwick (wish it was always like that) and a great flight on Aurigny. You get a choice of free soft drinks on board including tea and coffee but this excludes hot chocolate so I stumped up a £1 and had a hot chocolate and a free orange juice. Smooth flight on board the ATR72 though I thought the aircraft looked a little tired. Chatting to the cabin crew I learned that Aurigny is getting two new ATR72 aircraft in March so that should improve matters. Much the same experience coming home again that evening. All in all a good (short) trip to a wintry Guernsey and great value for money.,,,,,
London Gatwick - Guernsey and return. Smooth check-in in both directions with pre-reserved seats. Smooth flights operating on time. Seats comfortable enough for 1 hr flights. Non-alcoholic drinks provided service efficient. Overheat lockers on the ATR72 are very narrow.,,,,,
LGW-GCI. Used the new online check-in which was simple and saved a lot of time at the airport itself. Walking out to the aircraft wouldn't be fantastic on a rainy day. Flight time was just 40 minutes. The first impression of the ATR72 was that it was quite old and worn and noisy. Loads very low with 7 free rows in front of me and many behind too. Staff weren't unpleasant but I can't say they were particularly great either. Just average. Free drinks and arrival was especially easy. We were outside the terminal at Guernsey within 5 minutes of the engines being shut down.,,,,,
GCI-LGW-GCI. Flights on time both ways. Complimentary tea and coffee and soft drinks which is rather rare these days and no charge for hold baggage. Cabin crew ok but nothing special. Aircraft first generation ATR72 which are rather tatty inside and my seat was covered in crumbs on the return flight rather noisy and a lot of vibration compared to jets and newer turboprops. I believe Aurigny are purchasing 2 new ATR72-500 which should be an improvement they certainly need to update the fleet. Reasonable fares as long as you can book well in advance otherwise the price is extortionate.,,,,,
GCI-MAN on ATR 72. Flight 20 minutes delayed due to late inbound (25 mins) but we were kept informed. Watching ground staff from the departure lounge one could see a very focussed and motivated group working together to reduce the delay. This is how it should be done but maybe it is easier for a small airline.,,,,,
Southampton - Alderney. Pilot just rolls up switches on and off we go for a great real flying experience. Superb flight on Trislander each row of seats has its own door and seats are comfortable enough. Great flight on a clear day flew over Southampton and Isle Of Wight straight down over a sparkling sea to Alderney. No catering or ife as it is too noisy and no aisle so unable to hand out drinks etc. If you want to experience real flying in a propellor aircraft an aircraft built like a brick wotsit and flown by super experienced pilots you must try this short hop.,,,,,
Bristol - Guernsey return. Wonderful Flights comfortable seats 2x2 enough leg room to remain comfortable for the short 55 minute approx. flights. Little delay on Outward journey but nothing to cause concern or interference with the trip. Usual sea fog caused return flight to have a delay of around 1 hour 20 minutes nothing anyone can do about natures elements and Sunday Maintenance of the aircraft has to meet States regulations. Return flight was as comfortable as the Outward journey staff equally friendly. Would not hesitate to recommend Aurigny to other travellers to the beautiful Channel Islands Good to see the airline growing and modernising since the States took it over. Only downside to Air Travel between Islands as in to do day trips to different Islands via plane is the horrendous Taxes and Fuel Surcharges which made any chance of us visiting the other Islands impossible on price which is a shame as other Islands lost out on tourist spending which is important to the economy of the Islands.,,,,,
MAN-GCI-MAN.They use atr 72 on this route certainly more comfortable than the saab 340 used previously. flight only 70 mins catering minimal crew friendly and helpful. ticket pricing is now more realistic for the distance flown than a few years ago. all in all a good means of getting to a wonderful island.,,,,,
Have used flight from Cambridge to Jersey and return for last four years. Using Shorts 360 - excellent flight each way and punctual.,,,,,
Bristol to Guernsey - a 45 minutes flight. Top marks - it could not have been better if we were royalty. Will be using again in a few weeks going back for another wonderful holiday in Guernsey.,,,,,
Flew GCI-LGW 19th April with Aurigny. Very smooth check in at Guernsey followed by a comfortable flight to Gatwick. Ground and flight staff friendly and efficient. Nice 2x2 seats on ATR 72 makes for a more comfortable flight than alternative 146 aircraft and seating.,,,,,
 On the way to Vienna my carry on which always fits in overhead bin was found too heavy and checked in free of charge at the gate. On the way back I got airline's email saying they would check it in free of charge at counter 358. At that counter they forced me to pay 70 euro which I wouldn't have paid if I didn't get that email and went straight to gate. Random security check is an obvious lie as the security person asked questions to which I didn't want to give extensive answers and wasn't particularly nice either.,,,,,
"   I travelled from Amman, Jordan to Washington DC, USA via Vienna. The aircraft from Amman to Vienna has seats that are too narrow, no head rest, no screens and the seat cushion is too thin. The flight was 3.5 hours we got cheese sandwich only. Flight from Vienna to USA was in a bigger aircraft so seats were better but still not enough legroom in economy class. Flight duration was 9.5 hours we got one meal and a snack. During the wait for boarding in Vienna airport, economy class travelers were kicked out of the gate waiting area and we were told to wait for boarding elsewhere and that the waiting area by the gate is designated for first and business class only.",,,,,
" This airline first would not honor our request to refund a ticket for 5 traveler that could not make it, then when we arrived they offered vouchers to volunteers to take a later flight, but would not take ours, then simply took our spare seat away. I had purchased premium seating for my family to sit together with a small child, but they did not have our seats assigned. We boarded last. Then 2 out of our 5 bags did not make it on a short, direct 1.5hr flight. It was impossible to contact the airline, they kept giving us different numbers to call, one of which was Lufthansa. Finally two days later we received an email that our delayed luggage arrived at the destination and I took a ferry boat and taxi to the airport only to find out one bag showed up. We had to repurchase clothing for the family member, then received a note that our lost luggage was sent back to our home airport in U.S. Simply no sense of customer service. Ticketing agent interrogated us inquiring about our travel plans, flipping thru our passports, questioning authenticity. Gate agents were no help, general sense of confusion and chaos. Gate agent ran after us and plucked the spare ticket out of my hand to seat someone else. Very odd experience, resulting in cascading effect of ruined vacation.",,,,,
 Boarding in Venice started with a short delay - flight to Vienna was a short however pleasant experience. A decent snack was served accompanied by Austrian wines. FA's were very friendly. Only minor point was the fact that once again the plane was not at a gate in Vienna - despite the bus transfers were Ok. Flight to Brussels was very good despite the delay. On this flight a hot meal was served with a cake as dessert. The meal was very good - good Austrian wines as well. The purser and her assistant on this flight were exceptional. A more than decent business experience in Europe. For sure my best European flight so far during this year.,,,,,
"  Was flying on a business trip from Luxembourg to Belgrade through Vienna. My connection was really short, just 35 minutes, I managed to make it, but my luggage did not. Upon arrival to Belgrade I received an SMS that my luggage was not boarded and some instructions. Reported all to the lost luggage and left my hotel address. I believe that by the evening my luggage arrived to the Belgrade airport, but due to weekends it was delivered to me only on Monday. Since all my clothes were in the suitcase I had to go shopping. Afterwards filled in a report and in a week received a compensation according to their internal policy.",,,,,
"  The worst ever experience in 40 years of flying, dysfunctional and extremely incompetent, try to email, write to them? All your efforts fall on deaf ears, they are not interested to listen. Flight after flight were cancelled without reasonable explanation, Austrian Airlines ruined our much awaited two weeks holiday to reunite with our family, not recommend them at all. Put in a cheap hotel when the connection flight was cancelled as well due to unexplained reasons.",,,,,
  Heraklion to Vienna on 1st July. After arrival we had to wait 5min in the cabin and watch through the window how 2 Airport Workers threw and kicked around our baggage without reason. I phoned the call center and they told me this is not allowed.  I am furious I was not able to tell it to them face to face and ask them if they would like it if someone threw their stuff around like that. Our baggage has been damaged and we have to fill in a form but this won't solve the issue. Flight was good but this was not okay.,,,,,
"  The cabin of Austrian was quite a shock, as totally outdated: no privacy for most seats, no direct access to corridor for many seats near the windows, and a miserable toilet kit. Food was excellent, wines as well, with a very nationalistic touch, as only Austrian wines. The crew was very nice, very attentive, flight was on time and loading well organised.",,,,,
"  It was a full flight, so they announced that everyone could only take one piece of personal items on board.  They proceeded to board people & a lot of people had 2 carry on items & they weren't stopped. Of course I arrive in Budapest & my bag that they made me check at the gate did not make it. I proceeded to the lost bags and they couldn't have cared less. No information about compensation, just here's a link to track your bags. They advised my bag would come through on the later flight & be delivered to my hotel last night. It hasn't arrived & the tracking system has not been updated. I have tried calling & have been on hold since 4.30am, so nearly an hour. I am moving on from my hotel today & I need my bag. I called Austrian Airline to ask about what to do & the woman was so rude. Literally just fill out a form. I asked her about compensation, again fill out a form. I needed to know what to do as I only had the clothes I was in & nothing else. ",,,,,
"  I was forced to check in my trolley at the gate in Vienna. There was lots of space on the aircraft, i could have put my board trolley under the seat in front of me but they said it’s “too heavy”. Avoid Austrian if you can as well as Vienna airport.",,,,,
" Austrian Airline forced me to check in my luggage saying that the flight was fully booked but there were numerous people with bigger ""hand"" luggage who were not required to do that. The personnel could not provide any justification for why the requirement applied to me and not to other people, besides there was space in the cabin.

"  My family and friends (6 persons) bought on 13/4/2022 tickets to Vienna for Christmas 2022. We received confirmation from Austrian Airlines for Flight Athens - Vienna on 25/12/2022 at 14:55 Flight Vienna - Athens on 31/12/2022 at 22:05 On 23/12/2022 I tried to check-in online for the first flight but I received a reply from the system mentioning that it was not possible to complete the check-in and that I should make it at the airport when I will arrive to board to the flight. I called the Customer Serviceto understand if there is something wrong with the system and I discovered that Austrian Airlines cancelled both our flights without notice to us. I asked for a solution for the situation caused by Austrian Airlines and they informed me that they could:  Book seats in an earlier flight (25/12 at 13:25 instead of 14:55) Book seats in another return flight on 01/01/2023 at 18:25 (instead of 31/12 at 22:05) I accepted and booked these tickets upon receiving an assurance from the Customer Service that they will pay for the additional cost that will arise, due to the change of our departure date. I asked if there is any restriction / prerequisite for the expenses and they replied that they do not have any restriction as long as we do not book a five star Hotel. After our trip, we sent the invoices of the expenses to Austrian Airlines and after a two months dialogue they denied to pay our expenses and furthermore they denied to pay compensation.  Fortunately, we discovered APF (Agency for Passenger Rights) and with their efforts, Austrian Airlines “was convinced” for their mistakes and payed full compensation according to the EU directive but about 65% of our expenses because, as they claim, they have restrictions. At the end we accepted the 65% because after five months of continuous efforts with the airline we could not stand it any longer.",,,,,
"  Very bad experience. I lost business meetings because of the delays and the bad service. They caused me a big lost of money.  It took more then 12 hours and 3 flights to arrive from TLV to Malaga (should take max 5 hours of flight). First flight from Tel Aviv to Vienna they lost the slot of departure, then instead of flying directly to Malaga they sent me in a Lufthansa flight to Frankfort and then another flight from Frankfurt to Malaga. I went out at 2:00 am and arrive to destination at 18:00.",,,,,
"  On the 2nd of June we were flying from Sofia to Vienna on OS798 connecting through to Reykjavik on OS0327 In Sofia our flight was delayed, so l checked with the man at our boarding gate about our connecting flight. The man said “ what are you worrying about, you will have 50 minutes before your connection”. On our flight to Vienna; the flights requiring immediate transfer by the passengers were announced, of which our flight wasn’t one of them. Despite this; we went immediately and directly to our gate without delay, as quickly as we could. On approach to the gate, a man was standing near the entrance to the gate waiting area, who was apparently waiting for us. He instantly went into a rage, yelling loud and aggressively at us, saying “ the plane it waited for you, hurry up and get on the plane”! We ran towards the gate, and l said “this isn’t our fault, we just arrived because our flight was delayed”. He started yelling at us again to get your boarding passes and scan them and get on the plane! This is while he stood behind the counter, doing nothing to assist. He then started yelling again to get on the plane again. By this time l finally started verbally responding to his attack on us. We ran down the ramp to the aircraft totally stressed and angry and upset from the attack on us; and told the head stewardess that l want to make an official complaint on the man at checkin. We then went straight towards our seats, helped by an absolutely lovely flight attendant in order to not hold up the flight any longer. Once seated I explained to the attendant what happened and asked her if she could tell the head flight attendant what happened, and asked her if she could obtain the mans details for a complaint. By this time, l was nearly in tears; and my daughter who has a brain disability was a mess in tears. The young attendant was companionate and professional, gave us the complaint email, and said she would include her our report; and did everything she could to make us feel better. Unfortunately; the head stewardess did not once through the flight even bother to speak to us to obtain more details or see if we were ok. This l feel was totally unprofessional and uncaring.  There was so little time between flights, that we arrived in Iceland without our luggage. The staff in Reykjavik were very helpful and professional resolving the problem. Please thank the young flight attendant and the Reykjavik staff, on my behalf please. ",,,,,
" A year ago I took the same flight and I was very satisfied on all accounts. This year I repeated the flight and, probably, it was the last one with Austrian. My ticket states clearly ""MEAL - standard"", as the last year. What I got was a miserable half dry half wet roll of bread with some yellow cheese that half was melted inside the bag, half a tomato slice and a napkin. I was flying to a connection flight without food. To add insult to injury, at 10:00 sharp, when we landed all the food stands were closed. At least out of consideration for those going on another flight without anything to put in the mouth, Austrian should have done differently.",,,,,
 My husband and I both require assistance. Your staff and the airport staff at all of the airports were extremely helpful and made our experience a good one.,,,,,
" Austrian Airlines which I have flown many times of decades has after been taken over by Lufthansa sunk to a new low. The seats are a much tighter squeeze, the qualify of the food on a transatlantic flight, once among the best, is now mediocre, smaller in quality though with an option of two different main meals - chicken or pasta. The cutlery is not even plastic but rather some sort of cardboard plastic, the knife breaking as soon as I cut into the rather tough chicken - even Lufthansa and Swiss have metal cutlery. Limited drink runs during the flight and only water. Crew itself is polite, friendly and dutiful. Flights both direction full and cramped. Only a muffin served for breakfast NYC-Vienna - no cold cuts/cheese platter as years past, no fruit, no yogurt. I believe Lufthansa has dragged Austrian Airlines down several notches since the takeover. Flights on time, baggage arrived safely both directions. I would recommend them but with lesser expectations.",,,,,
"  Had my luggage damaged by Austrian Airlines 5 months ago - despite immediate report to their arrivals ground staff, several calls to their inaudible call center staff and several unanswered e-mails, they have yet to provide compensation.",,,,,
"  One of the worst airlines I have fly with.  For direct fly from New York to Vienna the width of seats been 39cm. This kind of aircraft could be used for short flights but not for 8-9 hours direct flights. Another think is, if you are seated in the last rows of aircraft you will have to eat only what remains crew will just told you that there is only last option even the other passengers have more options. From my point of view this is very unprofessional if you pay same cost as another passengers and you are just unlucky where you’ve been seated. If you have a chance look for another flight and not use Austrian.",,,,,
"  The Manchester to Vienna segment was really good with two wonderful crew but I wish to review here the long haul segment from. Vienna to Bangkok. My seat 7A was rather compact in the lie flat position but for the sitting position it was fine. The cabin crew service on this segment which was led by the purser Karin addressed me at all times by my name, she was very friendly and professional at all times for which I would like to express my thanks and the other six crew were also extremely friendly. The food was also very tasty and plentiful as was the special signature coffee. This was my first experience of traveling with Austrian Airlines and I can highly recommend them, incidently transitting through Vienna airport was very easy and the business class lounge was good.",,,,,
"  I booked a flight with Austrian Airways from Cairo to Stockholm with a connection in Vienna on July 23, 2022. Even though I packed in only a carry on bag and had used the same bag as a carry on other flights during this trip with other Star Alliance airlines, Austrian forced me to check my bag. I explained I had a tight connection and if they checked my bag, it would not make it to my next flight. They didn't care and moved forward with checking my bag. Once I landed in Stockholm, I received an email that my bag had not made my connection. I continually updated their tracking information with my location as they would take days to locate my bag in Vienna. They sent my bag to Stockholm once I had already left for Denmark. Then they sent my bag to Copenhagen with only 2 days left of my trip. However they didn't location my bag in Copenhagen before I had to fly home at the end of my 10 days in Scandinavia. It took an additional 11 days for them to deliever my bag to my home address. I was told I would be reimbursed for essentials like clothes, toiletries, phone charger etc. I saved all my receipts and supplied them to the airline August 4th when I was home. I followed up over 20 times without any resolution. I finally got a response on January 30th, 2023 that they would only reimburse my $260 even though I spent more than that. They said I would receive my $260 via direct deposit within 6 weeks. It has now by 14 weeks since then. I have followed up at least 3 times since January 30th with no response.",,,,,
"  Multiple failures and incompetence, system dysfunctional, bad customer service. We purchased preferred seats for $35/each for me and wife for both round trips Tampa to Bucharest The Austrian online booking did not recorded them but my Credit card was charged 3 times =$270. We called customer service and they promised it will fix that but they never did. Out Flight from Viena to Bucharest on apr 17 (OS 94) forced us to check in the carry on luggage even was permitted as size and weight-other passengers were let have their luggage in the plane. I ordered  Gluten free meals, got a confirmation emails but that was only provided on the going trip and not on the return from Frankfurt to Tampa. Sseat purchased and charged to my cc for return were not ""recorded"" by Lufthansa even I had printed confirmations from Austrian. Lufthansa desk service from Frankford told us the Austrian had Problems.",,,,,
" Overall a good experience. Flight on time, good customer service online and at the airport (Tel Aviv). Very nice and welcoming crew on board. Clean and nice looking cabin.",,,,,
"  This is the second time in a row we travel Business with Austrian and we receive no baggage at arrival. Both me and my wife are Star Alliance Gold members and we choose to fly business. We filed a complaint in January about our delayed luggage . We were attending a wedding in Athens and we had to buy clothes, underwear, shoes personal items from the beginning. Austrian airline is really good to communicate about long waiting list and not solve the problem. No compensation yet. We traveled again yesterday from Larnaca to Stockholm via Vienna. Once again no baggage upon arrival. I am travelling for a course today and i am once again without clothes. Austrian Airlines are constantly humiliating your Gold and Business passengers. We filed a complaint in Star Alliance today. Who is going to pay for their fault in January? Who is going to pay for all the panic the new clothes etc we were forced to buy then? Who is going to pay for all the food (whole 23+ Kg) we carried yesterday which is going to trash when we eventually receive our baggage this time? Who is compensating me when they force me to attend a medical course with training clothes because they chose to depart the airplane before all baggages are loaded in the aircraft ? Who is compensating us for their mistakes and the frustration and anger they caused? ",,,,,
"  Be careful when flying late Fridays the plane might be overbooked. When they ask you to come forward if you want to check hand luggage in, even at no expense from. Get it done else they will lose your hand-luggage. Which just creates big headaches. The will not assist you in any way once it is lost.",,,,,
"  Great flight Vienna to New York.  Good food and bar service; IFE with 100+ movies; friendly crew; and both flights were on time. Considering that Austrian's owned by Lufthansa, which has become one of Europe's worst airlines, I was happily surprised by the service provided by Austrian.",,,,,
" Unfriendly personnel on the boarding gate, my bag was randomly selected to take to luggage while it was the supposed regulations: of course nothing to prove it or fit it into, and was just taken out by flight assistant who threatened to not let you board the first chance she got when trying to argue.

"  The worst customer service. My luggage was lost on August 12, 2022 traveling from Larnaca, Cyprus to Newark, New Jersey, USA. It has been 8 (eight) months that I am dealing with both Lufthansa and Austrian. I have made 30 phone calls to Customer service for the US handled by agencies in the Philippines, South Africa etc. The people are very nice but they can only send reminders to headquarters which they have done several times. I have sent several emails to Customer Relations, they do not accept phone calls. Customer Relations only sends automated responses that mainly say ""be patient"". I only received some information by the US customer service, what agents could see in the system. The information was ridiculous. First, your baggage is in Vienna, come and get it. Then it arrived in Newark but it was not delivered. Then it was in Munchen. Three months ago I asked for a compensation of $300. Never got an answer other than the automated standard response of ""We have a very heavy load of lost luggage, please be patient"". ",,,,,
"  Super bad experience + customer service. Flight was overbooked, they only let us know in the very last minute - literally at supposed departure time. Offered only 120 EUR compensation for the failure to service as booked and 2 hour delay until the next flight. Male flight attendant was unfriendly and denied giving the feedback further that the experience was bad. Female flight attendant was trying to resolve the issue and remained polite. Compensation was only offered in form of prepaid credit card - so not only did they not offer an option for flexible compensation, they also used unnecessary plastic.",,,,,
"  I bought a ticket from Austrian from Frankfurt to Athens via Vienna, one day before my flight and after the online check in one part of my flight the Vienna - Athens cancelled due to a strike. I called the customer service to rebook me for the next day of course I didn't expect for the same day as it was a strike and I even told them I can fly Saturday too as I understand they might be full. The solution that the lady gave to me is full refund. I explained her I need to go back and I must rebook and the next solution was a flight via Munich for Sunday, 3 days after. Plus with my expenses to go from Frankfurt to Munich. I told her this is no solution but a bad joke and I must think what alternative can I have. Then I searched my self and I discovered seats available from Frankfurt to Athens with Lufthansa for the next days of the cancellation so I call them back and asked she don't rebook me to one of those flights? And she did after my request. I will never fly with them again.",,,,,
"  My flight from Sarajevo to Vienna in December 2022 got canceled last minute. No Austrian Airlines employee on sight.  Luckily I had a look at my mails where I saw that I was re-booked on another flight 16 hours later. The canceled flight made me miss work and important meetings. I sent a claim on the Austrian Airlines websites to which they took 3 months to answer. Before they answered I tried to call several times, several numbers, and the answer was always same ""we don't handle claims, you need to wait, claims are answered by mail"". After 3 months they finally answered to tell me that I have no rights to any compensation because ""force majeur: weather was bad"".",,,,,

"  A basic but fundamental complaint. After purchasing two United Airline code-share tickets on Austrian Airlines, I learn that I now have to pay Austrian an additional $35 each for seat assignments, unless I want to see what's left 47 hrs before departure.

"  Booked Hamburg to Phuket via Vienna and Bangkok on one OS ticket. All legs were in C, HAM VIE operated by Eurowings and BKK HKT by Thai Smiles. Was travelling with my partner. We are both status members with LH. In Hamburg and otherwise than stated on their website, Eurowings refused to check luggage through to HKT; reason given “we are not Star Alliance and as such we do not” This meant we would have to get luggage in BKK and check it in for the BKK HKT leg. This is more than annoying, not seamless at all and in addition, the check-in desk lady was more than rude. Unacceptable for a business class experience. Flight on Eurowings was a little late with some nice red wine topped up twice by a very friendly purser. LH lounge in HAM the typical LH standard with some good food and beverage selection. Did not make it to the Austrian lounge, unfortunately. The Austrian flight in VIE left an hour late, due to snow and de-icing. Cabin crew was very nice and charming, absolutely personal and present. Food and wine above LH standards; had booked two ""throne seats"" which were amazing. IFE sub-standard. C cabin was fully booked. Arrived in BKK half an hour late. When arrived in BKK we were told by ground staff that out luggage was NOT on the plane and that we should directly go to the Thai smiles gate; also got an e-mail saying that Thai Smiles was “re-scheduled” to over an hour later than the initial booking. We left almost two hours later than planned – already then knew, things would be bad. Thai Smile offered water, juice and noodles options in the premium cabin. Far away from premium. When we arrived in HKT it was far too late to catch the latest ferry to Kho Yao Yai (that we had already paid); it took as more than two hours to verify our luggage would not arrive and sort things out with the Thai baggage service counter in HKT. Had to book a hotel room, buy clothes and a new transfer to the island. It took Austrian four days to ship our luggage to BKK (although there are several daily flights within Lufthansa group) and another 24 hours to ship from BKK to Kho Yao Yai. In the meanwhile, no information was given by Austrian, no reaction to calls, mails etc. The only information we got was from Thai Smiles “we not not know, we have to wait”. I expect an airline like Austrian to be more supportive, responsive and reactive. What I really hate is, that within Lufthansa group, one family member (i.e. Eurowings) behaves like the unloved child and lets customers exactly feel this. That’s bad behaviour. No need to pay premium prices if you do not get premium service. Things went as bad flying home.",,,,,
"  After reading many reviews, I was sceptical to be flying Austrian Airlines and concerned my luggage wasn't going to make it. We flew BKK-VIE-LHR in Business Class and both flights were excellent. Check in at BKK was very smooth and we were advised of a 1 hour delay to the flight which was a little concerning as we had a 45 minute connection, we were asked to continue with the flight and if the connection is missed then Austrian will sort out a new flight and hotel upon arrival in VIE. We used the Singapore Airlines Lounge at BKK airport which was outstanding, excellent service, food & drink selection. We were priority boarded on the 777 and met by very friendly and smiling crew, there was a pre take-off drink offered which included champagne, orange juice or water. The seats were full flat beds, slightly older style but still very comfortable for the 11 hour flight, there were 2 full meal services on the BKK-VIE leg as well as a snack service mid-flight. Food and drink selection were excellent. Crew were very friendly throughout the flight, i asked about the connecting flight and they were able to confirm near arrival that the onward flight was slightly delayed, they told us the gate number to head to as well. Upon arrival at Vienna Airport, we were able to get between the 2 flights in less than 10 minutes and we made the flight to LHR. The A320 was brand new and had USB charging sockets onboard, we were served a Christmas Dinner in Business Class along with a drinks service, the crew again were very good, efficient and friendly. The business class seat is the same as most European carriers with the middle seat free and a little bit more legroom. Upon arrival at LHR, we were pleased to see that all of our bags had made the connection and waiting for us on the carousel. Overall, I was very impressed with Austrian Airlines and will definitely look at using them again for future flights.",,,,,
" Austrian is regular low cost airline. On time performance, friendly crew and relatively new aircraft. Reminded me lot of Laudamotion which is another Austrian low cost airlines. Overall I would expect more from Star Alliance and Lufthansa group member.",,,,,
"  Flew Austrian airlines return LHR to Bangkok via Vienna with 40 minute connection both ways. Everything was well-organized, our return flight was delayed and we only had 15 minutes to change to LHR plane and we managed to do it, in addition, they held the plane and waited for those of us who were coming to this connection. To add, our bag did not make it to our final connection due to time limitations and they informed us as soon as we landed and delivered it to our home in less than 48 hours! Very impressed. Staff were very friendly on all the flights and did their best to make our journey comfortable. The food was just okay, vegetarian to suit everyone. There is a decent choice of entertainment, but could always improve!",,,,,
"  Terrible service. Thé lady at the check out wasn’t even looking at me when I check in, she was busy talking to her colleague. Then she forced me to check in my luggage cabin which was 9.9 kilos , authorized weight is 10 kg. She said even business class people I don’t allow this, so you can imagine for economy class as yourself. That was very downgrading.",,,,,
"  I was a passenger on a flight OS 0392 (Barcelona - Vienna) and I had a ticket that included a connecting flight to Sarajevo (OS 0757). The flights were booked together in one single ticket. The take-off of the flight from Barcelona was delayed, and we got late to our transfer flight from Vienna to Sarajevo which was scheduled at 12:55 pm, together with the other 7 passengers. During the flight, we were told to go to gate G36 as quickly as possible so I ran first because I have the EU passport so I can tell them to wait for my colleagues who have non EU passport. I arrived first, and there was 7 minutes until the take off, but we were denied boarding even though there would be enough time for us to enter the plane. We were told to go to G4 to get our flight rebooked and it was rebooked to all of us. I noticed that for the other transfer flights, the staff from Vienna airport were waiting for the passengers and directed them to the gate. I don't know and can't understand why that wasn't a case for us, because that would help us to make it on time. The passengers of different flights should have the same conditions so they can enjoy the same rights. According to EU REGULATION EC 261 I have the right to claim a compensation of 250 euros and I will definitely ask for that.  In addition, 10 euros isn't enough for a daily meal and a drink at Vienna airport because of the high prices.  Also, when I picked my suitcase at Sarajevo Airport, a wheel was missing and since I didn't report it at the airport, they refused to give me any kind of reimbursement.",,,,,
"  Athens to Vienna wasn't too bad but Vienna to Newark was a nightmare. Having to walk down the planes steps in the rain, herded onto a bus (the driver drove recklessly) then having to fight to see our gate # and finally loaded on another bus!? The gate was total chaos. The employees never announced they were boarding and it was a crush to get thru where we had to check in for a 2nd time. The plane trip was uncomfortable even with the upgrade. A totally bad experience.",,,,,
"  Short flight from Vienna to Rome. I had no issue but tolerance of excessive carry-ons led to a mad scramble slightly delaying takeoff. Crew was very nice. I had a recurring bout of back pain, and we had to go down a very long flight of stairs to a door, board a bus, then climb more stairs to the airplane. Not friendly for the mobility limited passenger.",,,,,
"  Worst customer service at the boarding area, personnel on boarding gate are so rude, needs to be thought good manners, doesn't even ask nicely and demanding, from the person who demanded to check in the luggage, he said he is the supervisor.

  I booked a flight on their plane and it took off late so I missed my plane from Vienna to Cairo and they refused to book a direct flight for me. I had to wait all night and then they sent me to Germany and I waited two hours at Frankfurt Airport and then another flight to Cairo. I had my wife and 3 year old daughter. It was the hardest trip in my life and after all that they didn't ship the bags until two days after arriving,,,,,

"  I don't recommend flying with Austrian airlines. They provided a connecting flight from Dubrovnik to Amsterdam and did not allow sufficient time to make the transfer in Vienna. The flight landed on time and we ran the whole way to make the second flight but the door was closed right in front of our faces. The airline sold a connecting flight with no time to make the next one. Several others also didn't make the connecting flight. This ruined our last day traveling through Europe and now we're at risk of missing our flight from Amsterdam to the US. Do not fly with Austrian, especially if it's a connecting flight. I truly don't understand why they would sell a flight knowing people wouldn't make it.",,,,,
" I flew back to Montreal last Saturday with OS. I could not believe my eyes and ears when we were told the seats at our gate were reserved for business class passengers only and that we had to stand or find other seats elsewhere. Over 75% of the seats remained empty until boarding. No other flights in this area had the section cordoned off. People were pretty upset and the poor agent got an ear full. In my opinion, this is not acceptable and very upsetting and discriminatory.",,,,,
"  
The connection flight was delayed. I had 3h to wait on airport instead of 1h. Then my luggage didn’t come with this flight, so I had to wait another 3h for another flight with my luggage. They said its better to wait because my luggage will not be delivered to my address in 7 days. The place for waiting had only vending machines, no food at all! Terrible experience for such a short flight! It took a a whole day to travel from Zagreb to Berlin.",,,,,
" My flight from Belgrade to Vienna was a morning flight. The departure was on time and we also landed on time in Vienna. The plane was clean and the seats were comfortable.

 Hamburg to Brussels via Vienna. Boarding in Hamburg caused some delay as the flight was nearly full and once again a lot of people with oversized cabin luggage. Nice breakfast was offered including some hot items. Friendly FA. The connection in Vienna was easy and flight to Brussels was done in an Embraer. Unfortunately the plane was not on a gate. Purser was very friendly and a good hot meal was served with the choice of several Austria wines. Unfortunately for all the passengers doing the flight ex Hamburg the luggage was not loaded in Vienna. My luggage was delivered at home next day at 5pm - a shame I would give Austrian an 8 but now a 6 for the delayed luggage.,,,,,
"  Terrible baggage handling experience. Austrian (or Vienna Airport or Berlin Brandenburg airport, I'm not sure) lost my baggage. That being said, it is the airline that is responsible for retrieving this baggage. Austrian has done nothing to help me get my baggage back. It has been more than 1 month, and I have not heard anything back despite my 50+ calls, emails, contact forms, complaints, tweets, and so on. They have not even been able to give me information about reimbursing my expenses for what I had to buy in the meantime to replace what was in my suitcase. Austrian is expensive like a tier-1 airline (and advertises itself as such), but treats its passengers like Ryanair passengers. I have issued a complaint with the US DOT and the European Commission Mobility and Transport.",,,,,
"  Both on the way to and from Tel Aviv my flights were overbooked and someone had to take their hand luggage into the belly with the other luggage. From Vienna to Copenhagen this ended up being me. Having wasted 40 minutes (almost the same length as the flight) waiting just to get my hand luggage, because they overbook it every time. They need to change how much luggage you can bring without being charged or do it some other way. I don't think it's acceptable to make people waste 40 minutes because they don't have the capacity for the luggage they promised.",,,,,
" Vienna to Montreal. It is ridiculous that in 2022, you are not able to let passengers check in with a Permanent Resident status in Canada online. It is time consuming at the airport, seat cannot be selected because check-in works only at the airport, and I am wasting my time at the airport because the system is not working online. I called the support service and I am just told to check in at the airport. Very frustrating and not very customer friendly.",,,,,

My luggage was returned to me 3 days later. And lo and behold, my luggage was lost on the return trip back to Amsterdam. It has now been 3 weeks and I have had absolutely no update whatsoever on my luggage as to the whereabouts, and all my attempts at contacting the airline to find out what is happening and find out where I can receive compensation for the costs of buying basically a whole new wardrobe have been for naught because customer service does not exist with this airline. I'm reluctant to even start an insurance claim for the damages done because the process may take months at this rate due to how utterly hopeless this airline is. ",,,,,
" Quick update to my last review of Austrian Airlines. So after waiting for my luggage for half my holidays, Austrian told me they would deliver my luggage today.

When I contacted them I was told I was to take a taxi at my own expense to come retrieve the luggage in the warehouse of the local agency in the middle of nowhere in a foreign country!

Not only I had the displeasure of being informed upon landing that my luggage had not been loaded (although as a business class it was marked as a « priority luggage) but since then it has been nothing but impossible to reach their customer service. The Concierge at the hotel I am staying has been calling them non-stop for the past 3 days without success. I emailed them left and right and only to be greeted with non-sensical half-baked generic apologies from a no-reply automated server. And to top it off, not only this incompetent bunch has just ruined half of my holidays, but they do not even guarantee customers to reimburse them for damages to your belongings nor for additional essentials purchases.

Rang the bell asked what the temperature was set to learned it was 24. 24 is ridiculous. Austrian does not have individual air vents. After arguing with the purser for over 10 minutes she agreed to lower it to 22. I argued this was not enough and argued there was no way I could sleep in such a hot cabin. She then said, 'do you feel how cold I am? I'm freezing'. So because the purser is cold the whole cabin has to suffer in a sauna-like environment on a 10 hour flight. I've written letters to the standard customer service team, and have forwarded comment to the head of operations asking what the policy is for cabin temperature. 4 weeks later no response. Even though I think the products and service are generally better on international airlines, I simply can't trust then to have a reasonable cabin temperature.",,,,,
"  From the moment I purchased my ticket for a business trip to Berlin and subsequent environmental fieldwork in Scandinavia, I've only run into problem after problem with this surprisingly incompetent airline. First, they informed me that my return flight had been canceled. After over a dozen phone calls over the course of a week - that is, sitting on hold for over an hour to never actually reach a customer service agent, someone finally picked up the phone and I managed to re-book another flight. Then on my outbound flight on August 6, they lost my luggage, sending me an email two days later that they had located it and handed it over to the delivery company. Three weeks later, after countless (unanswered) phone calls, emails, and online forms, I still hadn't received my luggage, only to find out that the delivery company (CLS Express - also impossible to get in touch with) had, in fact, never received my luggage. I was forced to purchase new items of clothing, shoes, and field gear (over $1000), as I had nothing with me for my month-long trip. I never received any feedback from Austrian Airlines regarding reimbursement or compensation of any sort. Furthermore, to say that the ""Lost and Found"" at the Berlin Airport is utterly useless is an understatement, as they - after making you wait in line for over 45 minutes - just refer you to the Austrian Airlines website to submit a claim. I had initially booked Austrian Airlines for my business trip thinking it was a quality company I could rely on. In my 15 years of international (and overseas) travel - both personal and business, with a multitude of different airlines - I have never run into so many issues with a single flight, or such disastrous customer service. Needless to say, this was my first and last time traveling with them. ",,,,,
"  Our flight from Stockholm was delayed with 10-15 minutes, therefore our baggage didn’t make it to our connecting flight - which is understandable. However, it has taken us four days to get any update about our baggage which was originally said to reach out hotel in 1-2 days. After calling a couple of times we got an update that our baggage where handed over to a currier and will reach us in 1-2 days (4-5 days upon arrival). They also promised to updated us by phone or email which they haven’t done a single time during these five days. They are not able to give us any information about the company who is handling the currier. I can not understand how this is not a prioritised matter to the airline?! They say that they will reimburse any necessary cost, which is reasonable, but not for over six days - since some things is not replaceable when abroad. This is horrible treatment, they promise things they can’t stand by and doesn’t seem to care.",,,,,
"  Austrian Airlines made the return trip from Mallorca unpleasant for us with its one-hour delay to Vienna. In the plane, except for a glass of water, everything is paid for by card, including coffee, which the airline should offer free of charge for an hour's flight delay. As a result, we missed the reserved seats on the bus to Bratislava. We had to urgently look for an alternative connection at the airport in Schwechat. If we didn't find anything, we would be forced to take a taxi all the way to Bratislava, and Austrian Airlines would definitely not reimburse us for that. We will never travel with Austrian Airlines again, we would rather not go on vacation. They should improve to a great extent. Spiatočnú cestu z Malorky nám zneprijemnila letecká spoločnosť Austrian Airlines svojím neuvedeným hodinovým meškaním do Viedne. V lietadle okrem pohár vody sa za všetko platí kartou, aj za kávu, ktorú by mala letecká spoločnosť ponúknuť bezplatne za hodinové meškanie letu. Tým pádom sme zmeškali rezervovane miesta v autobuse do Bratislavy. Museli sme narýchlo hľadať náhradný spoj na letisku na Schwechate. Keby sme nič nenašli, boli by sme nútené ísť taxíkom až do Bratislavy a to by nám Austrian Airlines určite nerefundoval. Už nikdy viac s Austrian Airlines nebudeme cestovať, radšej nepôjdeme na dovolenku. Mali by sa zlepšiť a to vo veľkej miere. ",,,,,
  The crew onboard was friendly and polite. The flight was on time and even landed before scheduled arrival time. I would give this airline company a higher rating if it weren’t for the meals they serve onboard. The food in the economy class is literally uneatable. The pasta penne was soaked in water with a disgusting sauce on top. The dessert cake as hard as a rock. My seat neighbors could not eat the food either. Considering the price of the plane ticket this is absolutely unacceptable! I would not recommend this airline to anyone unless you don’t mind bringing your own food onboard.,,,,,
"  I had 2 checked luggages and the lady at check-in convinced me to check one of my hand luggages for free. She even offered to check in my daughter's stroller. Very kind of her. Thankfully, I kept the stroller because I needed it at the lay-over in Vienna. When I landed in Tirana, neither of my checked luggages came with me. The smaller luggage came after 2 days, one of the checked bags came after 3 days and the other big luggage still missing after 1 week.  So, half of my daughter's clothes, all the supplements and anti-pyretics I got in case my daughter got sick during our trip, and all of my clothing and shoes, altogether with some gifts I got for the people we were going to visit, lost in that luggage. They tell me to send the receipts for the replacement items. What about all I spent to get the luggage and what I have in it? What about all the frustration and the wasted time to find clothes for us when we could be enjoying our vacation as we were supposed to? Our vacation was ruined and all what Austrian airlines customer support tells you is to file the missing luggage report online and the replacement items form online and that's all. The seats were so tight that you had no room for the arms. The meal was horrible.  At least the coffee was good. I had to remind the flight attendants to give my daughter the crackers and the meal she was entitled to, even though she had her own seat paid at full price. This was my first time traveling with this company and it's going to be the last.",,,,,
"  Their online system appears to have a massive defect which would cause a tremendous issue. After issuing the reservation that I have provided documentation of, I received a note that appeared to be a scam, claiming my credit card had not approved the charge for the flights I had received confirmation of. Checking my credit card statement, I was charged for the tickets. When contacting Austrian, they stated that having not been paid their system canceled my flights without notifying me. However, their agent then confirmed they had indeed billed my card and their charge was in fact being held against my card. Their agent admitted that they were utterly befuddled by the numerous errors within their system, the error in cancelling my flights, the error in stating they had not been paid, the error in not notifying me of a cancellation, etc. Essentially, she was polite, but could not sort out any reason for the numerous mistakes Austrian had made. I have blocked payment to Austrian and booked another airline as I cannot risk failing to reach Vienna for a business meeting. This should serve as a cautionary tale to check, verify, investigate, and take any other action possible to ensure Austrian has not failed spectacularly in what should be a trivial business transaction. ",,,,,
"  It´s not the first time I have a luggage lost, but Austrian is by far the worst company I have to deal with. They lost my 4 luggage in Vienna and after 8 days, they are still lost. No information, No excuses, impossible to join by any means. The worst airline company ever.",,,,,
  Baggage has been lost for seven days and you cannot  get in contact with with anyone and there has been no communication. It has ruined our vacation. I understand if there was communication being made but there has been nothing. Worst customer service.,,,,,
"  This was our first experience with Austrian Airlines and it was memorable for all of the wrong reasons. Delays, missed connecting flights, lost luggage, rude service agents. Finally made it to our destination over 24 hours later than scheduled. Luggage is still lost and the website tracking system is absolutely no help. Quite simply, we will never fly with Austrian Airlines again even if it means paying more money to a different airline or taking a longer route to get there. This was my worst experience with an airline in more than 30 years of international travel.",,,,,
 Amman to Stockholm via Vienna. One of the worst flights that I had in my entire life! The customer service is very poor and no one is answering me. They lost my bags and didn’t even bother searching for them or updates me about the situation. Will never ever travel with them again.,,,,,
"  The airline did not transfer my bags from the Vienna leg of my trip. When I arrived at LAX my bag was not on the plane. There were at least 20-30 other people on my flight that did not receive their bags. I was unable to obtain my bag to recheck it onto my domestic flight for the final leg with United Airlines. Since my final leg was with United I could not file a claim with Austrian Airlines. Both of my bags are sitting in Vienna. I am on day six with no bags and no word, despite completing the required claims forms. This is ridiculous. I was in Europe for six weeks and nearly all my clothes are in those bags. The airline is simply not doing what it should be doing to ensure passenger bags are delivered. They are either over-committed on their flights or severely understaffed, either way, the airline obviously does not care about getting bags delivered on time when people depend on them. I would recommend NOT using Austrian Airlines or their affiliate Lufthansa if you want your bags to accompany you on your trip. On a side note, my bags were delayed 8 days on my outbound trip. As an additional comment, the service on the plane was also substandard. The flight attendants were not friendly, appeared annoyed by their responsibilities, and the restrooms were filthy by mid-flight. I saw a flight attendant look inside one of the bathrooms curiously and with visible disgust, but no one ever cleaned it. The main meal was not bad but subsequent snacks and small meals were nothing more than a slice of meat and a slice of cheese on doughy bread. ",,,,,
" We boarded Milan 8pm, arrived in Austria 10pm. Luggage was checked all the way to LAX. We had a 15 hr layover in Vienna - upon arriving to LAX on August 2nd our luggage was missing - two days later and they have no clue where our 5 pieces of luggage are and I have not received any updates. This is not the business seat service I paid for.",,,,,
" First time with Austrian Airlines and it will definitely be my last. My flight was Venice to Dubrovnik with a layover in Vienna. Their customer service is a joke, they all just have scripted answers and redirect you to fill out forms on the website. It’s like talking to a robot. I’ve called numerous times without any success. You request for a supervisor and they say there is none available no matter when you call. I held for an hour today. My partner and I were on a week long trip across Europe and I was planning to propose in Dubrovnik, but then Austrian Airlines have “delayed” our luggage when we had landed and most likely lost the luggage. My proposal and trip has now been ruined as my partner had to return to Seattle for their portion of the trip for work. While I had to spend a full day of my remaining vacation spending extra money on getting new clothes toiletries because I’m going to be here for four more weeks across European countries which I’m told they’re going to only reimburse 50% of clothes and 100% of toiletries but it’s probably going to be a great hassle to get out of them considering everything else lately. I’m never checking a bag again because of this and encourage no one else to ask well. This is gross negligence and they take no accountability or action. Even when I did check in my baggage I had issues as well. I tried to buy online for 30 per bag and the website kept giving an error which I showed the error and charges to the check in at the airport and she still did not honor the price and made us pay 50.00 per bag to then lose said bags and destroy a proposal and vacation. Now I’m spending half my time on vacation, stressed out, trying to do everything I can to at least have my bags found and sent home and there is zero assistance by Austrian. Never fly with them and I would definitely suggest never checking your baggage!",,,,,
"  Do not fall for the 45 minute layover in Vienna. We travelled within the EU, and still had to run from the gate to passport control then a km to the surprise additional security check, back to the same airplane to catch the connecting flight. With a baby. Not to mention this was a different experience during the departure trip (to the same country but different airport - had to change terminals, despite the same airline, and go through passport control but no additional security check). Friendly staff onboard though.",,,,,
"  Austrian Airlines put me and my partner on standby status. Thankfully we managed to fly out on the allocated flight. However, we did not get seats on the inbound flight and returned to Manchester via Zurich on a much later flight. Secondly, Austrian Airlines said I had not paid to carry luggage in the hold. I clearly had paid the additional fee in advance and had to provide a copy of my invoice to substantiate the fact. Austrian Airlines lost our luggage. We were not reunited with the luggage throughout the entirety of our four days in Vienna. It was only when physically searching a lost luggage warehouse at Vienna Airport that we found our luggage. This was on the morning of our departure. It was impossible to get in touch with the airline while we were in Vienna, either by allocated phone number of e mail. A complaint made to the airline on 13/07/22 requesting repayment for clothing and toiletries that had to be bought while in Vienna, has not been responded to. It is approaching three weeks without response from Austrian Airlines. I am very disappointed with Austrian Airlines. It is as if the airline do not acknowledge our existence. It is my experience that Austrian Airlines are very poor at customer service.",,,,,
" The worst I have ever tried. The food was very cold, airplane was not clean, they lost my luggage, when they found it they did not offer any delivery, instead asking me to come back to the airport in Amman while I live in Palestine. You will not be able to talk to any human being their chat system is useless they do not answer any call.",,,,,
"  I booked Amsterdam to Ho Chi Minh City via Vienna and Bangkok at Austrian Airlines. The first two flights were operated by Austrian Airlines and the last part was code-shared with Thai Smile Airways. Once we arrived at SGN we discovered damage on one of the bags. We went to the baggage desk and filled in a form. Photos of the damage were taken. We went on holiday and after returning home I send in a form to Austrian Airlines. I got a case number and then for 6 weeks did not hear a thing. When I emailed for a reminder I got a short email back saying I have to go to Thai Smiles since they caused the damaged, also saying Austrian is not responsible and Austrian refers to their own rules. I asked again by email for a proper argument (I explained the damage could have occurred at Amsterdam, Vienna or Bangkok and that I have a booking with Austrian Airlines and not Thai Smile). Then I got an email saying that they refer to their first answer and that this will be their last communication with me. What a rude way to take care of your customers. So here I am with a bag (€160) which can't be used anymore. Austrian Airlines lost me as a customer",,,,,
"  My flight was good, both were. Cabin crew was nice and helpful. Even the food was ok, I ordered special gluten free meal and my travel partner had pasta. Leg room in the first, small plane (Embraer) was like really good. In the Boeing 777 it was comparable with the other air lines. Flights left on time. Overall that was one of my best flights in recent years. One thing to flag is that there was no WIFI though it should have been. And the second meal was only a sandwich and little desert, could be more.",,,,,
"  This was the cheapest and poorest service we have ever had in our life, no simple services like beverages, and cold water was with a purchase option only, otherwise you get the warm water with no ice. The crew did not care if we had small ones that needed more water, you have to always ask again and again and you get that half plastic cup. For someone who travels often, this was a really bad experience and one of the worst services I have had, travelling in a bus or a train would've been a better experience. ",,,,,
"  Austrian Airlines cancelled my connecting flight from Vienna to Brussels and refused to give me a hotel voucher or a free meal. I wasn't informed of this cancelation until I was ready to board the plane to Austria. The staff was extremely rude and dismissive and the lady at the counter started yelling at me when I asked for more information on my connecting flight. I was obliged to go back to departures where I found out that there are no representatives of Austrian Airlines working at Oslo airport. The information desk gave me a German number and asked me to call and solve the problem myself. After waiting for a long time on the phone, I was told that my flight to Brussels would take place, four days later. No other solutions were offered by Austrian Airlines. It was the most disrespectful attitude I've ever witnessed at an airport. I eventually paid for a new flight with Norwegian Airlines and I flew to my destination the next morning. I highly recommend that you choose another company for your travels as Austrian Airlines is extremely unreliable.",,,,,
"  Worst customer service ever! After receiving an email that my return flight was cancelled, it was absolutely impossible to get in touch with Customer Service. I tried calling the numbers listed online several days in a row, however, to no avail, as I was kept on hold for over an hour each time, after which I hung up. They do not respond to emails, and take over a week to respond to messages sent via the online form on their website (which is unacceptable, considering the time-sensitive nature of rebooking flights for business trips). Would not recommend or travel with them again.",,,,,
  We landed 3 weeks ago in Amsterdam and are still waiting for our luggage. Impossible to reach customer service. No communication whatsoever. Come on Austrian Airlines! Take your responsibility.,,,,,
  It's 8th days since I hand my family 6 baggages to Austrian Airlines and missing since then. I have been calling every day but they are not willing to provide update. This is the worst airline experience I have had. Austrian Airlines where's our baggage? We have the right to know.,,,,,
  I booked my flight three month in advance. My flight got delayed for two hours causing me to miss my last flight to the final destination. Both flights were Austrian Airlines. I received a hotel voucher but this does not change the fact that I missed a very important day. They rebooked me automatically and in the end I have to take two more flights.,,,,,
"  Purchased a ticket that included one check-in bag (I have written confirmation of this) and was charged 50 Euro for my check-in bag at the airport. The flight was already overpriced but +50 Euro was ridiculous. The flight was not a pleasant experience, I asked the ground staff if I had to wear a mask on board, and they said no, the pilot was very rude to me as I boarded for not having a mask on. Service on board was at the best ordinary, unfriendly crew, my seat was uncomfortable and my tray did not appear to have been cleaned. I can genuinely say I truly dislike Austrian Airlines. From start to finish it was not a nice experience, I would never fly with them again.",,,,,
  We are traveling family group of four. First thing Austrian Airlines canceled our flight without informing us because they oversold the flight. Second they put us on a flight to Chicago instead of Las Vegas which is the longest route to Las Vegas. The worst thing they didn't ship our bags with us and lost in transit. We have been calling and emailing them every day but not willing to provide update. This airline customer service is the worst and the employees have no any customer service skills. It's five days since we arrived in Vegas without our baggage and begging for our baggage but American Airlines informed us that our baggage is still in Vienna. What is going on with Austrian Airline to keep our baggage in Vienna? ,,,,,
"  Absolutely the worst experience and customer service. Missed our connecting flight because initial flight was delayed which caused me to miss an event and spend an extra 10 hours and an extra flight before arriving to my destination. After speaking to the customer service desk, they offered 4 Euros for my inconvenience which couldn’t even buy a coffee at the airport. I have sent 3 emails with no response, spoke to one customer service agent who hung up after I told him my dilemma and being on hold for 20 minutes. I have now tried calling again multiple times with no answer.",,,,,
  Do not fly this airline! Your baggage will be lost. I’m at a winery in Tuscany and every person in four groups with about twelve people flew Austrian Airlines into Florence and no one received their bags. They have horrible customer service and every contact you get will send you to another contact to call. No one claims they can do anything about it. You can call. You can email. You can use their chat feature. No one will be able to assist. They should not be allowed to offer a service to check bags if they can not keep up with them.,,,,,
"  Cost cutting to the max. The inflight service has now reached the bottom. No more choice of meals, just a mini portion of salad, cheese pasta without salt or pepper. A mini sandwich as a second meal during a 9h flight. ",,,,,
"  They fell to the lowest level possible. Dirty seats, greasy windows and walls, ultra budget service for not so cheap tickets, very nonchalant approach to covid safety measures, masks not obligatory, they don't give away masks to passengers who don't have one. This was my last time flying with this airline.",,,,,
"  Having purchased a business ticket at a rather hefty price I was surprised to learn the aircraft did not have any proper business seating neither when I asked they had a simple blanket nor a pillow. Having arrived after a few unpleasant hours to Geneva I have learned my suitcases were untraceable, long story short after almost 3 days I still did not receive my suitcases and no one reached out to inform me about their status. Having perishable goods in former luggage and having to travel inside EU, it was certainly one of the worst experiences I had for travelling such a short distance. Worst part was neglecting of both airlines and Swisspost bag handling team, very unprofessional and unamicable.",,,,,
"  I would recommend Austrian. Excellent service, on time, Vienna airport is excellent without delays. I traveled business. Easy online checkin",,,,,
  The flight from Chicago to Vienna was great. The flight attendants were wonderful. The trouble started in Vienna. The security staff are the prime example of what happened when you give a small amount of authority to stupid people. They were awful. Barking orders and to be honest trying to delay us out of just sheer pettiness. Terrible experience. Flight was good again but our bags never arrived. Found out later that no one’s luggage arrived. 3 days on my 10 day vacation and still wearing the same clothes. Luggage still hasn’t arrived.,,,,,
" I've been flying AUA for years now, since they have been accommodating and reliable for most of the time. So I did again, for our flight back from Thessaloniki to Vienna. I purposely don't book cheaper airlines to avoid cancellations. This time it was different, on the evening before our flight, they got cancelled, we instead got a flight from Thessaloniki to Athens, from Athens to Zürich with 6+ hours layover and then Zürich - Vienna. This flight was impossible for us to reach since the earliest bus from the northern province city would not reach that connection in time. So on top of paying the bus in vain, we got to spend 1 hour in the Austrian hotline plus another half an hour on the phone corresponding with the (kind) lady there. After a tedious search for an alternative, we managed to get a flight from the local airport in Kavala with a 9 hour layover in Stuttgart, to finally arrive in Vienna over 12 hours later. I paid 200+ euros for flights that I could have had for 50€ or less with the cheaper competitors to not have stuff like this happen. AUA management is behaving like a cheap airline and I cannot recommend them anymore due to these practises. One thing I have to say, to make a fun point after this extremely unenjoyable experience: At least they are behaving like true Austrian leadership. Kudos to that. Refund my bus tickets at least. For a state funded airline, this is unacceptable.",,,,,
"  Truly zero star experience on Lufthansa booked through Austrian Airlines. When I checked in online, I received a boarding card for a different flight. The evening before departure the flight was suddenly canceled, no reason given and no alternative flight. When I called  (30 minutes waiting) in Vienna they rebooked me on another flight. I tried to do another online checkin, but got only errors on the site. I tried to call again but nobody was available. So I had no boarding card yet when I went to Schiphol the next morning. In the night I got a reminder that the flight was almost fully booked and they urged me to check in. But I could not as there was an error on the website when doing so. The next morning I was at the checkin and they said the flight was full as I did not check in on time (I was there 2 hours before departure). So I had to cancel my trip as there was no other flight available the same day.",,,,,
"  Non-existing customer service. Stroller was delivered damaged and one suitcase is still missing. Been trying to get a hold of the airline for two weeks through numerous phone calls, submitting inquiries on website, two different email addresses and still haven’t been able to reach anyone. + 1 hour each time in phone que that ended up in Austin’s red message that “they can not take my call right now and to try to call back later”. Would not recommend.",,,,,
" 12 hour flights are going to be rough, that is a given. The airline industry even found ways to make long flights more uncomfortable as they have tried to respond effectively with Covid. Some background: I am 6’3” and a little claustrophobic. I look for every opportunity not to wear a mask. I don’t like it when the passenger in front of me puts their chair back as far as it will go into my face. But I know going in a 12 hour flight is not going to be a picnic. This flight was no picnic, but it was alright. Premium economy was an expensive choice, but it guaranteed more comfort. The seat in front of me was all the way back most the flight, but magical seat configuration made that less of an issue. Plenty of leg room. The food was good and they fed us at decent intervals. The flight attendants were nice. They provided noise canceling headphones, which was a nice touch, though I never used them because I could find nothing on their entertainment that I wanted to watch more than what I had on my iPad. The worst part of the trip was the Los Angeles traffic after we touched down.",,,,,
" OS858 from TLV to VIE. The flight had a delay of 70 minutes, but the crew informed transparently and provided additional information about connecting flights to passengers with tight connections. This information was also available for free during the flight using the Austrian onboard WiFi service. Boarding was smooth and fast and the crew were excellent. A warm early dinner was served. It consisted of a pasta dish, warm bread, and some cake for dessert. All of it was well prepared and tasty. All in all an excellent flight.",,,,,
"  Bad service, uninterested crew. It was a flight from Amsterdam to Vienna to Sofia May 22nd 2022. The first flight was delayed with 1,5 hour. No information given. During the flight we heard that the connection to Sofia already left. In Vienna no  help at all, they didn't care that you missed your flight. No one to help or to guide you. ""go there, go there"" that was it. At all the desks I was accused I was too late.  Eventually they rebooked me on a flight from 04.00 PM. After boarding there were some computer problems. Waited for one hour - no information given - then they told us the flight is cancelled and we had to get off the plane again. And the crew had the nerve to tell us to have a nice day and see you back soon! Back at the airport uninterested staff told us that there were no flights anymore that night. They could give me a hotel and the next day with Lufthansa to Paris, and from Paris to Sofia.  I checked the internet there were also direct flights to Sofia. In the end I could go with a flight from 09.00 PM that night because they put me on a waiting list, but only after I did not accept their offer for a hotel. I had a 16 hour journey instead of a 5 hour journey that day because of the incompetence of Austrian. And again the worst thing was their lack of interest; they gave me a feeling they didn't want me as a customer, they only want my money. No service or compassion at all. Needless to say I will never go back with Austrian.",,,,,
  Avelo Airlines is another hustling cheap tickets like Spirit and Frontier. It really how you search for cheap tickets if is still available or not. There days that their prices is the same as any airlines. Remember Avelo charge for customer service so another gold digger.,,,,,
" Avelo sent discounts promo code like summer 23 or Finals50, Jet setter which all this codes purpose be 50% off the tickets at is available. Yes they have expiration day to make the reservation but they don't or give you accepting day, long story short they send you all this ads to your email and when you applied the code it don't work and had to call customer for help and they can't even don't know or don't know what to do. Just waste of time trying to book with them. I look at this new airlines company Avelo like Spirit or Frontier hustling people to fly with them. We know Spirits and Frontier Airlines are, there services and prices that people really not happy just little bit of saving that people get out of it. At end Avelo airlines is doing the same hustling people that flying with them is cheap but they really Not! They no different from Spirit and Frontier Airlines.",,,,,
" Avelo has many advantages but their ""personal"" item is so small that neither my purse on one flight, nor my briefcase on another, qualified because they did not fit in the EXACT dimensions (and the flight attendant took out a tape measure in Ft. Myers both times!!). Both were over by 1"". In Wilmington, DE, they were not picky, but in Ft. Myers, they were AND if you did not purchase overhead storage--no matter how much extra there was, they would not let you put it there. They have the SMALLEST dimensions of of a personal item in the entire industry and it is really ridiculous.",,,,,
" We, a family of three had an afternoon flight from New Haven to RDU on 7/16/23. We took the train from NYC and rode the bus to HVN. When we arrived at the gate, we were told the flight was canceled because of weather. However the airport was flooded since the morning. I do not know why we got the notification so late. If we were notified early, we could stay in NYC and arranged alternative much easier. Now we had to go back to NYC and try to take the overnight bus home because there were no other options. It cost us extra hundreds of dollar and a painful journey. Also, the rebooking option from the cancelation notification text does not allow us to book any later day’s flight even though some are available from Avelo’s website. The entire week after was greyed out. I tried to call customer service rep but was on hold for an hour and was disconnected. It was very frustrating experience.",,,,,
  It’s cheap. The employees must be bound by strict policies because they seem like nice people. It’s ridiculously not customer friendly. I’m on a mostly empty flight but to switch seats costs $54. They strictly enforce the checked bag (which cost more than the ticket) at 50 pounds.  One way they didn’t say anything about my backpack. The same backpack on the way back they want to charge me for a carry on. The advertised price is not the price. Your enjoyment of the flight is not their priority. BUT I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 because it’s cheap. If the prices ever increase I’d avoid them like the plague.,,,,,
  This airline has horrible customer service. They made me pay for a carry on with a backpack that was not even questioned on the way down to Fort Myers. Do not fly this airline. They do not care about their customers and charge unnecessary fees. Not worth “saving” money on a ticket...because you don’t. Terrible experience.,,,,,
" I highly suggest you not use this airline. The fact that my husband and I were refused on the flight because we weren’t there 3 1/2 hours before our flight and had time to make it to the flight still was not ok. The airport was not busy whatsoever. Then the team lead, or whatever she was, was rude to us. So much for customer service or even just human decency. It’s not that hard to be kind to one another. Especially in the early morning when no one wants to be up. Then the fact that she canceled the flight right in front of us and offered us a ridiculous option to reschedule when this is the only week we could’ve gone. Then told us we’d get a full refund only to find out we couldn’t. Just know if you want a full refund that you need to run in circles to find someone to actually care about your issue. Don’t use Avelo unless you want to be treated like nothing but waste! Spend the extra money and go somewhere that cares for you!",,,,,
" Go, Go Avelo! This was the most pleasant flight experience that I’ve had in decades. From the check in, boarding, the friendly, professional staff and the spotless cabin, it was wonderful. I was also impressed with the exterior of the plane. She was gorgeous, no dents or rusted rivets, and it looked like it had just rolled out of the factory! Part of the great experience was also the Wilmington and Charleston airports.",,,,,
" I was apprehensive based on reviews but our experience was great. We checked a bag and the check-in was seamless. I would recommend arriving early since the employees who check-in are the same that do the boarding process. Everyone we spoke to was super nice including gate agents, flight attendants, and check in folks. We weren't expecting much in-flight but I thought the seats were fine. Plenty of leg room and I actually enjoy the no recline. It feels like people are lying in your lap on other airlines. Arrival and departure were on time. We'd fly Avelo again.",,,,,
" Avelo is new to Wilmington DE. Avelo did an awesome job with leaving and getting there on time both ways. Sent out text for checking in. Checking in a checked bag went well with no issues. Paid for a carry on for meds, swim suit/change of clothes. Also took a small back pack for the I-pad, book, snacks that fit under the seat. No snacks offered, but a small bottle of water if you ask for it. Lead flight attendant did an awesome job getting a few people in line who kept getting up when the seat belt sign was on. I would use them again. Both ways they had a new flight attendant and they were very nice working with her to get her qualified. Now the Wilmington Airport is a different story. It is a small airport where you get on/off on the tarmac which is no big deal. On the return flight home, there was another Avelo plane a that just landed. When you walked into the area to get you baggage, it was jammed pack with people. 2 door slide up and bags where placed through the opening with everyone trying to see their bag. 2 planes worth of people. What a mess. It took 45 minutes by the time we were off the plane until we got our luggage. At one point they were loading stuff from one cart to another. It would of been easier if they did not have 2 planes unloading at the same time Yes we would fly with them again. Just have to have patience at Wilmington, DE airport.",,,,,
"  Avelo used to be great. When it started it was a lot cheaper and way more reliable. Now flights cost almost as much as a normal non-budget airline, and almost every time I have flown we have been delayed. I am currently waiting for my flight to Burbank and before today we received three emails in the last week that notified us that flight times were changed, and since sitting in the airport we have gotten three more emails. We are now over 3 hours delayed. No one is telling us anything. Just a more expensive version of Ryanair.",,,,,
" Well suppose to depart 8:30 am, first delay to 10:30, 2nd delay to 11:30, 3rd delay to 11:45, now 12:59 - where does it end? So many delays, finding out from the internet, no one from Avelo says anything to all of us passengers. Fly Spirit from Atlantic city - much more reliable.",,,,,
"  Do not book with Avelo if you even think you may have to adjust your trip. The wording on their refund policy is sneaky. Unless you cancel within 24 hours of your initial booking you get locked into having ""Travel Credits"". Additionally, like Spirit Airlines, they ding you with every fee possible for baggage. Do not recommend at all.",,,,,
"  You may be asking yourself why are Avelo flights so cheap? It is because they do not actually get you anywhere. At least I am convinced of this so far in my experience as I am writing this in the airport after my third delay from Avelo. Reasoning? No staff. And before anyone begins arguing about staffing, I realize there are shortages nationwide but honestly, that’s can’t be an excuse anymore. I work every day with fewer employees than I have had in the past, however, I do not overbook services to the extent that I find myself unable to provide realistic goals for my customers. Get it together Avelo. If you do not have staff, do not continue to book flights! Needless to say, I will never fly Avelo again.",,,,,
" Excellent experience. On time, plenty of room, employees were great. I will fly again. Arrived early both ways and left on time both ways. Checked a bag and paid for overhead storage no issues.",,,,,
"  We took a flight from Tampa to Wilmington at the end of April for a wedding. Never again will I fly Avelo. Our checked bags were lost on the way up. They went to Connecticut. We didn’t get them back the whole trip. We were told by multiple employees “purchase whatever you need, we know you’re here for a wedding”. We bought necessities. Clothes from target so nothing fancy. I bought drugstore makeup, so once again nothing crazy. Basic toiletries so we could shower and wash our hair. But when it came time to get reimbursed we were told they will not cover our toiletries or makeup. I did not want to spend half of our trip buying stuff to be comfortable. I didn’t want to put stuff on credit cards and get charged interest while waiting on payment. I didn’t want to spend the following weeks fighting with the airline over what is owed to us. Don’t fly Avelo. Book the more expensive flight. We are out more money than we would’ve been flying American. You live and you learn I guess.",,,,,
"  This is to address a significant issue experienced by myself and the 17 passengers who were left behind on Flight 745. I had a booking with Avelo (confirmation 8J967D) for a flight on May 22nd, 2023. My girlfriend and I were prepared to leave our home well in advance of the scheduled departure time when we received an email informing us of a 30-minute delay. Subsequently, we received several more emails indicating further delays, a total of eight times. Unfortunately, none of these emails provided any information or alerts regarding the closure time of the TSA checkpoint. We arrived ontime at the airport for our rescheduled flight at 11:45 pm. To my surprise, there was no one present at the Avelo front desk at all. An airport employee approached us and informed us that we had missed our flight because the TSA checkpoint was closed, despite there still being ample time remaining. He stated that the TSA had closed at 9:30 pm, even though there was another flight scheduled for departure. Besides, on the CHO airport, it is clearly stated that ""The daily closing time is dependent on the airline schedule and delays"". More passengers arrived subsequently, with some needing to check in their luggage. However, there was still no one available at the front desk to assist them. After waiting in line for 25 minutes, I managed to reach an Avelo customer service agent over the phone. The lady I spoke with was courteous and assured me that I would be compensated not only for my flight but also for the hotel and any other costs incurred as a result of this incident. Unfortunately, she informed me that there was no alternative way for us to be accommodated on another flight. I made an attempt to contact them, but unfortunately, they changed their words. They simply resorted to using a generic template without addressing any of my specific concerns. It appears that they have a tendency to evade taking responsibility and often attribute the issues to external factors, rather than acknowledging and addressing their own problems. In some cases, they even go as far as abruptly ending phone calls, as if it is a common occurrence for them.",,,,,
"  This was the first time we used Avelo Airlines. I had read some bad reviews, but we thought we’d give it a try because the price was so good, and the airport is more convenient than PHL. We were very happy with both flights. They were on time, and the staff, both in the airports and in flight, were very polite, helpful and considerate. I have already recommended Avelo to our friends and relatives, and will be flying with them again.",,,,,
"  I was a bit wary reading the reviews here after I purchased my one way ticket (I usually book a round trip with one airline but I booked two one way tickets due to the holiday period). Check in crew was fine and had no problems checking my prepaid bag in. Boarding process was a lot less orderly than Southwest and the seating was tight (Avelo does acquire used 737-700s from SWA, but uses another airline to buy 737-800s). I knew they didn’t have snacks so that didn’t bother me. But the flight was bumpy due to the weather and flight attendants were ok. The flight was on time, I made it in one piece and my bag was fine. I recommend this with reservations since they keep SWA competitive pricing wise.",,,,,
 0/10 they delay flights like it’s their job then rush you to board. Worst experience ever. Do not fly Avelo even though the prices are low it’s not worth the hassle. Never again !,,,,,
" Constant mechanical problems which is a huge concern. Both flights (to and from) flight were delayed several times due to mechanical problems. Initially supposed to take off at 9 AM and was delayed 3-4 times. We did not take off until 1 PM. The return flight boarded on time but we are stuck on the plane delayed, taxiing back to the gate for the second time due to a second engine problem.",,,,,
"  We will not be using Avelo Airlines again. We booked round trip flights from Raleigh to Florida months ago. The departing flight was supposed to be on Saturday, May 20th and the return flight was supposed to be on Saturday, May 27th. Now that it's the week of our month's long, planned vacation, our return flight has been bumped up twice by 2 days from the 27th to the 25th. I called customer service to get our return flights cancelled and refunded as we have our house in Florida rented from the 20th through the 27th, and don't want to end our vacation 2 days early. The first customer service representative I spoke to was apologetic and very helpful with cancelling and refunding this flight. Minutes later, I got a confirmation email showing our return flight has been cancelled, except now it was showing our departing flight was scheduled for Friday, May 19th instead of Saturday, May 20th. I called again, and this customer service representative was extremely unhelpful and had an ""it is what it is"" attitude. I was told that to move our flight from the 19th to the 20th, we would incur extra fees, and the seats that we paid extra money for would not be guaranteed. I told her I didn't care about the seats as long as the cost would be refunded, but I would not be paying extra fees to switch my flight back to the 20th as this was an error on their end, not mine. She again tells me refunds would not be guaranteed, and the only way to switch my flight is if I paid an extra fee. I asked if there was someone else I could speak to in regard to refunding and she could not provide me with any information. Then, she proceeds to tell me that my flight cannot be switched from the 19th to the 20th, because there are no flights scheduled from Raleigh to Florida on that date. I don't understand how this is suddenly the case when, for months, our confirmation has shown our departing flight being scheduled on the 20th, and it was only changed to 19th moments after cancelling our return flight. It's just ridiculous. I'm not one to write reviews, negative reviews at that, and I am very reasonable. I understand the customer service reps have no involvement with changing flights, but her lack of compassion and inability to advise me on a solution to a problem created by Avelo, is just ridiculous. I guess you get what you paid for. Never again.",,,,,
"  My wife, daughter, and I, booked round trip flights from CO to CA to go be with my wife’s dying grandmother. We checked in 1:00a the day of online, for an 8:20p flight. We showed up 1.5 - 2 hrs early for the flight. We sat across the terminal walkway at the pizza hut to eat before we took off. We went to the gate 15 min before takeoff. Just to get turned away. Our boarding pass stated that we had to be at the gate 10 min before take off. Without any concern, compassion, or effort to get us on the plane, the staff just stood there and told us to try again and reschedule. BTW, they only fly Thurs and Mon out of CoS. Now to make sure we make it to spend time with Grandma before her time with us expires, we are driving from CoS to Burbank to pick up our two checked bags, then drive back to Riverside to get house where she’s on hospice. Never fly with Avelo, they are awful.",,,,,
  After reading the reviews I was worried my girls was going to have a horrible flight. But to our surprise the crew and plane was amazing. The crew was pleasant and the plane was comfortable. I would love for this airline to fly to more locations so I can use them more often. I will look up this airline first to see if they can accommodate my travel before the big corporation airlines.,,,,,
"  If you ever have to cancel your flight, they will conveniently lose your travel funds and you’ll never see them again. I spent countless hours sending them the proof that they owed me travel funds and they just said that they couldn’t find them and that it was the customers responsibility to keep track. What a joke I sent everything that they had sent me. how can I give them travel funds numbers to research what’s owed to me if they never gave them to me in the first place. Customer service is inadequate and in accurate and they do not care if you are owed. If they say they cannot locate your travel funds on their end it, then you lose. I will never ever fly Avelo Airlines again, and if I am asked by anyone in my area, how I like them, I will always tell them the full story.",,,,,
" Do not book Avelo! They delayed our return flight from Tampa to Raleigh multiple times last night and then cancelled at 11.45pm, minimal notifications regarding the cancelation and didn't offer a rescheduled flight or alternative route. They suggested we attempt to contact their customer service to rebook on another flight home within 7 days, we called customer service multiple times and was on hold for over 45 minutes. Never got a hold of anyone. We ended up having to book a flight home with another airline. Avelo says we will be reimbursed within 7-10 days...will see. No offer to help with hotel accommodations or anything. Horrible customer service.",,,,,
"  I will never fly Avelo Airlines again. The flight down to Wilmington was great! We were very excited to have a direct flight to Wilmington, as my brother lives there. Our experience leaving Wilmington, however, was not so wonderful. My son and I arrived at the airport an hour before the flight was supposed to leave. Wilmington is a small airport, so we had plenty of time. The flight was scheduled to leave at 12:00. We arrived at the gate at 11:35 and the gate was already closed. There were no employees anywhere to be seen to help us. My son started waving to the groundcrew of the airport, got their attention and they ran up the ramp to alert the airline crew. He came back down and gave us a thumbs up. We assumed that they were going to come open the gate and let us on. Nope. Next thing we see is the loading ramp pulling away from the airplane. When the gate crew came back into the airport, we asked why they would not let us on and we were told that they were not allowed to reprint the manifestation. They were young kids that clearly did not care about us, or the other two passengers, one of which was in a wheelchair and had been in the bathroom, that they left behind. When we asked when the next flight out was, we were informed not until Monday. This was on a Friday. Needless to say, we could not wait until Monday to fly home. I spent a lot of money to get us on a flight the next day into Boston. My car however was in New Haven! I then called the airline itself and they said that they did nothing wrong, and that they can close the gates a half an hour before the flight is supposed to leave if they want, even if they do not have all of their passengers on board. No offer of a refund or anything.",,,,,
" We were diverted to Delaware because of weather in New Haven at 12:00 4/17, we landed in Delaware at 2:00, (weather was clear in New Haven by 3:00, our ride that was waiting verified this). We were never informed of when we would fly out, even as we asked multiple times, finally left at 6:30 but when we landed in New Haven we were kept on the plane for 1.5 hours before we were able to get off the plane. Unacceptable, will never fly Avelo again",,,,,
"  My family has flown Avelo several times in the past year with no issues, small airport in New Haven is 10 minutes from home, Prices were comparable to Bradley airport. We flew this same flight back in January. However, our experience on March 26 was a disaster. They’ve added more flights out, 5 planes, one every half hour. There were too many passengers and not enough time to process everyone (website says arrive ahead 90 minutes and boarding pass says 120 minutes, so potentially 4 flights x 189 people each are all there at the same time). Add to this the terminal isn’t completed and they work out of construction trailers! The lines were super long. At one point in the TSA line, we stood in the same spot for over 20 minutes. We finally got through screening area, and an Avelo worker strolled by, saying the FLL flight was closed and everyone had to rebook. We got to the gate at 7:17 for a 7:30 flight; the plane was still there. 40 passengers missed it, and 20 people missed the 8:00 flight. Staff was super rude, just repeating the customer service number to rebook and saying it was our fault not being there on time. To add insult to injury, the plane left 2 minutes ahead of schedule and landed 17 minutes early. We heard later that TSA shut down for a security issue, delaying everyone a half hour. That doesn’t sound like our fault. There are just 2 boarding gates that are literally a 60 second walk from the TSA area. How is it possible that Avelo didn’t think to hold the flight for 10 minutes for 40 people when we were all there? We missed a cruise because even though I could have gotten a plane from Hartford and made it to Florida, my luggage was on the plane. Worse, my trip insurance doesn’t cover missed flights, so I’m out over $3500. Never again Avelo.",,,,,
" I was very disappointed how I had to pay $50 for a carry on, my son was in a wheelchair and could take his own bag. The employee didn't believe me and made me pay. I had purchased 6 tickets and would never fly with this airline again.",,,,,
"  I had my doubts after seeing bad reviews, but both flights were seamless. They left on time and arrived early, even though it was spring break. The smaller airport at Wilmington was easier and quicker to navigate.",,,,,
" Avelo Airlines has to be one of the worst flights I've ever experienced. You really get what you pay for. We were rushed to sit down by very pushy staff, claiming we had to disembark if the plane was not seated at a certain time because they ""had a late start to their day"" because they didn't want to pay for the noisy aircraft fee—that shouldn't be our responsibility. New airline or not, your job should be to get people from A to B as comfortably as possible. The staff service was non-existent, only coming in at the end to collect trash that it'd be impossible to have because again, no one served us anything or even offered. The plane was one of the least smooth I've ever ridden on, you could feel every slight pressure change and altitude change CONSTANTLY, and water kept dropping down from places unknown, and that I'd rather not think about. The seat belts wouldn't fit even a person of average size (I'm around 200 pounds, but not big) and that's at max extension, even the tables were shoved too close into you, but without service what use should you have for them, huh? TLDR: Don't fly Avelo, their incompetence and cheap nature is scathing and reflects how they'll treat you. Your flight will either be cancelled or delayed constantly, so leave early regardless.",,,,,
 Avelo set the bait now they’re yanking on the hook. Reel everybody in with low fares for the first year then raise the rates so you can’t afford them next year. To good to be true. Prices are going up up and away see ya. So much for the little guy!,,,,,
"  Do not expect checked bags to arrive at destination on a 2 hour direct flight!! And do not expect to get your bag for several days. My bag and 6 other people’s bags were no shows at our destination of Binghamton, NY on a Saturday morning. We were told we may have to wait until Wednesday when Avelo flies back to Binghamton! Avelo’s “Baggage Team” does not work weekends or holidays. So there is no one to start working our issue until Monday even though our baggage “delay” happened on a Saturday morning. There is no communication and no updates. Calls to customer service are futile and no supervisor to speak to until Monday morning. Never check a bag with Avelo!",,,,,
" This airline is trying but they could be a lot better. The staff is mostly friendly but there are some really rude people that will kick you out of open seats if you move, etc. which makes zero sense since the plane is in the air. This happened to me and my niece on separate flights. I get that it is their business model but ultimately you are just going to just annoy people and lose business that way (see one-and-a-half-star review). They only offer water which is fine but no one handed it out or even checked on you. The two female flight attendants on my flight just sat in the back and gossiped the entire flight. The pilot seemed kind and the rest of the staff seemed like they somewhat cared but most look tired and were pretty cold. A smile goes a long way in this business.",,,,,
"  My flight was originally scheduled for 0920PM but was delayed about ten minutes before boarding. Hundreds of people were at the gate with the same notification that the flight was delayed until 2AM. The gate next to us was supposed to board 3 hours before we were and were still waiting to find out when they were leaving. The gate attendant disappeared down the ramp and closed the door behind her, leaving the entire area void of any staff to answer any questions. People coming off the plane in wheelchairs were left at the gate without their belongings or their assistance to get to bag claim. I have been unable to get ahold of customer service nor get a refund even though I purchased the insurance. Hearing all the complaints and seeing how delayed others were on their flights headed to Florida hours earlier, I went ahead and booked a flight on a larger airline for the AM and promptly went home. We were given no announcement at the gate and subsequently told there was enough staff to even pull the luggage off the plane. By the time I got up for my flight the next morning, this flight had been delayed an entire 24 hours. I never received any kind of confirmation that the flight even left. The website is unusable and will not even pull up my booking with the confirmation I was given.",,,,,
"  Very frustrating, mainly poor customer service. The employees at the Orlando terminal were not helpful, rude and didn’t share information. The plane was delayed numerous times, but no notifications were given after the first few. There was no explanation for the delay, ever. At one point the employees got on/off the plane with no explanation. And then they all went back on the plane and locked the door. Leaving no employee at all inside the terminal. If you approached the desk or attempted to ask questions you were shooed away or lied to. Then when time to board we were rushed, completely unprofessional and unsafe, onto the plane. No boarding groups at all. Just a big line, they even said “we have 5 minutes to get you on, hurry”. It’s very unfortunate given the lower cost and convenience of flying out of smaller airports that this company can’t do better. Customer service goes a long way. I’ll spread the word to my locals to be wary of this company until they have improved their customer service team, and consider hiring someone else to staff their terminal that is more professional, empathetic, and safe.",,,,,
" Do not fly Avelo! This has been the worst airline experience of my life and I am a seasoned traveler. Delays both ways in excess of 12 hours total with absolutely no information on why or how long. They just kept saying “we’re boarding shortly” which turns into hours. That was after we boarded the first time after a 45 minute delay only to be told we had to get back off and ended up waiting another 5 hours. The desk clerks are rude and there are zero offers or alternatives for reimbursement or accommodations. All they say is call customer service and getting through to is impossible. I recently lost my job so decided to give them a shot since they are so cheap, but never again. Their service is even cheaper and not worth the headache. The only upside was once in the air, it was a smooth flight.",,,,,
"  Cancel, delay, delay last minute every time we book with this airline. Delays that are hours long. Never a free ticket or offer. I’m tired getting in after midnight and who knows on the way to the airport I’m sure I will get a text there is another delay. I know it’s not weather related it’s just incompetence. Last time when we left out of New Haven they charged us five dollars to print our ticket. When we got home I after a delay I found the text that the plane was delayed 15 minutes after takeoff. So how could I have gotten my ticket on my phone when I was already on the plane. They are so cheap plus the lady at the ticket desk was rude. ",,,,,
" First time flying Avelo, staff was super helpful at the Tweed airport! He was super attentive to me and my friend flying and answered all our questions. In all the chaos from a delayed flight he made sure that we were informed and taken care of. ",,,,,
"  As someone who does not enjoy flying, Avelo Airlines was a good experience for me. I was worried about being on a “cheaper flight” but everything seemed similar compared to a non-discount airline. The customer service of the flight attendants was great! They were very personable, friendly, and helpful and made me feel at ease. The only downside was that there is no offer on food or drink on the plane, but it wasn’t a huge deal for a short flight. The only other negative comment was that the plane was overbooked, so 3 passengers had to opt out of their ticket. Overall, Avelo was a good experience and I would fly with them again!",,,,,
"  Avelo changed my flights to days that I can't even travel. I had specific days that I needed to arrive and depart. That was the first issue! Second, I went online (because it is impossible to speak to anyone at Avelo) and canceled the new flights expecting a refund. No! They issued a ""travel credit"". As if I want to fly this airline ever again. I have e-mailed customer support multiple times and have never had a response. I have called Avelo only to wait on hold for over an hour before giving up. I have never had such a poor experience with any company.",,,,,
" I have not ever left a Yelp review before (believe it or not, I dont think I’ve ever left a business review of any kind before this). I cannot emphasize this enough: we will not fly on Avelo ever again. First, our flight (XP 719) was delayed due to being overweight. As a result, 30 passengers were asked to volunteer to take a later flight (yes, overbooked by 30 passengers). We were delayed because Avelo wanted to wait until people took their buyout option, which was raised continuously over the course of an hour until 30 people had accepted. The delay was not weather or technical issue, it was a known mistake by Avelo that we, the passengers, had to simply absorb. Unbeknownst to any of us, Avelo had also decided not to put over half of the checked bags onto the flight. Avelo knew this before we took off and said nothing. We landed and waited for nearly 2 hours at the baggage claim, a group of approximately 40 passengers waiting for our bags. Finally, an agent came to tell us that the bags had never been loaded (again, they made this decision hours ago before departure but did not inform us). Our options were to get in a makeshift line and give our bag claim info (again) to this agent who slowly repeated the claim numbers into her cellphone. We could have Fedex deliver the bags, no promise when they would arrive OR come back to the airport in the middle of the night to retrieve them, but they weren’t sure which flight it would be or the exact arrival time. I was told Avelo would call during the night to confirm my bag had arrived (this did not happen). The next morning I called both Avelo numbers and sat on hold for 90 minutes and 60 minutes respectively, no one picked up. I called Orlando airport’s customer service and was helpfully transferred to an Avelo agent there. That person said my bag was not there and she could not say where the bag was or what the process would be for finding it (“Just call the customer service number!” she said). I began frantically calling the departure airport, was given an Avelo work phone to call, left a voicemail. Then, I received an email explaining that due to weight restrictions, many bags had not been loaded onto the flight, come pick up your bag and get a $50 credit for an Avelo flight. On this email, I saw my name had been wildly misspelled. So, I called Orlando and was transferred yet again to the Avelo agent. She laughed and said, “Oh right! I realized your bag is here after you called, you can come get it.” She could not explain why she didn’t just call me when she found my bag. I had given her my phone number. She could not tell me how to file a claim to be reimbursed for the additional cab fares to and from the airport to get my bag (this doesn't even touch the toiletries and rental car I had to cancel because I was stuck waiting for my bag at the airport the previous day, despite Avelo knowing that my bag was not there). She referred me again to the customer service number that no one answers. As it stands, my wife will need to cancel some of her plans today so that she can be with our son while I cab back to the airport again to find my bag. The total lack of communication and thoughtlessness on the part of Avelo is not something I can forgive. I am generally tolerant of mistakes and unforeseen problems that arise with air travel, its just part of the reality of flying, but to have my time and stress so completely disregarded by this company means that I will not give them my money again.",,,,,
  Flight was cancelled 4 hours before my flight time and I did not get any notification. Got dropped off after driving 1 1/2 hours to airport to told it was cancelled with no other options. Stuck 1 1/2 hours from home with no cares at all from Avelo customer service,,,,,
"  Never again. For so many reasons. Several delays, both ways. Coming back, take off was supposed to be 4:45 pm, actually took off at 930 Pm, after being told screws were missing and they couldn’t get what they needed.  Everything just seemed to take forever and no one really knew what they were doing. Just don’t do it. It’s not worth the Pennies you may save by flying with them.",,,,,
" I was very unhappy with Avelo Airline’s bag check-in service and boarding process at Tweed Airport in New Haven on the afternoon of February 24. I had to take my bag to a check-in clerk in a temporary building attached to the terminal and then wheel it into the terminal after she attached a ticket to the bag. In the terminal I had to push the bag under a plexiglass opening to a TSA person. Next, I prepaid for priority boarding but nobody cared about that. There was a crowd of people trying to push through the gate. The boarding was 100% outdoors. Part of the ramp to the door of the plane was steep.",,,,,
"  This very well could have been the worst customer service experience of my life. The plane arrived an hour ahead of our departure time and everyone looked excited to fly home to New Haven. As our scheduled boarding time came and went all the passengers started to get nervous. About 20 minutes after boarding an announcement was made that they would need to have 29 people off the plane or we could not take off. They offered minor compensation for a huge disruption and only 22 people took the offer. Unfortunately 7 people were denied boarding and told you aren't getting home tonight. As we finally board the plane an hour and a half later I was sat next to a window whose internal frame was no longer attached to the airplane with anything other than my broad shoulders and arm holding it. Even though I understand this is not the ""outer window"" that keeps the plane sealed, it did create an extreme feeling of discomfort for even a seasoned flyer. The airplane felt like a 30 year old relic that had seen better days and was destined to be retired a long time ago. While I will never fly Avelo again for the reasons outlined above, I will say that the flight attendants on all my Avelo flights have been professional and kind to all passengers despite the enormous amount of disappointed customers they have to deal with due to their company structure.",,,,,
"  Avelo Airlines began service out of Palm Springs last November. I needed to travel to Eugene OR for business, so decided I would give them a try. I was scheduled to depart at 1:30 pm - early that morning I began receiving emails from Avelo advising the departure time had been delayed. Over the course of the day I continued to get successive emails (8 emails in all) moving the departure later and later each time. The flight finally departed at approximately 9:00 pm, a total delay of 7.5 hours late. The gate agent said she had no idea why the flight was so late and once on board the pilot only apologized for ""the inconvenience."" The delay was not  due to weather, so no one really knows why. Bottom line: I gave Avelo my business once, but never again.",,,,,
"  My flight from PBI to RDU was delayed twice and was notified via emails, which was ok. Then the flight was cancelled. I found this out at the airport and was never sent an email or text. At the airport after waiting in a very long line for the one attendant, who told me she couldn't do rebooking, I would need to call customer service. I tried three times to reach customer service each time after being on hold for over 30 minutes I would be cut off! I never reached them and gave up! What a waste of time. And waste of money booking another flight at the last second!",,,,,
"  Worst airline experience ever. The most unprofessionally run, amateur outfit I have encountered after 3 million miles flown and 70 countries. Will never fly this airline again. A true embarrassment to the industry.",,,,,
 Don’t do it. The airport is not adequate for the volume of passengers trying to board. The communication and signage is terrible from the moment entering the terminal. Very uncomfortable overcrowded gate area. Definitely not worth the discount price.,,,,,
"  Wilmington to Fort Myers, a route I have flown from different departure airports (BWI and PHL) and airlines many times. The checkin at Wilmington DE was uneventful, I have precheck and always have a personal carryon with an ipad and was instructed to remove it by TSA - a first in all my travels. The waiting room was very crowded and no one was wearing a mask and this the first flight I decided not to wear one. The boarding process was organized and the only issue I had was, my original reservation was for seat 3C but my ticket/boarding pass was for 6C or a seat $3.00 less in value. The flight attendants were quite green and stumbled as they read the canned announcements but were quite pleasant. The flight was on time and disembarking was normal. My one negative was coming down with Covid 3 days later and giving to my wife. I have always worn an N95 when flying commercially and this is the first time I did not and severely regretted it.",,,,,
  You do not get refreshments and in-flight amenities. You’re getting what you pay for: affordable transportation. Avelo flies to and from small regional airports that aren’t serviced or are under serviced by larger carriers and do not have daily service. Check-in was easy on the website. I did elect to pay for seat selection and the $14 was worth have a row to myself. The incoming flight from New Haven was late. So boarding was delayed but the flight itself was not. Quick turnaround time by the staff. The plane is an older 737. The planes do have different cabin configurations. This one had the smaller and harder seats. Still better than Spirit but a similar quality. Took off without issue. The flight itself was uneventful. Unfortunately the weather in CT did not agree with this. It was incredibly windy with a pretty severe amount of turbulence. We had two missed approached and held over the LIS for about an hour. The pilots informed us what was going on after the second attempt when we entered the holding pattern. Unfortunately that was not a particularly fun hour with the turbulence over the water. I fly often and am not a particularly nervuous flier but I was not comfortable.  Be advised at New Haven we had airstairs and had to walk off the ramp and I did not check luggage but luggage claim at Tweed if outside. Traffic at Tweed was horrendous and the airport itself needs to address that if they’re going to have commercial flights. You get what you pay for. Extremely economic transportation in and out of rarely serviced airports. Would fly again.,,,,,
"  Return leg of my last review. The mentality stays the same. You’re getting what you pay for and nothing less. This leg was considerably less eventful than my last trip. I did not check a bag or have a carry on as they are quite pricey. Tweed was a small airport and I was in and through TSA in about an 10 minutes. There was no jet bridge at Tweed for this flight and we entered via airstairs. I have absolutely no issue with this but be advised. Plane boarded and departed on time. This was a former SWA 737 and had a better, more comfortable interior than my last flight. It wasn’t particularly clean but no worse than my last AA or Spirit flight. Cabin crew greeting us when entering the plane but outside of that were nowhere really to be found. They did offer a small bottle of water on this leg about halfway through. If you’re looking for an economical, no frills carrier this is a fairly good one. For the price I can return to where I used to live to visit family monthly if I wish. I will fly Avelo again.",,,,,
"  Excellent experience, all around. Departure at the little airport was so easy, just three people on line for security, so easy and so fast to the gate. The price can not be beat. Gate staff and the flight attendant five stars all around. I had to cancel my return flight and it was extremely easy to reach them by phone to cancel it for a full credit just 36 hours before the flight. My traveling companion had to cancel the bag she pre-paid to bring on the plane and it was very easy for her to cancel over the phone for a full credit.",,,,,
  I don’t understand how there are so many negative reviews. Made sure to keep checking the flight for any changes. The customer service was phenomenal right off the bat. The employees were respectful and friendly. The flight arrived on time and everything was smooth. Aircraft was clean and in order. Flight attendants were helpful. We arrived on time. Well worth the price and more. Will fly again.,,,,,
"  Literally the worst customer service. I called to change my 2 carry on bags to checked bags,. it was going to cost an additional $20. Half way thru the call I said I changed my mind. Customer Service rep,  said I could not change my mind and offered a huge attitude, in which I responded I want to speak to a manager. 18 minutes later a total of 47min on hold, I still had not spoken to a manager. But lo and behold my reservation was returned to how it started. Folks do not make a mistake on your reservation!",,,,,
"  This trip was horrendous - I arrived from Orlando to New Haven on 12/23. Pilot attempted to land at Tweed 4 or 5 times but could not land due to wind (during all this, not one communication came from either the flight attendants or pilot). My family had arrived to pick me up at Tweed only to watch these attempts for over 1 hour, constantly checking status of flight which continued to say on time to finally going into the terminal to be told the flight was rerouted to Bradley in Hartford and landed there several minutes ago. My family proceeded to drive from New Haven to Hartford to pick me up which was now over 2 hours behind schedule. Once we arrived in Hartford/Bradley, we the passengers were notified by the flight attendant/pilot that the doors were frozen and that we were unable to get off the plane. I called my family who told me to tell them to get the deicer and open the door. After another hour (mind you we did not have a gate and waited another hour trying to locate one), the attendant and pilot came on to tell us that were were heading back to New Haven because the wind subsided! I rang my buzzer and told the attendant I wanted off the plane. They finally allowed the passengers off the plane and of course, any luggage that was not carried on would have to be picked up tomorrow in New Haven. If we had arrived as planned, we would have been home at 9PM however because of all of this commotion we did not arrived home until 1AM - mind you New Haven is a 40 minute ride from our house in CT. There never was any communication, no apologies or anything. The story continues on the way back on Wed Jan 4 - we get to the airport on time, everything seems ok, my family heads out after dropping me off. Turns out they overbooked and wanted 4 people to get off the plane and get a 400 voucher - guess what only 1 person would get off the plane - so next saga is that they had to get a bigger plane - so we transferred from 1 plane to the bigger - finally getting off the ground 2 hours after scheduled departure. We arrive in Orlando again only to be told that there is no gate, there is no staff because the plane arrived after midnight, so by the time that was all said and done, we did not get home until 4AM. Its not worth the extra pennies you save on this airline.",,,,,
"  I'm trying to check in to my flight back to Florida and when I try to do the check in through the website it says my booking information can't be found. First few times I tried to call their customer service, the call would drop and I couldn't get anybody on the phone. Now, I finally got the automated call and have been waiting for over an hour to talk to a customer service representative. I understand that this is a cheap flight, but not able to check in and not able to talk to somebody is not acceptable.",,,,,
"  So this has been by far the worst Airline ever! They give you a constant run around with the verbiage of “we will update you every 5-10 mins” yet they update us every 30 mins. I have been stuck here waiting to head back to CT yet I’m stuck at the airport since 1/3/23 at 3.30 pm only to be told at 9 pm that they flight is cancelled and to show up at 5 am to depart by 7 am yet it is 7.38 am and we still have not boarded. They are people here since 1/2/23 dealing with this same issue with Avelo. Crew and staff are not knowledgeable and the customer service is horrendous. Regardless if it’s an “affordable flight” all of this mayhem should not be occurring 3 days in a row. The plane is small, uncomfortable, tight seats, no wifi, no water, nowhere to charge your devices, nothing! If all of this cannot be accommodated, then at least make the experience a good one. Get us on board on time as we are doing our part in being here on time! Now we are being told that we cannot board for the following reasons: They are waiting for the flight crew (unacceptable when we have been here since 4.30 am and told to be here by 5 to depart at 7) secondly now they are saying that the crew arrived but needs a total of 10 hours to be rested. Then why have us here hours early just to be delayed? We were supposed to depart at 7 yet it’s almost 8 am and we are still waiting to be told when we can board. Countless other flights have departed and arrived with no issues and even the ones that have we hear over the intercom information about those flights yet Avelo doesn’t have any. And the excuse is always 5-10 mins we will update you. I sincerely will never fly this airline again and I will inform family and friends who are scheduled to fly within the next few weeks to cancel their flights and get a reimbursement because this is absurd. I’m missing work because of this huge inconvenience and yet nothing has been resolved. Even the so called NEW Boarding Pass did not have the todays date but rather 1/3/23 and we had to wait almost 25 mins to get TSA Management to let us pass the check in section to board the shuttle train to the departure section. Total mess in every aspect. I would have rather flown any other airline and and paid the difference!",,,,,
"  I will never fly with Avelo ever again. On our way out of Kalamazoo I repeatedly received texts saying our flight was delayed further, and further. Finally made it to the airport only to have it delayed yet again. By the time we boarded the plane we were delayed at least 4 hours. Once on the plane, we were told the plane was overweight and they would be removing 13 passengers checked bags from the flight. Of course our name was one of them. Everything I needed for our trip was in the checked bag. Our only 2 options were to stay with the bag and miss our trip, (the next flight they could get us on was Friday, this happened on a Monday) or fly without our bag and they would either A. Send it on Friday with the next plane or B. Overnight it. Unfortunately it is now midnight and they have no answers for us on anything because they're customer service reps are unavailable until 8 or 9 in the morning. So we made the choice, we left our baggage behind and continue on our way. HOWEVER, at this point, another hour sitting on the plane waiting, the pilots are about to timeout. They quickly push back to get into the air, but need to de-ice first. Fine, whatever. We go to take off, the pilot aborts the first take-off attempt and we sit and wait yet again for him to figure out his problem. We FINALLY take off on the second attempt, and it is 6 hours from when we're originally supposed to take off. As for the lost baggage, we finally received our baggage that they left behind on Monday, Saturday. We reached out to customer service every day with Ridiculous hold times, told us they would call us back numerous times, but NEVER did. Finally we received an email with a lost baggage checklist, then they shipped it. Now as for on the way home. Everything went smoother this time, but we still were an hour and a half delayed. Overall terrible experience. Terrible customer service. I don't care about the price, pay more money for another airline and get a seamless experience.",,,,,
"  By far my worst flight experience. My scheduled take off time from HVN was 5:40pm. Around that time we were told that the flight would be delayed to around 7:30 take off. The flight was they re-delayed multiple times ranging from at take off at 6:30, 7:50, 7:00, and back to 7:50. When I asked the staff what was going on the response was “we are doing the best we can”, which I understand; however when you have an entire flights worth of individuals confused on why so many delays, a true explanation should not be that hard to provide - whether it be weather, plane issues, etc. the people deserve to know. Avelo Airlines staff are horrible with communication and delays. In addition, their check in process is awful as they check people in by their flights instead of their place in line causing more backup and confusion. I am now boarding my 5:40 flight at 8:07pm still with no explanation of why it was delayed. Avelo might be a cheap way to travel to certain places via a direct flight, but they are not worth the confusion or hassle.",,,,,
"  Boarded flight from PBI to HVN on 12/31/22. During boarding, there was an issue as two teens weren't allowed to board due to the plane being overweight. Pilot said that we had to carry extra fuel due to weather in New Haven. After 45 minutes of a standoff the girls boarded the plane. No clue what changed to allow that. The first attempt to take off was aborted due to a light going off. We pulled off the runway and waited until that cleared. So an hour after our scheduled departure we took off. We didn't land at our estimated time and it was clear we were circling. When we finally landed 20 minutes after the pilot said we would, he then announced that we were in Hartford. Once in Hartford, we were stuck on the tarmac for 90 minutes until a gate opened up. When it did, we were allowed to deplane with zero communication from flight crew about next steps. In fact, it was only a BDL employee at the gate that mentioned that our bags weren't being unloaded. Hopefully they will show up in New Haven today but we've heard nothing from Avelo and it's impossible to get through to them. I understand that weather happens. I've been delayed and diverted before but the lack of communication and safety concerns were horrific.",,,,,
"  I have traveled with my family over twenty times using different airlines over the past 20+ years. Avelo has been the worst by far. It is supposed to be a cheap way to fly but the tickets were $800 round trip from New Haven CT to Palm Springs. The planes are so old they don’t even have the old school radio in the arm rest, you can’t charge a phone. The seats are so cramped that I couldn’t put my carry on under the seat for the first time ever. They have no snacks on the flight and only warm water but you have to ask. The flight home was a disaster because they sent an update saying that the flight was delayed but when we arrived at the airport we were told it was on time and all boards said on time. There was no agent at the counter to even speak with and the flight ended up being delayed three hours with no updates. Never again will we use this airline, it’s not worth the few dollars that we’re saved.",,,,,
"  Flight 718 Dec 15th 2022 took 27 hours to get from Orlando to New Haven Ct due to Malfunctions related to the aircraft. I slept in the airport. Then my return fight 719 Dec 28th 2022 New Haven was cancelled without any notice all monies refunded. I was told I couldn't get a flight out of New Haven until Dec 31st. After talking to an Agent I was told they refunded the Ticket because of the 27 hour delay in Orland that included my return trip was Cancelled and I was never notified of this. The Agent apologized and was sadden because she could not correct the Cancellation so I was stuck again! Last year 2021 the Christmas flight Orlando to New Haven Ct round trip went well. This year the Round trip delay is 4 plus days. All in all Avelo is providing a service for a cost, you have to decide if its worth it.",,,,,
  Worst experience ever. 3 hour delays to Orlando and back home. No communication explaining delay. Attendants at gates refuse to talk to you or go to tarmac. Overall the worst experience I’ve ever had flying. Will never recommend Avelo to anyone nor will I ever fly Avelo again. Abysmal.,,,,,
  3 h delay both coming and going and 1 1/2 h wait on the plane with some sort of mechanical difficulty (repairmen coming and gong) for that 1 1/2 h. Waiting areas packed and no place to sit. Weather was not a factor. I would think twice before ever flying Avelo.,,,,,
"  I had an amazing time traveling with Avelo, this was one of my first flight from Fort Myers to New Haven. The check in staff are extremely efficient, they check in every customer with a smile on their face. You can really tell they care about you and your travel experience. Sometimes customers are rude to them but they always handle it so professionally. The check in line was very long but but the staff made it move very quickly. I was at my gate in no time, the plane was running a bit behind schedule but nothing to complain about. The aircraft was clean and they even had music playing when we boarded! The crew was very nice and did their best to make everyone happy. Arrived to New Haven not too late and very happy to say my bags arrived too! New favorite airline!",,,,,
"  Travelled to and from New Haven to Ft Myers on Avelo. Never again. A neighbor recommended them. New Haven is reasonably close. So we tried it. Big problems at New Haven airport. Not much parking and expensive. No real gates. You stand out in the cold for 10-15 minutes boarding the jet from the ground. The planes are fine, standard Boeing 737s. The airfare itself is relatively low cost. But the add ons are very high. $45 per carryon or checked bag each way. $180 for checked bags for 2 persons rt. Add $130 for seat assignment rt. You pay $27-$37 for a seat assignment. They also demanded I remove a standard Phillips electric toothbrush from my checked bag. Ridiculous. In 25 years of flying all over the world, only Avelo has forced me to remove a toothbrush from My checked bag! They said was fine to carry it onboard in my carryon bag. Go figure. Incompetence. The website is also very confusing. The site caused me to double book and double pay for my checked bags. I had to request a refund due to the confusion online when I checked in. All In all a very negative experience. They don’t even offer any water on their flights at all. 3 hour flight. Tweed new haven is definitely not ready for prime time. They have limited parking, no gates, not enough room for waiting passengers. A very bad experience. If you have elderly or wheel chair passenger, definitely do not fly with Avelo, or thru New Haven. They will freeze on the ground( tarmac boarding) or trying to board their flight. The price for a professionally run airline like American, JetBlue or Southwest is really not much higher (maybe even less!) and they fly out of real airports, like BDL, JFK, LaGuardia, and White Plains. No drink, no food, no WiFi. Nada. I tried them once, but I will not fly them again. The flights themselves were actual ok, the flight attendants also were friendly/ok, though they clearly have almost nothing to do in the air, no service, Flights just 1hour late, but still a Very bad experience. A Mistake.",,,,,
  Awful experience. Little to no relevant communication. Cancelled a flight with no recourse. Absolutely no consideration for your time. You get what you pay for.,,,,,
"  Absolutely awful experience. My wife and I flew with Avelo for the first time and there was a “maintenance delay” that delayed the flight by 1 hour 30 minutes. Absolutely no communication updating us on the progress until more than 2 hours later. Cannot believe how annoying this was. Then they said it was delayed a further 1 hour 30 minutes. To add to the confusion, they sent out multiple misleading emails with typos and no helpful information and the information boards at the airport never updated. Totally ridiculous.",,,,,
" Only reason why I gave 2 stars is because our flight to our destination was good. Our flight home was bad and Avelo  will not refund our flight even though we were told by an employee there they were refunding us. Let me give you the back story. We left MCO at 10:40am and we’re supposed to arrive to Tweed at 1pm. Around 1pm we started to land, it was very foggy, one second I saw the tops of houses close and the next second we shot back up in the air. The pilot was the only informative person on that plane. He let us know that they couldn’t see the runway due to fog and that we would circle around and try again in 10-15 min and that we had an hours worth of gas left so they were thinking about making an emergency landing at Bradley. After hearing back from air traffic control within those 45 min we stayed circling, they made the decision to emergency land at Bradley. We landed at 2:12. We sat on the tarmac for 15 minutes without being told anything until finally they said they were going to refuel and take off to Tweed again. HOW? How when the fog was still bad. That makes no sense. I would have loved to speak to a flight attendant about how I felt regarding this matter but there were nowhere to be found and the walkway was blocked by people standing or trying to use the bathroom. After an hour of them figuring it out with Bradley, Bradley gave us a gate and we were told we could exit the plane but we would need to stay close as they were going to reboard us and go back to Tweed. Absolutely not. Why again are we trying this when the weather was zero visibility of a very short runway?? So yet again the story changed and we were given 2 options. One was to: stay close and reboard and go back to Tweed or 2: go home and they would not release our luggage to us until the plane landed back at Tweed. With 3 children who had already had enough and were already scared there was no way I was doing option one. After getting off the plane, there was no one to speak to regarding how we will know when our plane would be back at Tweed because Bradley doesn’t serve Avelo so they couldn’t give us information which I completely understand but not one Avelo employee came off the plane to give us any information what so ever. Horrible lack of communication which left many people on that plane very upset, not only just us. And let me add that we had family picking us up so they were waiting at Tweed when I had to text them when we landed that they had to drive an hour to Bradley. So when we left, my husband immediately called Avelo and was on hold for 30 minutes before getting disconnected and then we tried again after that and we were on the phone for an hour and a half without anyone answering so at that point it was close to 9 o’clock and we gave up. We woke up this morning and called them around 10 o’clock and they let us know that our plane landed at 8:30 in the morning. It’s funny how nobody could call us to tell us that especially given all that we had just been through. So my husband spoke to the lady and explained all of this and explained that we should be given a refund for our flight due to the numerous issues that happened and the lady who he spoke to said she was putting the refund through we then drove 45 minutes to Avelo to retrieve our luggage. (Oh and the employee at MCO didn’t provide us with one luggage tag - thankfully that was not an issue).",,,,,
"  The flight from Newport News to Orlando on November 22 was a hour late. It took and hour to get claimed bags the belt was broke. On the way back to Newport News ticket was for 11/29/22 at 6:30 and I get to the airport MCO ,there were no workers at the desk at all. Apparently they changed the flight to the 27th with no warning at all ! Even online an receipts still show flight for 11/29/22. I really don’t mind cheap flights but this one is a big no no for me. I wouldn’t recommend this at all. Had me stuck in MCO.",,,,,
"  Never flying Avelo again. Not only was our first flight delayed by an hour but our second flight out of Orlando was changed to two days in advance of my leaving. My family was never contacted that our flight had been changed. This very unacceptable and now we are stuck in Florida without anyway back home. Do not fly Avelo, spend the extra and fly expensive, it may be more expensive however you get better customer service and your flight won’t get changed by literal days. The customer service agent we talked to hung up on us multiple times and basically gave us no way home.",,,,,
"  My experience with Avelo Airlines was one my family and I would never forget. We had a great time flying from Orlando to new haven. But coming back to Orlando my family and I were surprised when the flight attendant recognized my daughter for her upcoming birthday on November 28th. She had the passengers flicker their lights to congratulate her which was very special as this was our first time flying in years. I was one happy mama and proud as well. They also gave her the wings that the flight attendants wear and to top it off the captain himself came out and wished her a Happy Birthday. That was very kind of him and such class. I never got to take a picture with him and my daughter which was a bummer, I didn't want to hold up the line behind me. Thank you Avelo for such an amazing experience I will definitely fly with you again. Shout to Avelo Airlines Flight XP 721 and the Captain.",,,,,
"  Never flying with this airline ever again. My 10:30am flight was cancelled and rebooked to a 6:15pm flight. Without receiving any notification, email, text, or otherwise, the flight was delayed more and more until finally it got delayed to the next day at 11:30am. I was only aware of this flight delay because I luckily was tracking their flight status directly on their website. Thank goodness I did because my phone app and ticket on the browser did not update with the delays at all. I’m shocked at not only the lack of communication and basic technology but also that Avelo doesn’t reimburse you for anything. You only get reimbursement if you stay at a hotel. I luckily was able to get last minute accommodation with a friend, but unluckily that means I get no reimbursement whatsoever for saving them money by finding free accommodation all while having to deal with this back and forth. The ticket is crazy expensive for what it is ($45 for carry on too!) so was really expecting something better. Absolutely avoid this airline wherever possible. If prices at other airlines for last minute tickets hadn’t shot up, I’d 1000% be flying with another airline right now.",,,,,
"  They changed the time on the flight from early morning to afternoon. When we arrived, the flight was delayed three different times, finally our plane we were supposed to fly on was ready, but we were informed our bags had been mistakenly sent to another state on a different plane. So we boarded the plane and sat for another 45 minutes before we were told the plane had another mechanical issue and we would have to deplane. We are now waiting for another to aircraft to come get us…. Supposedly the silver lining is that our bags are being sent back from Georgia to Connecticut and before we takeoff will be loaded onto this point. No matter how the story ends, I will be avoiding this airline in the future. While the staff is polite, they certainly are not very well, trained and this day has been a complete waste.",,,,,
"  
I booked 2 round trip tickets for Thanksgiving months ago. The back in August 2022 I got a message from Avelo saying our return flight had been changed. I tried emailing their ""customer support"" several times but received no response. I tried calling several times but no one answers after waiting for hours. Today I went to print my boarding pass and learned our departure time had been changed, but never received an email or phone call but Avelo alerting me to the change. I then went to check on our return flight and now they no longer list any return flights that day ! Again no one answers when you call customer support. Will try to sort it out at the airport, but now have now confidence in this airline. How can they change flight times without informing the passengers? !! I'll never fly Avelo again.",,,,,
"  Flew on Tuesday before Thanksgiving. No problems at all. I have to admit I do not like that we not even offered a drink. So you need to make sure that you carry on a beverage of your choice and any snacks as there is nothing on the plane. The plane was not full so the stewardess offered people to move to another seat so they could stretch out. It was very expensive but I assume that it was because of Holiday travel. I would fly again, as very pleased with this airline",,,,,
"  We were to fly from Burbank on Thursday 11/17 to Idaho on Avelo Airlines, as we arrived at Burbank, we received a text saying that our flight has been canceled due to maintenance problems, so far, I have called, emailed and have not heard anything from this company. We tried to book another flight while we were at the airport but to no avail, so the 5 of us returned home and are trying to recoup other monies that we paid for such as parking at the airport, renting car and most of all ruined a family function that we had planned for months. Also vacation times were used and lost time for work has occurred and no vacation. I will never ever use this airline ever! where is the customer service, there is none, I hope that I get reimbursed, and I won't lose my $1000 that I paid for. I will also erase this company name from any of my contacts.",,,,,
"  On November 11, 2022 I had (2) reservations to fly from Sarasota, FL to New Haven, CT. Upon arrival at the airport, there was not a single soul at the Avelo Check-in station. The tickets were booked on November 9, 2022. I tried to get e-mailed boarding passes immediately upon purchase on 11/9/2022. Avelo's preferred method of check-in through their website was not available on Wednesday 11/9/2022, Thursday 11/10/2022 or Friday 11/11/2022. Again, there was not a soul in site when we arrived at the Sarasota, FL (SRQ) airport at the Avelo desk at all for any help. We had been trying to check-in for three days with absolutely no luck. After waiting at their ""customer lack of service desk"" for a significant amount of time, we ran to the security check-in to see if we could get through using our IDs. Needless to say that was a joke. I waited on hold for a total of 1 Hour and 52 Minutes to be told that helping us find a flight out of an airport 3 hours South of us could be arranged for $700.00 more may or may not be an option. The CSR (that refused to give her CSR number) was downright rude and unhelpful, if not downright disrespectful. We are now not going to make it to our family reunion and are totally heartbroken. I wholeheartedly give this airline and their representatives an absolute ZERO for my review and will never recommend that anyone consider booking with them because it is completely meaningless. This is the first negative review that I have given in all of my 51 years.",,,,,
"  No complaints. Super cheap. Direct flight. No delays. As you should expect, ones to pay for checked bags. Absolutely going to fly them again. Old plane, but Newport News airport is easy and everyone was nice.",,,,,
"  I read reviews about this airline prior to boarding I seen a bunch of bad reviews but fortunately that was not my experience. We had no delays, seat was comfortable and staff was very nice and helpful. I really enjoyed Avelo as a first time flyer and glad they brought it to Lexington. I hope they bring some more locations for us to fly to other than Tampa soon, I’ll definitely fly again!",,,,,
"  Avelo’s customer service is terrible. Hold times greater than an hour. Our plane had a technical issue, which can happen, but we were left in the dark relative to what was going on. Very poor communication. Our departure time was supposed to be 6:30 pm and we ended up leaving at 1:30 am. Apparently the needed plane repair parts were in New Haven so they flew a plane to Charleston with the parts and took us back to New Haven on the return flight. If that wasn’t the case I’m not sure what we would have done. The airport closed at 4:30 am. There was no guidance from Avelo. They need to do better!",,,,,
"  I flew Avelo round trip from BWI to HVN (Baltumore, MD to New Haven, CT). I had a completely normal, predictable trip that completely fulfilled my expectations. I read all the fine print. I knew I was on a discount, regional airline, and I did all the things to stay at the base rate. I safely flew in one hour each way at a sale rate rate $50–total. That is less than tolls and gas to drive the 5 hours, and I consider this option to see my kids a total blessing. All the employees I encountered on the ground and in the air were friendly and professional. I will be using Avelo again. I will be prepared, informed, and remember that air travel is a privilege.",,,,,
  I have a flight booked for this Friday. Went through Avelo website to book my flight .. my itinerary says I paid 97$ for my one way flight 40$ for my carry on bag and 27$ for my seat. Total on my itinerary was 186$ when I booked it. After about an hour I logged onto my bank statement. It showed Avelo airlines took out 236$. 50$ more than what I originally thought I paid. After being on hold for 52 minutes inquiring about this charge the woman I finally spoke with after 52 minutes of being on hold proceeds to tell me that they decided to change my itinerary and charge me 50$ more after I booked my initial flight and the only way I found out was by checking my bank statement. So even though I was not informed nor booked for the price I thought I was initially paying. She told me if I wanted to keep the flight that the 236$ was final. I do not recommend this airline as they will take more of your money than what you think your initially paying. I'd give them zero stars if it were an option.,,,,,
"  We were delayed an hour but no mention of it at all. Not while we were waiting or no apology on the plane. Like it never happened. Now I’m dealing with the same thing on the way home. I wouldn’t have known unless I asked. No email or text or nothing. This is the fourth time I’m flying with Avelo and it has happened 50% if the time with no communication. It really sucks when someone is waiting to pick you up. They really need to get better at communicating. They ask for all your information, but for what?",,,,,
"  So far I flied twice thru Avelo airline this year. I didn’t not have much other problems with this airline except their bag policy, I thought the airfare was pretty cheap when I made the reservation thru online but when I got to the airport to check in at the desk, the employee said I may have to pay extra for the carry on bag. Their policy said I can take the bag in the plane as long as the size of the bag is under their required size. I didn’t pay for the bag that time but he said I have to pay from next time.",,,,,
" Every single time I have flown with this airline my flight has been pushed back by hours the week before. Sometimes multiple times the week before. And every single time it has been pushed back by hours once again two hours before the flight. It never fails, I always end up buying a ticket to have a day or at least half a day to spend with my family and lose that entire first day. Don’t save the money, spend more for a better airline. You will not get refunds for canceled tickets only travel points so if you buy a ticket and don’t like the drastic change you can’t fix it anyway. I kept trying this airline because it is a direct flight and saves two hours or so from connecting, might as well go with that anyway because the flight changes are so drastic you’ll lose more hours trying to fly direct than the “longer” flights anyway.",,,,,
" New Haven to Myrtle Beach. Avelo changed our flight, never notified us and I only found out because I couldn’t check into my flight. I called and waited almost 2 hours to connect to someone to be told our flight was moved to the day before and we weren’t sent an email - never got one. Checked every junk spam folder etc, nothing. So Avelo sends me a screen shot of the email confirmation with the departure and arrival date for that flight as the original date I had booked, not the one they changed it too! Over a month now and can barely talk to anyone - lost $1200 on an emergency flight home because Avelo couldn’t get us out for another 2 days I believe it was. Customer service has been a nightmare, hours on hold and just hanging up, giving up. Getting connected and transferred around and no one able to Help because it’s someone else’s issue who deals with it. Going on “hearing from a manager” for a week And a half Now, no reply to Email sent by me twice or call. Wrote again today, see what happens. The flight crew was an absolute gem, it’s too bad the rest ruined our time with Avelo. Maybe someone out there will Help me change our tune to Avelo, by out there I mean the airline actually trying to rectify the issue they created and are responsible for. I’ll even take that call from a manger I’ve been waiting a week and a half for. Update two weeks later the manager finally reached out and has been no help whatsoever claims there’s nothing wrong on their end and will not give me their information to help my email company. See if those emails ever came through their domain. The absolute worst customer service I have ever seen or dealt with. the worst part is there’s reviews online that same issue. I had pretty much to a T and when that was brought up, they stated “good to know we will look into it.” But according to me, they don’t make mistakes only us people having the same problem multiple times.",,,,,
"  Do not take this airline! In response to your question, no it is not worth it. My plane was delayed 10 hours. There was no one at the desk to talk to. There was no information provided. We were told that if we left we would not get another flight because this one was not canceled. We were treated terribly.",,,,,
  Never fly these clowns! Flight delayed no reason then last minute canceled? On hold for 4 hours then when connected hung up on. I do not care how inexpensive they are this is unacceptable. I will make it my mission to make sure people from New Haven never fly their airline!,,,,,
"  Avelo customer service is the worst. During a flight delay, I found an Avelo employee at the counter and was told she could not help me. I spent 2 hours on hold with customer service only to hang up because it timed out. Per a recording, I was offered to leave my phone number for a call back but that was full. When I finally got to the airport for my connecting flight there was no one at the counter and was told by security that customer service leaves within 10 minutes of the last flight and I’d have to use a service phone. I finally make it to the gate only to find out the wrong gate number was printed on my boarding pass. I missed the flight and the next flight out was 4 days away. I sent 2 emails a month ago and received an email today stating “they are working on it.”",,,,,
"  Agree with other reviewer, worst experience ever flying. Flight was delayed for 4 hours … then cancelled last minute. Leaving us all stranded in Eugene. We were all told that another flight would not be available for another 2 days! Several other passengers had been canceled the 3 days previously … 3 times cancelled in a row!! 2 of these were young girls flying alone and were sobbing in the airport after hearing they were being cancelled for a 3rd time. No offer of help from the gate agent, he said he didn’t work for Avelo. Hundreds of additional $$$ spent on a hotel for that night (flight was cancelled at 8:00 pm) taxis and cost of 2 flights home the next day, we couldn't wait 2 days for a flight home as we have jobs, children, pets in boarding, and lives to get back to. Hours upon hours spent on the phone trying to reach “customer service” (what a joke!) to then be told by a surly agent that you have to email in a claim, not call it in. Have heard nothing in nearly 2 weeks after we went in our email claim, nothing. Called them again and asked for management, was told the manager’s name but he does not take phone calls. The moral of the story here is “you get what you pay for” do not fly Avelo. On the plus side, Avelo did distribute a generic email offering us $100 worth of travel credit towards a future flight with them.",,,,,
" Eugene to Burbank. This was without a doubt the worst airline experience I’ve ever had. Avelo cancelled our flight from Eugene, OR to Burbank, CA without any type of heads up. We found out when we got to the airport. They said the next flight out would be two days later, which was so frustrating because we all have lives and jobs to get to and not everyone can wait around an extra two days. We ended up spending an extra $500 for last minute tickets from Portland to Burbank via Southwest Airlines (which was a much better experience!!), not to mention the $100 it cost to get a shuttle from Eugene to Portland (2 hours away). I have yet to get a refund from Avelo for this flight, and customer service is impossible to reach. Needless to say, I will never fly with Avelo again and advise that travelers look elsewhere. Avelo also claims to have lower prices, but once all the fees and additional things are added, you really aren’t saving much money.",,,,,
"  I tried to buy extra luggage from Europe (Holland) on top of my regular day pack. The payment system did not work. I tried multiple cards my master card and visa and both gave the same error. I created a ticket, I called many different numbers and in the end they let me pay 120 euro's instead of the 85 that was shown initially on the website. Budget airline no coffee, food or whatever is all fine for me, but letting the customers pay for errors on your website in my opinion is incredibly inappropriate. ",,,,,
"  I have been flying this airline since I was a kid for over 20 years. It used to be one of the best airlines but the last few trips have proven that this airline is mediocre at best. They provide no food or drink for an international 5.5 hour flight between NYC to BOG, you pay for a carry on and they force you to check it because they claim to have no space. They have no WiFi, no screens, no entertainment and no outlets. You pay premium prices for a budget airline. Their counter staff and flight attendants had attitudes and were genuinely unhelpful. I felt like I had a paid ticket but wasn’t entitled to anything. Like I had to thank them to even let me on the plane. That’s how worthless I felt as a customer. They’re making money off of everyone with their fares being so pricey and not including a carry on. They wanted to charge me for a duffel bag because they said it wouldn’t fit under my seat yet they let people on with HUGE shopping bags that took up overhead space. Suffice to say I’m no longer a customer of this airline. They aren’t what they used to be",,,,,
"  Needless to say Avianca has the worst customer service. My family flew from New York to Bogota. As they were doing the check ins we had to go to one of the counters because we needed to pay for one of the suitcases. The suitcases were oversized so we had to go back and arrange everything. We did it and were ready to check the suitcases back again. As we were waiting in line, one of the personal from Avianca told us to come with him that he would check the suitcases that were ready and instructed to leave the suitcase that we had to pay in line. As I followed him and showed him the suitcases he immediately told us “Where are the passengers, I also need the passports to check in the suitcases” mind you as he said this he said it in a very rude way giving us orders as we were animals or something like that. I instantly got tired of his attitude and told him to calm down and not to talk to us that way. He started acting as if he didn’t know what I was talking about, so one of my family members (my uncle) went to him and told him that it was unbelievable the way that he was acting. As he said that another personal from Avianca had the audacity to tell my uncle that if he wanted to be respected he had to respect other.  Definitely it was a very bad experience and do not recommend to fly Avianca.",,,,,
"  Unbelievable! Never in my 30 years of flights have I encountered such a horrible experience. I booked one way (thank God) to Ecuador and they had us waiting for about an hour before take off without any info. There was not even a cup of water available. The air vents above our seats dispenses hot air in an already hot cabin. The directions to access the wifi were clear, but no service was ever available. Overall a horrible experience.",,,,,
"  I am writing to express my profound disappointment with Avianca's handling of two of my trips. The sole purpose of booking the second trip was to utilize the credits provided as compensation for the previous disastrous experience. Avianca canceled our reservation without any prior notification or approval after we submitted a refund request to modify the final leg of our flight. They refunded a mere $387, disregarding the $1,132 we had originally paid and cancelled the entire flight without approval. Furthermore, the refund request email actually said “rejected” so we showed up to the airport thinking nothing changed from our original plans. The lack of communication regarding this refund and the cancellation of our trip is completely unacceptable. Avianca's incompetence and failure to communicate are deeply concerning. The airline's subpar customer support and inefficient processes are costing both customers and the company unnecessary time and money. This issue should have been resolved within a reasonable timeframe, not after spending over five hours discussing it without resolution. In total, I’ve spent over 15 hrs with their support team including my first initial experience. I would advice all customers, employees and investors to stay away from this terrible company.",,,,,
"  This is a terrible company to fly with, when you purchase a ticket you are no advise to upgrade anything but you get hit with sub charges for carry on luggage. I would not use this company (Avianca) for any reason any longer.",,,,,
"  Terrible airline in every way. I hope this so called airline goes out of business. It will be a great opportunity for Colombia to really have an airline that truly represents such a beautiful country. Their prices are equal to a big carrier but in reality they are a low quality budget airline. No food or water, very uncomfortable seats that don’t recline and zero entertainment. Their so call Wi-if and entertainment connection don’t work and their onboard staff are rude and careless. This is literally Greyhound with wings. I will do everything on my power to never fly with them ever again. Save your money and go for a better carrier.",,,,,
"  Purchased tickets via Priceline. Brought tickets months in advance so we did not see the warning to arrive between 1-3 hours before the flight departure. However, we still arrived on time (1 hour a few minutes before flight departure). Our passports were scanned, the agent walked away to speak with his manager for a few minutes and returned to tell us we are late for check in and cannot get on our flight in an hour. Attempted to force us to pay 200 per passenger to change the flight for the next day online since they can not change ticket reservations for some odd reason in person. Told us to go to a different area to call customer service, customer service not only gave us a run around but hung up the phone a few times while he tried figuring everything out. Was able to speak to a manger who informed us to contact Priceline. Contacted Priceline and they refused a refund unless Avianca approved. However, they refused to speak with price line on our behalf or give us an email address of direct line for a refund. Will never recommend doing business with this company especially now that I’m seeing all these horrible reviews. I wish I did my research earlier.",,,,,
"  Worst airline ever. Don’t fly Avianca. Paid $1200 a ticket and didn’t even get a drink or a snack. They didn’t even have everything on their menu. Seats didn’t recline, no tv screens at each seat, no internet. Crew didn’t know what they were doing. The flight was from 9:15 pm -2:15 am. They handed out forms to fill out like 1:45am to fill out and the crew was no help filling them out. Then 10 minutes later they announce all trays up. How stupid how can you fill out the forms. Why didn’t they hand the forms out at the beginning of the flight when everyone was awake.  They deserve to go out of business and I hope they do.",,,,,
"  No food, drinks offered unless you buy it. They did not have everything offered in the menu, in particular no sandwichs. The airport staff in Miami was unfriendly, no ear sets offered and you have to use your phone to use the multimedia that was not working 100%. Really a disaster!",,,,,
" After checking in at the gate. On the return from Guatemala Avianca employees there took from us carry-on water and other beverages that we had just purchased before allowing us onto the plane. Then the flight attendants waited an hour or so later an hour or so later, to pass out beverages for purchase. Seems the airline is inventing security concerns just so it can squeeze an extra buck from customers while making those of us taking the flight feel as uncomfortable as possible. The flight delay of an hour meant connecting flights were nearly missed. Message from captain made it sound like they thought they were on time.",,,,,
  This is the worst airline ever. Flew from NY to Medellin. Absolutely no entertainment. They don’t even offer you water for a 5+ hour flight. Seats are extremely uncomfortable and very tight. I chose Avianca because I didn’t want to connect but next time I’ll pay extra $$ for better service and comfort. Upon arrival to MDE they let someone leave the airport with my luggage and they had no urgency in getting my bag back. I waited 4 hours at the airport and finally got my things back on my own. Then returning from MDE to JFK I was flagged with “SSSS” (first time ever) and they couldn’t even explain why I was on the line waiting or what was the proper protocol. They were very nasty and I would never fly with them. Would not recommend.,,,,,
" The worst customer service! My friend and I were traveling to Lima. On our way to Lima, our flight was delayed for almost 12 hours, we were supposed to land at 09.00 and instead came to Lima very late, after 01.00 in the morning the next day. My luggage was also damaged on the way. While I was returning to LA. I had a checked luggage, it was a small carry on, 12.5 kg, I had another carry on with me (even smaller). While I was boarding, the representative for Avianca at Lima Airport was very rude and inappropriate and kept arguing that I had to pay for that small carry on and charged me 80$. Her attitude was very bad and inappropriate. Our plane was almost empty and there was space for every customer to take carry-ons. I flew so many times, and this has never happened to me. Inadequate customer service! Stay away from this company!",,,,,
" Flight AV651 departing from Cancun at 1410 June 11th. Absolutely horrible staff within every department. We spent our entire holiday in Cancun trying to get in contact with your customer service in order to add baggage for our flight. Obviously this was made impossible and the customer service reps let me know that the option was apparently “not available”. I was made to pay an additional $140 for checked baggage which ended up costing more than our flight! Boarding the plane, we were hit by the rudest flight attendants we have ever encountered on our last 18 months of our travel. Absolutely terrible, either Avianca can’t train their employees or isn’t paying them enough. Go figure! Nothing was sanitised, they couldn’t even take the time to refill toilet paper and hand soap in the bathrooms. You’d think the “Avianca” experience is over at this point. But no, we landed in beautiful SJU and found that our $140 checked baggage that again. Cost us more than the tickets themselves was damaged. We haven’t yet assessed the contents of the bag. But it looks like it’s been dropped from a two storey building and wheels are broken. It’s worth noting, this bag had a fragile tag on it. Just going to show how much Avianca really cares! Scam of a lifetime, will opt to walk over using Avianca in the future!",,,,,
"  While we were at the check-in counter, the customer service agent questioned whether I had a ""medical permit"" to fly because of the bandages around my head. Unfortunately, she assumed that I had undergone a surgical procedure when it was actually a minor medical treatment involving stitches. The stitches had been removed by the doctor three days ago, and I had been cleared to travel. Despite explaining the situation to the agent, she insisted on the necessity of a ""medical permit"" and refused to allow me to board without one. Notably, Avianca's website does not mention this minor medical procedure as a requirement for a medical permit. This mishandling of the situation by Avianca resulted in us missing our flight. They made no attempt to rebook us on the next available flight and instead provided us with a piece of paper instructing us to contact their corporate office. Additionally, they have refused to provide a refund, even though we had paid to upgrade to Business Class the previous night, and they have not offered any flight credit to compensate for their error. As a result, we had to spend $2700 to book a flight with Delta Airlines, which had no issue with allowing us to board. During our 15-hour wait at Terminal 3 in GRU, we decided to inquire with ticket agents from other airlines if they required a ""medical permit."" Out of the four airlines, we asked, none of them required such documentation and we boarded our Delta Airlines flight with no problem. Avianca's customer service sucks.",,,,,
"  This was my worst experience with this airline, 6 hours international flight, no light meal or even a cup of water. Even you want purchase of food, not everyone has credit card, Chair uncomfortable. No toilet paper on WC, the flight attendant are lazy to clean up or put some toilet paper, when I asked for toilet paper one of the flight attendant she just passed me a toilet paper with wrap around of plastic so I had to do her job and put toilet paper in bathroom. If that airline was cheap like many other airlines in world they are cheap and don’t provided food and that is okay, but they price is same as Canadian or US airlines.",,,,,
"  On my first trip to Canada traveling with paid assistance by Air Canada from Cali to Toronto on June 4th 2023 which I had to make a connection with Bogota I had a very unpleasant experience with this airline. Taking my flight on June 4 2023 from Bogota to Toronto flight  is a long flight at my age of 75 years. I did not receive water or food on the plane. On arrival at the Toronto YYZ airport and immigration with assistance, the lady in charge told me that I would claim my suitcase here and she left me there and left, where I lasted more than half an hour looking for my suitcase that, because it was a carry-on, was supposed to have been with me at all times. When this lady from the airline left me alone in the luggage section.",,,,,
"  The service provided by the Wamos crew was amazing however it is extremely disappointing that Avianca has declined in the service they provide to their patrons. The food is awful, I am a vegetarian and there are zero options for me on this flight. It is a 7 hour flight and this is simply disappointing. Further, water, coffee and tea…really Avianca. I understand that you are one of the few airlines that manages a direct flight to Bogotá but this is outright ridiculous. It’s a shame you allow Wamos staff to have to take the brunt of the blame when it is actually the airline that is lacking in providing the customer service. Shame on you! I will not fly your airline again and I will not recommend your airline to anyone I know. It’s simply unacceptable customer service and a complete slip from the excellence that Avianca provided pre-pandemic.",,,,,
"  This company is terrible, there was a mistake in my parent’s name, they got to the airport 3 hours before their flight, the people at the window were not able to fix their ticket. They were told only way they could have the name corrected was by calling customer service, so they called but never got to talk to anyone, they were offered another flight in 3 days. The whole family was already waiting for them and it was impossible for them to wait 3 days. I can’t understand why if their seats were already confirmed why they couldn’t do the simple name change? We lost that money and Avianca won’t refund anything or at least offer a voucher for future travel. They had to buy a whole new ticket with another company and we did enjoy our vacation but not thanks to Avianca.",,,,,
" Avianca is a shame! In an international six-hour flight they did not offer any drinks or food. Not even a glass of water! Everything had to be purchased and payment could only be done with a credit card. No earphones were offered, so no one could use the entertainment system. My fellow Argentinean passengers - many of them elders or people with infants - deplaned in a serious state of exhaustion, dehydration, and frustration. I found out about this horrific service in advance, from a Colombian friend, and so I was well prepared with large water bottles and sandwiches. If anyone has to fly Avianca, let's all bring on board smelly fried chicken, boiled eggs, and let's all purposely be messy, let's leave their planes full of grease and wrappers and egg shells - a small act of resistance!",,,,,
  This airline is one of my worst experience. The customer service is not good. My flight got cancelled and I didn’t receive any emails from them. My next flight was the next day and they charged me &100 dollars for a carry on. Never again. It was my first and my last trip with them.,,,,,
"  Avianca I traveled to Colombia from Canada, a 6-hour flight one way on an 320 and back on an A319. I paid $1,150 dollars and they don't give a drop of water, the seats are super uncomfortable.  Avianca viajé a Colombia desde Canadá, un vuelo de 6 horas a la ida en un A320 y de regreso en A319. Pagué $1,150 dollares y no dan ni una gota de agua, los puestos super incómodos. Es el colmo con esta compañía como abusa de sus usuarios. Invito a no volar con ellos",,,,,
"  Horrible airline! Our flight from Costa Rica to El Salvador was delayed. When we got to the connecting flight to Los Angeles that we barely made, they notified us that they had changed our seats which we had booked for an additional price. They told us with an attitude to get a refund. They declined the request claiming seat upgrade purchases are not refundable even when the airline made the change. Only after I followed up, they gave me a credit that can only be used on future seat purchases but it's practically money lost since I'm never, ever going to fly with them again! The reason why we upgraded our seats was because on the way to Costa Rica the flight was so terrible, we felt we couldn't take it on the way back. The whole experience was atrocious. From the service, to their old falling apart planes, to the miserable flight attendants, to their subpar website. Avoid it all! My 1/10 rating is generous.",,,,,
 I do not recommend flying with Avianca! Flight delayed for more than eight hours without any compensation. We had to spend the night in the airport. Terrible experience.,,,,,
"  I just landed Toronto from Lima via Bogota using Avianca. The lady in Lima airport was very rude. I requested her to allow to take my small luggage as a carry on but she refused. When I on board the plane AV74, I saw there are at least 10 percent luggage bigger than mine. I have decided not to use this Airline in future, not recommend this airline to anybody.",,,,,
"  The worst airline experience we have encountered in 40 years as a tour operator with thousands of flights under our belt. Horribly slow check in (hidden baggage costs in excess of $500), unfriendly and rude staff, ridiculous deplane and third security check in San Salvador. Onboard the seats are tiny, don’t tilt and have no headrests. There was no control about the boarding process and seat selections were not honoured or followed. Essentially a free for all. There are no inflight movies and they charge $3US for water and serve instant coffee for a fee. The only food available was an inedible wrap or sugar foods. I booked my flight through Air Canada and was surprised they partner with Avianca who should be removed from the Star Alliance as they do not honour status. Overall the worst flight and airline company.",,,,,
  They almost charged me $85 dollars because I couldn’t fit my book in my bag which I was carrying in my hand. Absolutely ridiculous. Terrible customer service they really don’t care and just want you to pay them. Mean people and treat you poorly. ,,,,,
"  This is the absolute worst airline I've ever flown.. Each of the 4 legs of our trip had tremendous issues, inconvenience, and staff who are rude and don't seem to care. The ultra-short layover seems to be intentional to cause people to miss their flights. We watched another flight leave half a plane of people behind in their rush to close the doors, knowing there was another connecting flight. When I say zero amenities, I mean absolutely nothing.",,,,,
" Prices are horrible, in flight service is horrible. Just a terrible airline. It's also impossible to resolve anything with them. It's an embarrassment that this it the main Colombian airline.",,,,,
  Booked round trip Toronto-Costa Rica and forgot to add Carry on luggage. Upon boarding the plane in Toronto I was pull aside to pay for carry on and the cost was $120 USD one way! Without much to do; I paid. On the way back I called in advance to add carry on at a cost of 55 USD and the customer service person confirmed payment was completed. Days later I arrived to the airport and once again was pull aside during boarding; apparently my transaction didn't go thru despite the fact customer service confirmed it was; and was asked to pay $95 USD. I submitted a complain and got confirmation that my transaction was booked but apparently was cancelled after the fact; although they acknowledge that it was an issue on their end; they still would not reimburse the cost difference. Regardless of the cost difference; the fees are insane. Can airlines just include all in the base fare and don't surprise customers with those crazy fees? Airlines just get away with a lot of customer abuse.,,,,,
 Avianca failed to take me to my final destination and refused to take responsibility for my travel. I purchased a round trip ticket with them from IAD to LPB. Instead of going LPB to IAD via Bogota I was rerouted due to their delays. They rerouted me to LIMA and then LAX and left me there after 30h of travel! I had to purchase a last minute one way ticket on AA for $678 and am dealing with endless portals for complaints with Avianca and no one can take responsibility for the inconvenience and cost out of my pocket due to their mistakes! Incredibly incompetent and frustrating! Never fly them again! Btw - On the way to LPB bathrooms didn’t have toilet paper?,,,,,
"  The worst crew, the worst airline ever flown. USA has a requirement of bags being rechecked at the aircraft and all airport bought drinks had to be thrown out - why do they do that when in the USA you can buy drinks at the airport and take them on board. I asked for water 4 times and the stewardess refused to bring me water. I went to the galley and asked for water and she started at me then got up from her playing on the phone and gave me half a cup. When I was done and returned the cup to her she asked me to wait on line for the toilet and put it in there. Is this how you train your staff. If I had a choice of airline or seat this would not be the one I would choose - this was part of a package I bought and my flight was changed later after the booking, now know better in the future.",,,,,
